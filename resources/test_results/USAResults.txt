The press should be asking why Hunter Biden’s business associates—like Eric Schwerin—had that privilege and were given access to the Obama White House,” Sen.

It’s well past time for the corporate media to demand the truth from Joe Biden. The corruption of Biden Inc. must be exposed.”\n\n“It’s increasingly obvious that Hunter Biden’s business revolved around providing access to his father and the highest levers of power. It reeks of pay-to-play. The clear solution is a Special Counsel investigation to fairly investigate the disturbing allegations of Biden family corruption,” Sen.

The article was banned for a time by Facebook and Twitter, labelled as “unsubstantiated” by other news outlets and as “Russian disinformation” by intelligence agents and members of the Biden campaign.\n\nThe New York Times published a report last month, more than a year after the fact, claiming to authenticate the emails from the laptop by citing anonymous sources.\n\nThe White House has refused to comment on the laptop in the wake of The New York Times article.\n\nRepublicans in Congress are renewing promises to investigate Hunter Biden with the latest revelations about Schwerin’s access to the White House.\n\n”Not everyone gets to meet the vice president of the United States in the White House. The press should be asking why Hunter Biden’s business associates—like Eric Schwerin—had that privilege and were given access to the Obama White House,” Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) told the New York Post. “This is additional evidence that Joe Biden lied when he said he never discussed Hunter’s foreign business dealings. It’s well past time for the corporate media to demand the truth from Joe Biden. The corruption of Biden Inc. must be exposed.”\n\n“It’s increasingly obvious that Hunter Biden’s business revolved around providing access to his father and the highest levers of power.

Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) and Mike Braun (R-Ind.) at an April 26 Senate Committee on Appropriations hearing.\n\n“As I said during my nomination hearing, the investigation is being run by and supervised by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware. He [David Weiss] is supervising the investigation, and I’m not at liberty to talk about internal DOJ deliberations—but he is in charge of that investigation, and there will not be interference of any political or improper kind,” Garland said, also declining to comment on whether other senior DOJ officials have been briefed.\n\nHagerty expressed skepticism at Garland’s promise, given recent statements from the White House regarding Hunter Biden’s innocence.\n\n“I wonder why the president is resorting to go to TV and … his surrogates. Earlier this month, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain said on TV that the president is confident that his son didn’t break the law, and the White House communications director said President Biden maintains his position that his son did nothing that was unethical,” Hagerty said.\n\nThe senator asked Garland whether U.S. President Joe Biden had told him his son is innocent.\n\n“Absolutely not,” Garland responded. “He has not done that, and he has committed to not interfere in the investigation.”\n\nHagerty pressed further, asking Garland how the public could be confident there won’t be political interference in the investigation.\n\n“Because we put a Trump appointee in charge of the investigation,” Garland said, referring to Weiss. “And because you have me as attorney general, who’s committed to the independence of the DOJ from any influence from the White House.”\n\nHagerty then asked Garland whether the DOJ was considering assigning a special counsel to investigate Hunter Biden. Garland again declined to comment.\n\nWhen asked under what circumstances a special counsel would be used in the investigation, Garland said, “it depends on the circumstances.”\n\nBraun asked similar questions about a potential special counsel and received similar responses.\n\n“The question is an internal DOJ matter,” Garland repeated. “I don’t want to make judgments, but I’m comfortable with the Attorney from Delaware continuing.”\n\nThe federal investigation into Hunter Biden’s finances was revealed in December 2020, and few updates have been provided since then.\n\nAttorney Clint Lancaster, who represented an Arkansas woman who filed the lawsuit in 2019 alleging that Hunter Biden was the father of her daughter Navy Joan Roberts, told CBS News earlier this month that federal prosecutors subpoenaed the documents from his case.\n\n“They wanted every record relating to Hunter Biden we had,” he said of the paternity case, which was settled in 2020.\n\nLancaster said the records included Hunter Biden’s “affidavit of financial means” during the paternity lawsuit. A financial affidavit is generally a statement showing income, expenses, assets, and liabilities.\n\nAdditionally, he said the tax records he and Roberts provided overlapped during the same time period as Hunter Biden’s foreign business activities.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/1.tagreuters.com2022binary_LYNXNPEI3510J-FILEDIMAGE-1200x833.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:47'}

Bill Hagerty (R-TN) asked Garland if he knew of the probe into the president’s son. Garland refused to reveal any internal deliberations against Hunter but noted the investigation is being run by David Weiss, a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nWeiss, a 20-year federal prosecutor, will have to determine if there is enough evidence to seek a federal grand jury indictment against Hunter Biden in an investigation that may end up including other members of the Biden family, such as Joe Biden’s brother James Biden, and potentially the president himself.\n\n“I’m aware of that, but he reports to you,” Hagerty pressed about the investigation under Weiss.\n\n“He is supervising the investigation and I’m not at liberty to talk about internal Justice Department deliberations, but he is in charge of that investigation,” Garland reiterated.\n\nGarland then promised the Biden administration would not interfere in the investigation. “There will not be interference of any political or improper kind.”\n\nHagerty continued his line of questioning by asking if Joe Biden ever told Garland that Hunter did not break any laws, including tax fraud, money laundering, and violation of lobbying laws.\n\n“Absolutely not. And the President has not done that. And the President is committed not to interfere, not only in that investigation but any other kind of investigation,” Garland claimed.\n\nLater in the hearing, Garland refused to say whether a special counsel should be placed over the investigation to maintain a just investigation. A special counsel would provide a degree of separation between Biden’s administration and the investigation. Legal experts have said a special counsel is necessary because Joe Biden has denied any wrongdoing by Hunter and may have influenced the ongoing investigation.\n\n“The question of whether they have a special counsel is one that is an internal decision-making within the department, so I don’t want to make any judgments one way or the other,” Garland responded. “But I’m quite comfortable with the United States attorney for that district continuing in the role that he’s [Weiss] playing.”\n\nDuring the 2020 presidential debate, Joe Biden claimed Hunter’s “laptop from hell” was a Russian plant “and a smear campaign.” Joe Biden has repeatedly claimed he was never involved in the family business.\n\nJoe Biden said the emails on Hunter’s laptop were a “Russian plant” and “a smear campaign.” Today new emails indicate that Biden was PAYING Hunter’s bills for a deal with a Chinese government-controlled entity. pic.twitter.com/K3Ojf3SyIg — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) April 26, 2022\n\nBut according to White House visitor logs obtained by the New York Post on Saturday, Hunter’s corrupt business partner, Eric Schwerin, met with Joe Biden at the White House 19 times between 2009 and 2015. Joe Biden was vice president during this time. The contact between Joe Biden and Schwerin directly contradicts Joe Biden’s repeated claims he was never involved in the family business.

Sixty percent say Hunter Biden has sold “influence and access” to Joe Biden. The poll also shows 67 percent believe Joe Biden should be impeached if he “secretly participated and facilitated” in the family’s business.\n\nText messages from 2019 on Hunter’s “laptop from hell” depict the Biden family payout mechanism.

But don’t worry, unlike Pop [Joe], I won’t make you give me half your salary.”\n\nThe Biden’s family payment mechanism of collecting 50 percent of family salaries for 30 years could be legal “predicates” for racketeering charges, according to former Utah U.S. attorney Brett Tolman.\n\nFollow Wendell Husebø on Twitter and Gettr @WendellHusebø.

A Trump-appointed federal judge in Louisiana said he planned to block the administration’s plans for rescinding the public health order, a win for a group of GOP-led states who sued to stop Biden from moving forward.\n\nThe meeting punctuated internal disagreement in the Democratic Party around the Biden administration’s decision to end enforcement of the Title 42 authority, a public health order that allows border officials to speedily turn away migrants at the U.S. southern border.\n\nImmigration advocates have a litany of concerns about the policy, but at the center of those issues is that it allows officials to forego asylum screenings, blocking persecuted migrants from exercising a right they have under U.S. law.\n\nWhile many support the Biden administration’s decision and indeed wish it had come sooner, others have expressed concern about the plans amid a prolonged spike in border crossings.\n\n“Yes they’re listening to the immigration activists, but my question is who’s listening to the men and women in green and in blue and, more importantly, who is listening to the border communities – the sheriffs, the landowners, the rest of the people who live on the border?” Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), who represents a border community and has raised concerns about the policy decision, said on “Fox News Sunday.”\n\nRep. Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.), who was tasked with presenting the group’s position on Title 42 to Biden, said the meeting touched on a series of issues before turning to immigration, an issue that still led coverage of the meeting.\n\n“The reality is when you talk to Latinos they’re talking about the economy, jobs, air pollution, and so the media is talking about things that are divisive,” said Barragán.\n\nBarragán added that the CHC puts more blame over the immigration policy crisis on former President Trump than on Biden.\n\n“The bottom line is this president walked into a tough situation with a prior administration who dismantled the legal immigration system,” she said.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the meeting was part of Biden’s outreach to individual congressional caucuses. Biden has recently met with the Congressional Progressive Caucus as well as other groups in Congress.\n\nAttendees said that it also covered the implementation of the bipartisan infrastructure law, immigration reform, and environmental justice.\n\nAt one point, an aide to the president walked into the room with a note saying the 30-minute meeting had gone on for 62 minutes.\n\nBiden, rather than keep the information to himself, read the note out loud to laughter from the attendees.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House is facing pressure from immigration advocates to forcefully oppose a bill that has attracted support from moderate senators that would delay an end to the enforcement of Title 42. The White House has not taken a position on the legislation.\n\n“I just wish that the Biden administration would stand up and explain what it’s doing and own it,” said Clara Long, associate director at Human Rights Watch who focuses on immigration and border policy.\n\nPsaki again on Monday said it would be up to Congress to make any changes to CDC’s Title 42 enforcement, but she declined to say whether Biden would sign legislation that did so.\n\n“This would be Congress having the discussion. We are continuing to prepare for a May 23 implementation,” Psaki said. “There will be a range of conversations about this over the coming days.”\n\nThe lawsuits filed by GOP-led states seem to be the biggest immediate threat to the administration’s plans. Some have speculated that the White House would like to see the courts thwart their plans in order to take a hot-button political issue off Biden’s plate.\n\n“I think there’s a theory going around that they’re hoping the courts give them a get-out-of-jail-free card,” said Long.\n\nBiden’s approval ratings are particularly low on his handling of immigration.\n\nA Politico/Morning Consult poll conducted earlier this month found that 54 percent of registered voters oppose Biden’s decision to lift Title 42.\n\nBut a different poll conducted in February by Impact Research for the National Immigration Law Center found that 52 percent of likely 2022 voters support ending Title 42 enforcement.\n\nStill, most CHC members believe that the administration can push forward with its vision of border policy, because Republicans are unlikely to relent from attacking Biden on immigration and the border.\n\n“No matter what the president does, they’re going to make noise. The president and the Democratic-controlled Congress have done amazing things, that’s why econ has improved,” said Rep. Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.), who attended the meeting.\n\n“Republicans don’t want to focus on the glass that’s half full, they want to convince us the glass is half empty,” he added.\n\nSome advocates for ending the policy, which they say represented one prong of the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant agenda, argue that Democrats are risking turning off their base by voicing support for continuing the policy.\n\n“This is a policy that can help you win and the flipside of that is embracing the Republican talking points is not going to help you win those Democratic voters that you desperately need to turn out for you in November,” said Bri Gillis, political director of the National Immigration Law Center’s Immigrant Justice Fund.\n\nStill, some Democrats say the discussion of Title 42 is moot.\n\n“There’s nothing to debate, you’re either for Title 42 or you’re not,” said Rep. Lou Correa (D-Calif.), a CHC member who did not attend the meeting.\n\n“Everybody’s talking abt Title 42 when that’s not the issue. The real issue is American industrial might, nearshoring of American jobs from China, creating a stronger manufacturing base, and a lot of that relies on immigrants. And we’re talking about Title 42. Doesn’t even come close to addressing the bigger public policy issues in this country and that’s what everybody’s talking about. And it’s hurting us,” said Correa.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/ruizraul_031821gn_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:41'}

They stole this election. We all know. They will destroy our country next.”\n\nThe message about Trump potentially invoking martial law, earlier reported by CNN on Monday and confirmed by the Guardian, came a month after the idea had been raised in a heated Oval Office meeting a month before, where Trump considered ways to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nMeadows did not appear to respond to Greene’s text. But the messages Trump’s top White House aide was receiving shows the extraordinary ideas swirling around Trump after he and his operatives were unable to stop the certification of Biden’s election win on January 6.\n\nGreene – one of Trump’s fiercest far-right defenders on Capitol Hill – also texted Meadows days before the Capitol attack asking about how to prepare for objections to Biden’s win at the joint session of Congress, the text messages show.\n\n“Good morning Mark, I’m here in DC. We have to get organized for the 6th,” Greene wrote on 31 December. “I would like to meet with Rudy Giuliani again. We didn’t get to speak with him long. Also anyone who can help. We are getting a lot of members on board.”\n\nThat text message from Greene, who had not yet been sworn in as a member of Congress, a week before the Capitol attack also underscores her close relationship with the Trump White House and an extraordinary level of coordination to obstruct Biden being certified as president.\n\nBut the text messages that Meadows did not turn over to the select committee – as opposed to the communications he agreed to produce for the investigation – were perhaps more notable as the panel investigates connections between the White House and the Capitol attack.\n\nThe panel is aware, for instance, that Meadows had contacts through December 2020 and January 2021 with organizers of the Save America rally at the Ellipse that descended into the Capitol attack as well as with Trump campaign officials, say sources close to the inquiry.\n\nYet none of the text messages Meadows produced to the select committee through a cooperation deal agreed last year and in response to a subpoena show any such contacts, raising the specter that he might have deliberately withheld some communications.\n\nThe former White House chief of staff appears to have ultimately turned over no text messages between 9 December and 21 December, a critical time period in the lead-up to the Capitol attack during which a number of key moments took place.\n\nMeadows appeared to be aware of efforts by the White House and others, for instance, to send fake Trump slates of electors to Congress. The idea was to have “dueling” slates of electors force then-vice president Mike Pence to discount those votes and return Trump to office.\n\nThat scheme – which the select committee believes was coordinated in part by the Trump White House, the sources said – appeared to occur on 14 December, the deadline under the Electoral Count Act for states to send electoral college votes to Congress.\n\nMeadows also was in close contact with Trump’s attorney Rudy Giuliani and others after the contentious Oval Office meeting with Trump on 18 December, as he sought to bar onetime Trump campaign lawyer and conspiracy theorist Sidney Powell from the White House.\n\nBut Meadows appears to have turned over no text messages from that crucial period, as allies of the former president started to set their sights on January 6, including the Stop the Steal movement that started to plan a protest at the Capitol around that time.\n\nThe seeming omission may be explained in part by the fact that Meadows was communicating about those plans on his personal cell phone – against which the select committee issued a subpoena contested by Meadows in federal court as “overly broad”.\n\nThe absence of messages between 9 December and 21 December may also be explained more straightforwardly by the fact that Meadows did not receive any messages during that period. Meadows’ lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nHouse investigators are not convinced they have been given all the text messages relevant to their subpoena, according to one source with knowledge of the matter, and expect to continue pursuing Meadows’ documents and personal communications in court.\n\nIn a motion for summary judgment with respect to Meadows’ records, the select committee said in a 248-page court filing late on Friday that it believed Meadows’ claims for withholding material from the investigation on grounds of executive privilege were baseless.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfe079c4faec28229651078fa1ef1445f13623c9/0_149_4504_2704/master/4504.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bb0615f20d2d295d9c507d24a68b0912', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:54'}

After that test came back positive, Allen said, Harris took a PCR test, a more accurate assessment that confirmed the rapid result. Harris left the White House for her residence at the U.S. Naval Observatory by motorcade.\n\nBiden and Harris later spoke by phone. “He wanted to check in and make sure she has everything she needs as she quarantines at home,” the White House said in a statement.\n\nThough Harris did not attend any formal meetings, the White House is still tracing her contacts to determine who may have been exposed to her.

The White House rhetoric has shifted from preventing infections to promoting vaccines, boosters and therapeutics.\n\n“It is going to be hard to ensure that no one gets COVID in America,” Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House’s coronavirus coordinator, told reporters Tuesday. “That’s not even a policy. The goal of our policy should be obviously to minimize infections whenever possible, but to make sure people don’t get seriously ill. The best ways of doing that are make sure people are vaccinated and boosted as the vice president is and making sure we have plenty of therapeutics.”\n\nMinutes after Harris announced her result, two Democratic members of the Senate — Ron Wyden of Oregon and Chris Murphy of Connecticut — announced they too had contracted what they believed to be mild forms of the virus.\n\n“It’s a bummer, but I’m sure if I wasn’t fully vaccinated I would be feeling a lot worse. So remember to get your booster!” Murphy tweeted.\n\nSimmons, Harris’ communications director, tested positive for the virus after attending the April 2 Gridiron dinner, a traditional white-tie gathering of reporters and politicians that features light roasts and songs.\n\nAtty. Gen. Merrick Garland and Gina Raimondo, the secretary of Commerce, announced positive test results following the dinner, as did Reps. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank) and Joaquin Castro (D-Texas).\n\nAll of them had been vaccinated, and none became seriously ill.\n\nHarris’ positive tests come as the administration has tried to push the country toward normalcy, eliminating mask requirements in many settings and returning to public gatherings. A federal judge in Florida took it a step further last week, overturning a federal requirement to wear masks on airplanes, trains and buses. The administration is appealing that ruling.\n\n“None of us can predict with any certainty where exactly this pandemic is going, what the virus is going to do next.

The goal of our policy should be, obviously minimize infection whenever possible but to make sure people don’t get seriously ill,” he said.\n\nHarris’s husband, Doug Emhoff, became the first member of the first and second couples to contract COVID-19. He tested positive on March 15, which lead to a flurry of questions over Harris’s contact and if she should be wearing a mask around the president and others. She continued to test negative during Emhoff’s stint with the coronavirus.\n\nTwo Democratic senators also tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday: Chris Murphy (Conn.) and Ron Wyden (Ore.).\n\nEarlier this month, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) had the coronavirus, as did Attorney General Merrick Garland.\n\nThe White House recently first acknowledged that Biden could get COVID-19 amid the uptick in positive cases surrounding the president earlier this month.\n\n“I wouldn’t say it’s just a matter of time, but I of course it is possible that the president, like every other American, could get COVID,” Jha said on Tuesday. “There is no 100 percent anything.”\n\nPsaki was asked to respond to a hypothetical question about the line of succession if Biden were to also get COVID-19 and both he and Harris become “very ill.”\n\n“Well, technically the Speaker of the House is the third in line. So, there you go. No, I’m just confirming that for you. It is true, as we’ve noted many times, it is possible the president could test positive. We will be very transparent with you if that were to happen,” Psaki said.\n\nShe added though that she thinks Biden would be able to continue his presidential duties if he were to test positive.\n\n“He has access to the best health care in the world, and we believe, because of all the precautions and steps we have taken that he would be able to continue his duties, as the vice president is as well as vice president,” she said.\n\nOfficials stress that he is vaccinated, and Psaki said last week last week that it wouldn’t be a failure of the precautions in place to protect Biden if he were to get the virus.\n\nPsaki on Tuesday told reporters not to expect updates to protocols, including masking protocols, within the White House in light of Harris’ positive test.\n\nShe noted there is a regular testing cadence for the president and vice president, as well as officials around them, and that there is social distancing in meetings and a number of aides choose to wear masks.\n\nUpdated at 4:09 p.m.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/harriskamala_031522_ap_manuel_balce_ceneta.jpeg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:41'}

Kyrsten Sinema has confounded Democrats over budget talks – even while boasting about using her cleavage to reel in 'uptight' Republicans, according to a new book.\n\nSinema, a weight-lifter and fitness buff, regularly draws attention in the buttoned-down Senate hallways with her eclectic fashion choices.\n\nBut she has also developed ways to contend with Republicans in the minority, according to This Will Not Pass, a new book by New York Times reporters Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns.\n\nDespite being more 'discomfiting' to the White House than any Democrat in the 50-50 Senate, Sinema had relationships across the political aisle. The former House member, who is the first bisexual member of the Senate, 'joked with Democrats about how easy it was for her to charm Republican men,' according to the book.\n\n'Sinema, a fitness enthusiast who was 36 when she entered Congress, boasted knowingly to colleagues and aides that her cleavage had an extraordinary persuasive effect on the uptight men of the GOP. She told one House Republican that while she would never switch parties, her father would be delighted if she did,' the authors write.\n\nSen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) 'boasted knowingly to colleagues and aides that her cleavage had an extraordinary persuasive effect on the uptight men of the GOP,' according to a new book\n\nThe book also delves into President Joe Biden's governing woes – including prolonged talks with Sinema, whom the authors dub an 'aloof Arizonan.' She became a progressive nemesis when she and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) wouldn't go along with Biden's multi-trillion proposals, although she did cheer his infrastructure plan.\n\nAfter Biden signed the infrastructure bill, Sinema asked Biden's aides not to send the president to her home state for a 'victory lap,' even though he had won Arizona in 2020. White House aides were concluding she was 'simply a difficult person.'\n\nThe book describes one early 2021 dinner with Senate Republicans after the election where where the Republicans asked Sinema to join – and she requested to be able to enter through a back door to avoid being seen.\n\nShe has won praise from Republicans for her opposition to changing the Senate filibuster, and a line of Republicans congratulated her on the Senate floor after voting with the GOP on a move to advance the Democratic leadership backed voting rights legislation.\n\nThe book, which grabbed headlines with revelations about House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, also contains details about former President Donald Trump and his election overturn effort.\n\nSinema confounded Democrats during months-long negotiations\n\nSinema previously served in the House. Here, she and Trey Hollingsworth, R-Ind., talk before a House Financial Services Committee hearing in 2018\n\nSinema asked Biden's aides not to send the president to her home state for a 'victory lap' after Biden signed the infrastructure bill, according to the book\n\nTrump's belief that he could prevail extended well after the time he left the White House and decamped to Mar-a-Lago.\n\nAnd it wasn't just Donald Trump's most passionate adherents who believed in the 'reinstatement' myth – the former President himself was saying last spring he would be reinstalled within months, the book reveals.\n\nTrump stated his belief in the theory in May of 2021, four months after leaving office, according to the book.\n\nThe idea of a Trump reinstatement was being promoted at the time by My Pillow exec Mike Lindell and QAnon adherents, although it would ultimately be believed by nearly a third of Republicans in a June Politico / Morning Consult survey.\n\nTrump phoned National Review editor Rich Lowry to tell him that the magazine 'would take off like a rocket if it recognized that he had actually won the election,' according to the book.\n\n'In fact, Trump told Lowry, he expected to be reinstated by August, and Republicans would be put back in charge of the Senate once the supposedly pervasive corruption of the 2020 election was exposed.'\n\nFormer President Donald Trump told columnist Rich Lowry in May 2021 he expected to be reinstated within months, according to a new book\n\nThe Senate had flipped to Democratic control in 2000 after two Democratic wins in Georgia.\n\nThere is no provision in the Constitution for 'reinstatement' once election results have been certified by the states and Congress has counted the electoral votes and the president and lawmakers have been sworn into office.\n\n(Lowry may have been an odd target for Trump's lobbying. He had called the Capitol riot in a Jan. 6th column a 'disgrace,' where he wrote that 'one point of the riot was to further pressure Pence (“Hang Mike Pence!”), but much of the lobbying took place behind closed doors, among Trump’s advisers.')\n\nTrump also took a shot at now Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. 'It was beyond belief, Trump said, that Mitch McConnell did not seem to understand this,' according to the book.\n\n'The president's comments were pure madness,' the authors write.\n\nCongress ultimately counted the votes certified by the states following the Capitol riot. Joe Biden took the oath Jan. 20th after Trump left the White House\n\nTrump has been spending time at Mar-a-Lago and holding rallies around the country while dangling the possibility of a return to the White House\n\nThere have been multiple reports on Trump's interest in getting 'reinstated.'\n\nAfter Trump withdrew his endorsement of Alabama GOP Rep. Mo Brooks, Brooks released a statement saying Trump had approached him with the idea.\n\n'President Trump asked me to rescind the 2020 elections, immediately remove Joe Biden from the White House, immediately put President Trump back in the White House, and hold a new special election for the presidency,' Brooks said in a statement.\n\n'As a lawyer, I’ve repeatedly advised President Trump that January 6 was the final election contest verdict and neither the U.S. Constitution nor the U.S. Code permit what President Trump asks. Period,' he added.\n\n'I’ve told President Trump the truth knowing full well that it might cause President Trump to rescind his endorsement. But I took a sworn oath to defend and protect the U.S. Constitution. I honor my oath. That is the way I am. I break my sworn oath for no man.'\n\nTrump took back his endorsement in the Alabama Senate primary, citing Brooks' call for people to put the 2020 election 'behind you.'\n\nLindell, who was advised Trump inside the White House in the last days of his presidency, has also repeatedly touted the idea.\n\nOther passages in the book reveal how Vice President Kamala Harris quickly learned not to come between President Biden and his negotiations with Congress.\n\nThe authors recount one episode where the president snapped at her so harshly even Republican senators in the meeting were shocked.\n\nIn a meeting last May, Biden tried to persuade Republican lawmakers to support $1 trillion in infrastructure spending.\n\nAnd while Biden was ready for a compromise, Harris thought the bill was skimpy.\n\n'Harris thought that there was something missing from the conversation,' according to the book.\n\nShe began turning the conversation toward Democratic priorities, including family and social spending, which were originally included in the larger Build Back Better bill.\n\nShe 'began to make the case for a larger package than the one Republicans seemed to have in mind.'\n\n'Biden dismissed her comment immediately,' the authors wrote, in so harsh a tone 'that even the Republican senators were taken aback.'\n\nBiden was typically 'scrupulously respectful' of his second-in-command, but the moment revealed that infrastructure negotiations were his and his alone.", 'image': 'https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/26/17/57074033-0-image-a-35_1650989503049.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:57:00'}

After news of Musk’s takeover, news website Politico contacted several top Republican members and aides to gauge reaction to a potential Trump Twitter return.\n\n“Every single one of them told us that they hoped the former president stays the hell away from Twitter,” Politico reported.\n\nTrump himself has said he won’t be back, telling Fox News: “I am going to be staying on Truth.”\n\nThe twice-impeached former commander-in-chief is not known for his consistency, however. He has reportedly expressed discontent with how Truth Social has performed – “What the fuck is going on,” the Daily Beast reported Trump as asking aides in March – and to return to relevance, and to win back the spotlight he craves, the former president might need Twitter.\n\n“If he wants to intervene on behalf of a candidate he has now endorsed in the midterm elections, being able to reach that number of people with messages supporting those candidates is a way of essentially getting free advertising time to reach people who are more likely to vote as a result of getting a signal from Donald Trump,” Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, told Time.\n\nTrump may have insisted that he will snub Twitter and stick with Truth Social, but his commitment to his own platform has so far been tepid at best – Trump has posted on Truth Social just once.\n\nIf that lack of interaction hasn’t helped Truth Social, neither did the botched rollout on 21 February. Tens of thousands of people were unable to access the network – the Guardian was finally allowed in on 5 March – and by early April the Truth Social app was the 355th most popular on Apple devices.\n\nIn terms of daily active users, Truth Social had 513,000, the Daily Beast reported. Twitter has about 217 million.\n\nLack of usage – both by Trump and by the general public – is not the only problem the new network faces.\n\nShares in Digital World Acquisition Corporation, the firm which plans to merge with Trump Media & Technology Group, dropped 13% on Monday after news of Musk’s deal. Since Musk became the largest shareholder in Twitter TMTG shares have fallen by 44% overall, and two key Truth Social executives quit the platform in April.\n\nSince Trump was removed from Twitter his missives have been limited to email blasts sent from his Save America Pac, the messages frequently bleating about a “stolen election” in 2020. At the moment those emails are received by a mixture of supporters and vaguely interested journalists.\n\nIf Trump resumed tweeting, he’d have a far bigger audience for his misinformation – which could have serious consequences.\n\n“The real danger would come after election day,” Gertz said, “when he could use that same megaphone to spread lies about voter fraud as a pretext for overturning elections. If that happens, another January 6 – perhaps a more successful one – is very much in play.”', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a92109698abfe8cebc8ed79f918f6e0cb5a652cf/0_156_5131_3078/master/5131.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0c9734ab4bdc644afa8fecabe2eaf914', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:03'}

But obviously in the case where there’s perhaps a lot of controversy, you would not necessarily want to promote that tweet,” he said.\n\nPreviously, Musk has expressed alarm over Twitter’s content moderation policies, suggesting they’re tantamount to political censorship.\n\nIn recent years, Twitter has fielded criticism from conservatives and others who have said the company has engaged in censoring viewpoints that go against the mainstream.\n\nNotably, former President Donald Trump was suspended from the social media site after the Jan. 6 Capitol breach, coming as Twitter spokespeople claimed he was using the platform to incite violence, although it did not provide evidence for its claims.

Those measures aim to make the services more appealing to advertisers seeking a safe venue, and to better accommodate politicians and regulators arguing that the platforms are responsible for all of their content. But the moves have alienated some users who, like Mr. Musk, say they go overboard.\n\nHow Twitter operates won’t be entirely up to Mr. Musk.\n\n“Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules—regardless of their shareholding,” Thierry Breton, the EU regulator, wrote Tuesday on Twitter. “Mr Musk knows this well.”\n\nMr. Breton expressed confidence that Twitter, under Mr. Musk’s ownership, would conform to the bloc’s new rules, which still need formal approval from the EU Parliament and representatives from EU countries.\n\nMr. Musk’s planned changes at Twitter, and the response, will be closely watched. Twitter is smaller and less profitable than other social-media companies. It claims 217 million so-called monetizable daily users compared with 1.9 billion daily users for Meta Platforms Inc.’s core Facebook platform and a billion-plus monthly users for TikTok. But Twitter users include media personalities, politicians, activists and tech aficionados who help shape social discourse.\n\n“It has influence way beyond its user base and way beyond its valuation, and so we care about it,” said David Kaye, former United Nations special rapporteur focused on free speech and now a law professor at the University of California, Irvine.\n\nTwitter’s existing content policies haven’t brought about huge financial success; it has struggled to deliver consistent profits. Photo: Laura Morton for The Wall Street Journal\n\nMr. Musk, chief executive of Tesla Inc. and Space Exploration Technologies Corp. as well as the world’s richest person, is one of Twitter’s most prominent users, employing the platform for everything from promoting his companies to battling rivals and critics. In Monday’s deal announcement, he said he wants to open up Twitter’s algorithms to public scrutiny, “defeat” spammers and authenticate users’ identities.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Musk said he views “free speech” as that permitted by the law—a far broader definition of what is allowable than most major social networks have adopted. “I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law,” he said in a tweet. “If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect. Therefore, going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people.”\n\nSome industry executives and analysts say Mr. Musk is in for an awakening. Reversing Twitter’s efforts risks stoking advertisers’ worries about the placement of their ads, potentially pushing them toward competitors like Snap Inc. and Meta, said Ben Black, co-head of internet research at Deutsche Bank.\n\nElon Musk struck a deal on Monday to buy Twitter for about $44 billion, moving the world’s richest man a step closer to taking control of the social-media platform. Photo: Ryan Lash/TED Conferences, LLC/AFP via Getty Images\n\n“Do you really want to have your Mercedes-Benz commercial against a beheading?” he said. “If someone falls overboard on a cruise ship, do you want your vacation message being advertised against that content?” He said less moderation could also drive away some users, potentially slowing growth.\n\n“‘Do you really want to have your Mercedes-Benz commercial against a beheading?’” — Ben Black, co-head of internet research at Deutsche Bank\n\nIn the company’s early years, Twitter executives were loath to remove content unless it broke local laws. The platform often took a hands-off approach even to content from officially designated terrorist groups, drawing criticism from researchers, lawmakers and victims’ families.\n\nIt stepped up moderation over the years, removing accounts connected to the terrorist group ISIS in 2014, for example. That accelerated during and after the 2016 U.S. presidential race, which saw a jump in complaints about white nationalists and others using the platform to attack and harass minority users.\n\nOther industry leaders who favored looser policies, including Meta co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, have gradually embraced more intervention. Platforms including Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest Inc. and Reddit Inc. all have added staff or bolstered rules to monitor their content, though each draws the lines differently.\n\nTheir efforts target a range of potentially problematic content, from hate speech and false information about elections to what they see as fringe views on health, along with other issues the platforms consider harmful. Pinterest recently banned posts that it deems to contain misinformation about climate change.\n\nTwitter and other platforms also have systems allowing users to report claims of abuse by other users, which can lead to account suspensions that some of those involved say can be arbitrary or unfair.\n\nMore moderating has required complex, and often confusing, guidelines for employees and users. Such efforts have led to some divisive decisions, including bans by Twitter and Facebook of then-President Donald Trump for posts encouraging the rioters who attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, seeking to halt certification of President Biden’s electoral victory.\n\nThose bans were widely praised on the left and by some Republicans. But Mr. Trump and his supporters blasted it and have backed rival social-media apps with fewer restrictions that so far have gained limited traction, including Parler, Gab, and Gettr, which former Trump adviser Jason Miller launched last year.\n\nMany in the Trump camp have voiced support for Mr. Musk’s planned Twitter acquisition, though Mr. Trump told Fox News on Monday that he doesn’t plan to return to the platform and would instead use his social-media startup, Truth Social.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up Technology A weekly digest of tech reviews, headlines, columns and your questions answered by WSJ's Personal Tech gurus. PREVIEW\n\nDevin Nunes, CEO of Truth Social, lauded Monday’s Twitter deal, though he said he doesn’t see the platform, even under Mr. Musk, as a direct competitor because of their different target audiences. “This is a great, great day,” the Trump ally and former GOP congressman said. “Finally we’re getting some movement in the right direction here in terms of opening the internet back up and giving people their voice back.”\n\nTwitter’s existing policies haven’t brought about huge financial success; it has struggled to deliver consistent profits. And losing advertisers might not be a problem for Mr. Musk. He has said he wants the platform to rely less on advertising—which accounts for about 90% of its revenue, totaling $5.1 billion last year—and to focus more on a subscription business model. The platform currently offers Twitter Blue, a $2.99-a-month subscription service that gives customers access to premium features.\n\nDespite Mr. Trump’s comments Monday, many observers and Twitter employees are focused on Mr. Musk’s handling of the former president’s account as a potential indicator of his plans. During an all-hands meeting on Monday, Twitter CEO Parag Agarwal was asked if the company might reinstate Mr. Trump once Mr. Musk’s ownership is completed. Mr. Agarwal said it wasn’t clear.\n\n—Patience Haggin contributed to this article.\n\nElon Musk and Twitter More coverage of the billionaire's bid for Twitter, selected by editors Latest Developments\n\nWrite to Deepa Seetharaman at Deepa.Seetharaman@wsj.com and Meghan Bobrowsky at Meghan.Bobrowsky@wsj.com", 'image': 'https://images.wsj.net/im-531039/social', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:07'}

Given that neither received any Republican support during earlier procedural votes, the latest Covid absences scrambled the equation for Democrats.', 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/26/us/politics/26dc-harris/merlin_205209216_8283ca17-da2a-4f0a-a956-b00adce3f8b1-facebookJumbo.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:59'}

He said that the book describes how “populist economic nationalism has arrived as a movement and why we need to embrace it.”\n\nIn 2021, Navarro published the book “In Trump Time: A Journal of America’s Plague Year,” which was ranked as a top-10 bestseller by USA Today and has been a bestseller on Amazon. Navarro previously noted that more than 200,000 copies of “In Trump Time” had been pre-sold, according to distributors, before it was available to the public.\n\nHowever, “In Trump Time” was omitted from The New York Times’ non-fiction bestseller list even though it should have been ranked at least third on the list from Nov. 21, 2021, Navarro said at the time, citing statistics published by Bookscan, the definitive industry source used for book rankings.\n\n“The New York Times in its cancel culture, virtue signaling, fascist world, did not put it on the list,” Navarro told The Epoch Times. “And that had a material harm to the sales of the book because people use that New York Times bestseller list as what we call in economics a ‘signal’ as to whether a book is worthy of purchase. So there was a great grassroots performance by the book itself. But my judgment, if we weren’t in a cancel culture world, we probably would have sold a million copies of that book.”\n\nIn response to Navarro’s allegations, Nicole Taylor, a communications director at The New York Times, told The Epoch Times in an email that the publication’s best-seller lists are “based on a detailed analysis of book sales from a wide range of retailers who provide us with specific and confidential context of their sales each week.”\n\nThe New York Times representative added that “sales data from our confidential panel of reporting stores is separate from what is reported to Bookscan or other entities” and that publication’s “Best Sellers department has reviewed the data they received for the sales week of November 21, 2021 and is confident in the accuracy of the Best-Seller Lists for that week.”\n\nNavarro, in an email response, called The New York Times’ statement a “misdirection,” saying that “In Trump Time” sold over 30,000 books during the week in question. “We sold twice as many books or more as half of the titles that appeared on the list,” he said.\n\nThe former official announced “Taking Back Trump’s America,” which is scheduled for release in September, while guest-hosting Stephen K. Bannon’s “War Room” podcast on April 15, and said “hands down the ‘War Room’ is the most powerful platform to sell thoughtful books to the American public. It really astonishes people, authors, publishers, when they go on the road and see how lettered the audience is.”\n\n“I’m counting also on publications like The Epoch Times,” he said. “My hope is that avid readers of The Epoch Times will embrace ‘Taking Back Trump’s America.’”\n\nNavarro revealed that The Epoch Times will be included in the book, saying, “I talk about The Epoch Times in glowing terms in the ‘Taking Back Trump’s America’ book with respect to how it’s grown rapidly from what was a niche publication to one of the most important international newspapers in the world.”\n\nThe former official projected large gains for the Republicans in November’s midterms, driven by growing dissatisfaction with what he described as increasingly radical Democratic policies.\n\n“I think a safe bet is a 60-seat swing [in favor of the Republican Party], which is similar to what happened to Obama with the Tea Party [movement] and when [Newt] Gingrich came along [in the 1994 midterm elections], but depending on how redistricting goes around the country, that could go as high as 80 and as low as 30 or 40,” Navarro said.\n\n“I think a large portion of the country now is united against the Democrat Party,” he added, describing its performance as showing that “it’s a radical political party.”\n\n“It’s really out of touch in the center of this country.”\n\nDespite Republican Party advantages heading into the midterms, Navarro noted that there are struggles between globalists and nationalists happening within the party.\n\n“It’s also true that there’s an important war going on now within the Republican Party between the party of Davos, Wall Street, multinational corporations that offshore our jobs versus the Trump Republicans who embrace secure borders, embrace fair rather than simply so-called free trade,” he said. “If we simply have a Republican majority with the current leadership in charge, Mitch McConnell in the Senate, Kevin McCarthy in the House, we’re going to have basically the status quo ante, and it will not serve the center of this country.”\n\nNavarro emphasized the distinction between “RINO,” an acronym for “Republican in Name Only,” and “Trump” Republicans.\n\n“The Karl Rove faction, the Wall Street faction, the Liz Cheney faction … Mitch McConnell, [Kevin] McCarthy, they’re all supporting RINO Republicans rather than Trump Republicans,” he said, adding that the Republican primaries will serve as a critical test to determine which camp prevails.\n\nA primary race that Navarro is particularly interested in is the Republican primary race in South Carolina’s 1st Congressional District between Trump-endorsed Katie Arrington and first-term incumbent Nancy Mace. Following the events of Jan. 6, 2021, and in what was her first speech on the floor of the House of Representatives, Mace, who had worked on the 2016 Trump campaign, blamed the president for the breach of the Capitol. A story was also posted to her official Congressional website that included “Mace Condemns President Trump” in the headline.\n\nMace is a poster child for the RINO, Rove, corporate media effort to stop the Trump movement,” Navarro told The Epoch Times. Trump endorsed primary challenger Katie Arrington in February, calling Mace “an absolutely terrible candidate” who “has been very disloyal to the Republican Party.”\n\nWhen reached for comment, Austin McCubbin, manager for Rep. Mace’s congressional campaign wrote in an e-mailed statement, “Conservative organizations all score Mace as having a near perfect voting record, because she doesn’t sacrifice her principles.”\n\nNavarro, in response, said in an email, “I was in the trenches with Katie Arrington in the Trump administration when we were fighting to save millions of lives at the start of the pandemic and she was a warrior.”\n\n“The only thing you need to know about Mace is she supported the Democrats effort to steal the election from Donald Trump,” he added.\n\nExecutive Privilege\n\nNavarro described how he is protecting executive privilege in the face of intense pressure from the Democrat-majority House committee investigating the events of Jan. 6.\n\nThe Trump aide refused to comply with a subpoena from the House committee, citing executive privilege. In a highly partisan vote this month, the House of Representatives voted to formally ask the Justice Department to prosecute Navarro and another top Trump adviser on criminal contempt charges for not complying with the subpoena.\n\nAfter the November 2020 presidential election when Trump and allies, including Navarro, alleged largescale election irregularities and fraud, Navarro coordinated what he calls the “Green Bay Sweep” strategy with Trump and Stephen Bannon, who previously served as Trump’s chief White House strategist. The Green Bay Sweep Strategy, named after a football play made famous by the Green Bay Packers, involved members of Congress formally contesting election results in six battleground states before the certification of presidential election results on Jan. 6.\n\nNavarro writes in his book “In Trump Time” regarding Jan. 6, “The political and legal beauty of the strategy was this: by law, both the House of Representatives and the Senate must spend up to two hours of debate per state on each requested challenge. For the six battleground states, that would add up to as much as twenty-four hours of nationally televised hearings across the two chambers of Congress. Through these televised proceedings, we would finally be able to short-circuit the crushing censorship of the anti-Trump media and take our case directly to the American people.”\n\nHe also writes of the event, “The goal is not to get the election overturned today. The goal is to subject the ballots—the legal votes of American citizens along with what we believe to be a flood of illegal ballots—to careful scrutiny and investigation.”\n\nNavarro explained his reasons for maintaining privilege during the House committee proceedings, and suggested that the matter may ultimately have to be resolved by the Supreme Court.\n\n“President Trump has asserted executive privilege, number one,” Navarro told The Epoch Times. “Number two, I informed the [House January 6] committee very clearly that it was not my privilege to waive, therefore I could not comply with their subpoena. And I directed them—and this is equally important—I directed them to negotiate directly with [Trump] and his attorneys for any partial or full waiver of the privilege, and then I would be happy to comply if President Trump himself or his attorneys negotiated something with them. It’s not my privilege to waive.”\n\nHe added, “Subsequent to that, the committee colluded either explicitly or tacitly with the Biden White House to do an end run around that direction, and they chose to have Biden take the legal step of waiving President Trump’s privilege in this matter. And that’s where things stand. So, there’s going to be ongoing legal activities related to that … But this is a Supreme Court decision waiting to happen, because the [House Jan. 6] committee itself is acting in an illegal manner.”\n\nThe White House and the House Jan. 6 committee did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nNavarro in late 2020 completed a report, “The Navarro Report,” documenting detailed evidence and statistical receipts of widespread election fraud and irregularities in the 2020 presidential election. He noted this report has never been discredited, despite Democrats and others maintaining that there was no election fraud.\n\n“The central premise of the Jan. 6 committee is that the election was fair. And they simply assert that there was no fraud or irregularities,” Navarro said. “The problem with that is that there is abundant evidence to the contrary, starting with a very extensive and extensively referenced three-volume report I did that explains what that fraud and what those irregularities were, and how and why the Democrats were able to pull off essentially what was a stolen election.”\n\nNavarro also pointed to corporate media turning a blind eye to the Navarro Report and the substantial evidence of fraud in the 2020 presidential election that it details.\n\n“Just as the corporate media ignored purposefully the “In Trump Time” book, which arguably is the best history to date of the Trump White House, they have ignored any reference to the three-volume Navarro Report … The report’s been out there well prior to January 6, and nobody has ever discredited it.”\n\nDefending Against China\n\nThe former official described the Biden administration’s handling of its relationship with the Chinese regime as “total appeasement.”\n\n“I’m very, very concerned that the weakness that Biden showed Putin has resulted in the invasion of Ukraine. The weakness that Biden is showing Xi Jinping may result in an invasion of Taiwan,” he said.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nNavarro, who has authored books including “The Coming China Wars,” “Death By China,” and “Crouching Tiger: What China’s Militarism Means for the World,” is known for his strong defense of the United States against totalitarian China’s aggression, and was one of the chief architects of the Trump administration’s tough trade policies with respect to Beijing. Trump slapped nearly $360 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods during his presidency.\n\nIn the Trump White House, Navarro identified the Chinese Communist Party’s “seven deadly sins” of economic aggression, including cyber hacking to steal trade secrets, intellectual property theft, forced technology transfer, below-cost dumping of products into American markets, the use of heavily subsidized state-owned enterprises that employ predatory pricing, currency manipulation, and the flooding of American communities with fentanyl and other opioids.\n\nWhen asked about what the United States should do now to continue to defend against totalitarian China’s aggression, Navarro stated, “We were ready in a second [Trump administration] term to really up the tariffs.”\n\nHe continued, “I think something that would be a perfect complement to tariffs would be a complete cutting off of capital flows from America to China. It’s crazy that our pension funds, for example, are supporting companies in China that make weapons, for example. We tried to stop that.”\n\nIn November 2020, Trump issued an executive order prohibiting purchases by American investors of stocks in companies determined by the US Defense Department to be owned or controlled by the Chinese military. In June 2021, the Biden administration replaced this order with a revised version that in some ways expanded upon the original, including by widening the scope of Chinese companies that could be sanctioned.\n\nNavarro said that “China is an existential threat to the country,” and added, “My view is and has long been that we should stop doing any kind of business with them until they cease their economic aggressions. Geopolitical, revanchist, and imperialist aggression.”\n\nPointing to the need for America to show strength in the face of totalitarian China’s continuing and intensifying aggression, Navarro said, “Strength invites peace, weakness invites war.”', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2021/01/28/CPAC_2019_9A6A5372-1-1200x800.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:57'}

But when it became a cesspit of hate and harassment for women and people of color in particular, it began to offer a miserable bargain: You can be free to say what you wish, but your life can be made unrelentingly painful if you so dare.\n\nThe “censorship” that Mr. Musk performatively deplores consists of efforts to rectify these very real problems of harassment and abuse. Twitter has taken modest but wildly inadequate steps to improve safety on the platform. It has acknowledged it has a problem. It has recognized positive freedom of speech — the creation of a safe and non-life-ruining environment for the airing of thoughts. And it is this that Mr. Musk and his ilk seem to loathe.\n\nThis is why his deal to purchase Twitter is so dangerous. In recent years, there has been progress toward positive freedom of speech — real work to give everyone, truly everyone, more meaningful occasion to speak. Mr. Musk apparently wants to shut that down. Instead, in a moment of proto-fascism on the political right, his priority seems to be to undam the flood of bile and bigotry and bullying and disinformation.\n\nThe country already faces the very real prospect, starting at noon on Jan. 20, 2025, of a descent toward racist authoritarianism and a protracted slide away from liberal democracy. If your idea of what the country needs in this moment is less clamping down on hate and lies and more rightists gone wild, whew.\n\nThe plutocrats have already rigged the economy. That’s just the first step. Then you take some of the spoils and reinvest it in buying even more political influence, so that political inequality can help keep economic inequality yawning. You buy up media or social media platforms and thus can help rig the discourse in your favor, taking control of the tools used by regular people to fight back. You venture, as Mr. Musk did, to a TED conference and, without much pushback, brand yourself as a kind of public intellectual, a thought leader, a visionary, and thereby in many people’s minds you became a sage, not a robber baron.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be this way. We can have nice things. But we’re going to have to learn to see through the fraudulent stories that elevate figures like Mr. Musk into heroes. We’re going to have to legislate real guardrails — perhaps like those created by the European Union’s Digital Services Act — on social media platforms that are too big to entrust democracy to. We’re going to have to build nonprofit alternatives to the platforms and see if they can become meaningful venues.', 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/26/opinion/26giridharadas_2/26giridharadas_2-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:56'}

Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency created as a 'joke' in 2013. Its mascot is a Shiba Inu dog, made popular from the 'doge' meme featuring photos of the canine overlaid with text written in broken English. It can be bought or sold on crypto exchanges like Coinbase or on trading apps like Robinhood and Webull. One Dogecoin is worth 16 cents as of Tuesday morning. It's never been worth more than 64 cents. Creator Billy Markus said last year that he invented the coin as a joke.

It feels silly, but there's this huge upwelling behind it.'

Co-founder Jack Dorsey (right) holds a board seat, but is expected to give it up in May\n\nMusk is known for using Twitter to post inflammatory messages, much like former President Donald Trump.\n\nParag Agrawal, the CEO, said on Monday that it was up to Musk to decide whether to readmit Trump.\n\nTrump on Monday said he would not be rejoining the site if Musk allowed him to - instead saying he would continue to use his own TRUTH Social.\n\nSome experts are pointing to a tough road ahead for Twitter if Musk, who calls himself a free speech absolutist, gets his way.\n\n'We expect advertisers will be less willing to spend on Twitter if Elon Musk removes content moderation in order to promote free speech,' MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson said.\n\nThe 16-year old company, which has emerged as one of the world's most influential online public squares with about over 200 million users, reported $4.51 billion in ad revenue for 2021, accounting for about 89% of its overall sales.\n\n'The challenge (for Twitter) will be maintaining and building revenue given that the controversial opinions (Musk) hopes to give more of a free rein to are often unpalatable to advertisers,' Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Susannah Streeter said.\n\nTesla tycoon versus Big Tech: How swashbuckling billionaire Elon Musk fought off 'poison pill', lawsuits and hostile board of directors before $44bn Twitter takeover\n\nIt has been one of the most dramatic takeover attempts in history, seeing a swashbuckling billionaire pitted against one of the largest tech giants in the world.\n\nBut Elon Musk's seizing of Twitter has been a months-long pursuit that has seen him send shockwaves through the world of business.\n\nThe Tesla magnate started hoarding shares in the social media firm at the start of the year in an apparent bid to preserve free speech online.\n\nHe quickly rocketed to the top of its shareholders' list, acquiring a huge 9% stake in the tech giant.\n\nBut then he hit choppy waters, accepting a place on the board then rejecting it, getting embroiled in lawsuits and seeing rival companies circle to buy Twitter.\n\nMeanwhile bosses at the social media firm appeared to do all they could to ensure he could not not seize it - even launching a 'poison pill' strategy to sink his chances.\n\nYet Musk brazenly blasted through all the obstacles, punting a $43 billion offer earlier this month and showing how he would finance it.\n\nThe two sides were reportedly working into the early morning on Monday to finalize the 'fast-moving' negotiations.\n\nIt saw Twitter shares in the US soar by four percent as the markets opened to $50.84 a share.\n\nOn Monday, Musk called for his 'worst critics' to remain on the platform because 'that is what free speech means'.\n\nHere, DailyMail.com looks at the rollercoaster journey he has been on over the last few months as he seizes his prize.\n\n\n\nThe Tesla magnate started hoarding shares in the social media firm at the start of the year in an apparent bid to preserve free speech online\n\nJanuary 31: Musk hoards Twitter shares and buys them 'almost daily'\n\nMusk started buying Twitter stock on January 31 and continued to buy shares during every trading session through April 1, according to an SEC filing.\n\nJust days earlier, he told his 80 million followers on the site he was ' giving serious thought ' to creating his own social media platform.\n\nA user asked him: 'Would you consider building a new social media platform, @elonmusk?\n\n'One that would consist an open source algorithm, one where free speech and adhering to free speech is given top priority, one where propaganda is very minimal. I think that kind of a platform is needed.'\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO replied through his official account: 'Am giving serious thought to this.'\n\nThe billionaire businessman, 50, appeared to be suggesting he was sick of Twitter over the right to freedom of speech.\n\nApril 4: Musk says he bought 9.2 percent stake in firm a month earlier\n\nMusk revealed he had purchased a 9.2 percent stake in the social media giant on March 14.\n\nHe tweeted 'oh hi lol' after the news sent shockwaves through the business world and across social media. He added: 'Do you want an edit button?'\n\nApril 5: He joins Twitter's board of directors - sees share price rocket\n\nTwitter said the tech tycoon was joining the company's board of directors, causing the social media platform's shares to rise over 7 per cent in premarket trading.\n\nIt led to speculation he would try to address what he called the platform's 'failure to adhere to free speech principles' and 'fundamentally undermine democracy'.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Musk would have served on the board until the company's 2024 annual shareholders meeting.\n\nAs long as he remains a director, the agreement said, he could not won more than 14.9 percent of the company's stock.\n\nIt meant he would not have been able to take over the company until well after his term on the board was over.\n\nThe firm said: 'Twitter is committed to impartiality in the development and enforcement of its policies and rules.\n\n'Our policy decisions are not determined by the Board or shareholders, and we have no plans to reverse any policy decisions.'\n\n'As always our Board plays an important advisory and feedback role across the entirety of our service.\n\n'Our day to day operations and decisions are made by Twitter management and employees.'\n\nApril 8: Asset managers take over Musk as largest shareholders\n\nAsset manager Vanguard Group increased its stake to overtake Musk as the largest shareholder.\n\nVanguard owned 10.3 percent of Twitter, while the Tesla tycoon owned 9.1 per cent, making him the largest individual shareholder.\n\nVanguard, led by CEO Tim Buckley, increased its stake in the company at some point during the first quarter, according to SEC filings made on April 8.\n\nIt previously reported owning 67.2million shares of Twitter or about 8.4 per cent of the company as of the end of December, according to FactSet.\n\nOther owners of large quantities of Twitter stock included Morgan Stanley, Fidelity and Black Rock.\n\nVanguard, led by CEO Tim Buckley, increased its stake in the company at some point during the first quarter, according to SEC filings made on April 8\n\nApril 9: Musk rejects the offer to join Twitter's board of directors\n\nMusk rejected an offer to join Twitter's board after disclosing his stake in the company.\n\nAnalysts said the move signaled his intention to take over the company as a board seat would have limited his stake to just under 15 per cent.\n\nParag Agrawal said the board would still 'remain open' to Musk's input, but warned: 'There will be distractions ahead but our goals and priorities remain unchanged.'\n\nHe said: 'The board and I had many discussions about Elon joining the board, and with Elon directly. We were excited to collaborate and clear about the risks.\n\n'We also believed that having Elon as a fiduciary of the company where he, like all board members, has to act in the best interests of the company and all our shareholders, was the best path forward. The board offered him a seat.'\n\nAgrawal continued: 'We announced on Tuesday that Elon would be appointed to the board contingent on a background check and formal acceptance.\n\n'Elon's appointment to the board was to become officially effective 4/9, but Elon shared that same morning that he will no longer be joining the board.'\n\nParag Agrawal said the board would still 'remain open' to Musk's input, but warned: 'There will be distractions ahead but our goals and priorities remain unchanged'\n\nApril 12: Twitter shareholder Marc Bain Rasella files suit against Musk\n\nMarc Bain Rasella filed a lawsuit against Musk for alleged securities fraud at a Manhattan federal court, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nThe suit claimed the billionaire was required to disclose his holdings to the SEC by March 24, but the delay kept Twitter's share price down allowing Musk to buy more.\n\nMusk was accused of violating a regulatory deadline to reveal he had accumulated a stake of at least five per cent.\n\nInstead, according to the complaint, Musk did not disclose his position in Twitter until he had almost doubled his stake to more than nine per cent.\n\nThat strategy, the lawsuit alleges, hurt less wealthy investors who sold shares in the company in the nearly two weeks before Musk acknowledged holding a major stake.\n\nApril 14: The Tesla tycoon offers to buy Twitter for $43 BILLION\n\nMusk offered to buy Twitter for $43billion, a regulatory filing showed, as he moved to seize the social media giant.\n\nMusk's offer price of $54.20 per share represented a 38 per cent premium to the closing price of Twitter's stock on April 1.\n\nThis was the last trading day before the Tesla CEO's over nine per cent investment in the company was publicly announced.\n\nIt even appeared to reference marijuana - also known as 420 - a common reference used by Musk on Twitter.\n\nTwitter said in a regulatory filing Musk provided a letter containing a proposal to buy the remaining shares of Twitter he did not already own.\n\nApril 15: Twitter launches 'poison pill' strategy to stop Musk buyout\n\nTwitter's board announced a dramatic poison pill plan to prevent Musk from increasing his stake in the company.\n\nAlso known as a shareholder rights provision, the plan would trigger a dilution of shares if any shareholder builds up a 15 per cent stake without the board's approval.\n\nThe plan did not prevent Twitter from accepting Musk's offer or entering negotiations with him or other potential buyers.\n\nBut it did stop the billionaire from putting pressure on the board by buying up ever more shares on the open market.\n\nMusk hit back with a laughing emoji to a version of the classic 'Distracted Boyfriend' meme mocking Twitter's board.\n\nThe imaged depicted 'Twitter's board' looking wistfully at the option to 'keep that easy gig that gives me shares' as 'Twitter investors' look on with disgust.\n\nTwitter's board is led by chairman Bret Taylor, who is also the co-CEO of business software giant Salesforce\n\nApril 16: Musk tweets Love Me Tender in tease of hostile takeover\n\nMusk tweeted 'Love Me Tender' as he again teased at the possibility of a hostile takeover of Twitter.\n\nThe billionaire posted the Elvis Presley lyrics in a potential bid to lure shareholders with a tender offer that could see him seize control.\n\nA tender offer would see him bypass the board and go to shareholders with his offer of $54.20 a share - but he would need to show how he would finance his bid.\n\nHe also appeared to suggest he would strip board members of their salaries, saying they would get '$0 if my bid succeeds'.\n\nApril 18: Jack Dorsey slams the Twitter board for 'plots and coups'\n\nJack Dorsey slammed the board of Twitter as he weighed into the toxic fight over Elon Musk's attempted hostile takeover for the first time.\n\nThe former CEO, who is still a member of the board himself, blasted the 'plots and coups' that were 'consistently the dysfunction of the company'.\n\nIn a series of bombshell tweets and replies, he endorsed one posting saying that 'a bad board will kill a company every time'.\n\nReplying to one post, he said: 'When I was fired in 2008 and made chair, the board took most of my shares away from me.\n\n'I also gave 1 per cent of the company back to the employee pool in 2015. So, ended up with very little of company.'\n\nHe also replied to one comment mentioning 'plots and coups' in the Twitter board saying: 'it's consistently been the dysfunction of the company'.\n\nEarlier in the thread, he replied to a post quoting a 'Silicon Valley proverb' by venture capitalist Fred Destin.\n\nIt said: 'Good boards don't create good companies, but a bad board will kill a company every time.' Dorsey said: 'Big facts.'\n\nFormer CEO Dorsey slammed Twitter's board of directors on as he replied to a series of unfriendly tweets\n\nApril 21: SpaceX boss unveils his $46.5billion financing package\n\nElon Musk unveiled his $46.5billion financing package to fund his takeover of Twitter - using Tesla as collateral.\n\nThe world's richest man filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission outlining how he would seize the social media giant.\n\nHe committed $21billion in equity, $13billion from Morgan Stanley in debt facilities and another $12.5billion from the bank and others in margin loans.\n\nBut 'a portion' of his shares in Tesla have been put forward as collateral, which analysts feared could have a huge impact on the firm.\n\nThe 50-year-old billionaire also revealed he was weighing up launching a tender offer for Twitter after the company ignored his acquisition offer.\n\nHe said he was exploring getting stocks directly from shareholders but admitted he 'has not determined whether to do so at this time'.\n\nMusk filed the document with the SEC showing how he planned to take over Twitter for about $46.5billion.\n\nHe secured a debt commitment letter from Morgan Stanley Senior Funding to the tune of $13billion in financing.\n\nThis was made up of a loan of $6.5billion, a senior secured revolving facility for $500million, a bridge loan of up to $3billion and an unsecured bridge loan for up to $3billion.\n\nHe also got a margin loan commitment letter from Morgan Stanley for $12.5 billion in margin loans. And Musk also got $21billion through equity financing.\n\nBut he has used 'a portion' of his shares in Tesla as collateral in the high-stakes move, which analysts warned could have huge ramifications for the company.\n\nApril 22: Musk posts 'boner' killer picture of Bill Gates on Twitter\n\nMusk dissed Bill Gates' gut on Twitter, posting a photo of the Microsoft mogul next to Apple's controversial pregnant man emoji 'in case you need to lose a boner.'\n\nHe posted a follow-up image in response to the Friday post of six hooded figured captioned 'shadow ban council reviewing Tweet'.\n\nThe joke could further infuriate woke Twitter staffers angered by Musk's ongoing bid to buy the firm after saying he would support free speech.\n\nThat is because the pregnant man emoji is aimed at being inclusive to transgender people - with Musk frequently taking aim at what he sees as woke overreach.\n\nApril 25: Musk finalizes deal to buy Twitter\n\nMusk was closing in on seizing Twitter as talks between the Tesla magnate and the tech giant entered their final stages, reports say.\n\nThe tycoon's representatives were said to be hammering out terms including a timeline and fees if an agreement was signed and then fell apart.\n\nThe two sides were reportedly working into the early morning to finalize the 'fluid and fast-moving' negotiations.\n\nTwitter shares soared by four percent as the markets opened to $50.84 a share amid reports it would be seized by Musk.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Twitter announced it had 'entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by an entity wholly owned by Elon Musk, for $54.20 per share in cash in a transaction valued at approximately $44 billion. Upon completion of the transaction, Twitter will become a privately held company.'", 'image': 'https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/26/14/57069119-0-image-a-49_1650980561815.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:46'}

Now the pills are no longer scarce, but they still aren\'t getting to everyone who might benefit from treatment.\n\n"It\'s pretty clear from the uptake of Paxlovid, and the rate of hospitalizations and deaths over the months that Paxlovid has been available, that there are still some folks who could have benefited from these medications," an administration official told reporters on Monday in a briefing to preview the announcement.\n\nFederal officials have voiced concerns publicly for weeks that treatments like Paxlovid, Merck and Ridgeback\'s Lagevrio antiviral pills, and Eli Lilly\'s bebtelovimab monoclonal antibody drug were not reaching enough Americans.\n\nOfficials said Monday that reported use of the antiviral pills has more than doubled over the past month, from 22,000 courses a week to over 55,000. That comes as cases and hospitalizations have begun to climb nationwide, driven by the highly-contagious Omicron BA.2 subvariant.\n\nIn New England, federal data has tracked the pace of new COVID-19 hospitalizations surging among patients 70 and older — the age group most vulnerable to severe COVID-19 — since the beginning of April. The rate of new admissions is now higher than the peak reached over the Delta variant wave last year, but remains a fraction of the record highs during the winter Omicron wave.\n\n"We certainly know that there\'s more room to go. We can save more lives by giving this medication to more people," said the official.\n\nGetting Paxlovid antiviral pills\n\nPaxlovid treatment needs to begin within a few days of first developing symptoms.\n\nA course of treatment is made up of three tablets that are taken twice a day, in the morning and evening, over the course of five days, for a total of 30 pills. Initial clinical trials showed the drug reduced the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization or death by 88%, compared to placebo.\n\nPaxlovid cannot be taken at the same time as several medications that can reduce the drug\'s efficacy or lead to potentially fatal side effects.\n\nThrough outreach to doctors and patients, officials say they hope more eligible Americans will act quickly to get the now-plentiful antiviral pills sitting on pharmacy shelves.\n\nPfizer\'s COVID-19 drug Paxlovid Fabian Sommer/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\n"A lot of providers early on in that scarcity mindset, when there were fewer courses available across the country, were really reserving this for only the folks who they thought would be the sickest of the sick," an administration official told reporters.\n\nOn Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health alert urging doctors to step up prescribing of effective COVID-19 treatments — and imploring at-risk patients who test positive not to delay in contacting their doctors, "even if your symptoms are mild."\n\nA "tranche" of more than 100,000 courses of the antiviral pills will be made available to all of the federal government\'s pharmacy partners to order directly, instead of through federal and local allocations. Officials say they expect the move will raise the number of sites with drugs in stock from 20,000 to 30,000.\n\nThat comes on top of efforts like the administration\'s nationwide "test-to-treat initiative" launched at thousands of pharmacies earlier this year.\n\nFollowing concerns that the program was inaccessible to Americans living in many parts of the country, officials said the administration is planning to launch new "federally-supported Test-to-Treat sites" beyond the 2,200 locations currently in the program.\n\n"I think we\'re going to be working really closely with these new federally supported sites, work directly with state, territorial, and jurisdictional leadership to identify the places that need more support," said an administration official.\n\nChallenges and questions\n\nOfficials acknowledged that the new moves do not address some of the criticisms levied against the Biden administration\'s treatment effort.\n\nDespite objections from pharmacy trade groups, the FDA excludes most pharmacists from being able to prescribe Paxlovid or Lagevrio. For at-risk Americans without access to a "test-to-treat" drugstore that has a qualifying provider available, this means some will have to make multiple trips to get the pills.\n\n"You have to develop COVID symptoms, you have to subsequently get a test for COVID-19, get the result of that test, find and go to see a provider, get a prescription, and then fill that prescription. That\'s six steps in five days," said an official.\n\nIt also does not include an expansion to who is eligible to take the drugs under the FDA\'s emergency use authorization.\n\nSpeaking at Uniformed Services University earlier this month, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the president\'s chief medical adviser, hinted that Paxlovid might soon be expanded to lower-risk patients "in order to prevent them possibly from getting long COVID."\n\nBoth Pfizer and Merck have also been running a range of trials that might support expanding use of the antiviral pills to more people. Results could come soon from a trial assessing Paxlovid in people who are exposed to the disease, but have not yet developed symptoms, which was due to be completed earlier this month.\n\nAnd administration officials at the briefing did not bring up growing reports of "rebound" or "relapse" symptoms — people who appear to recover from COVID-19 after taking the antiviral pills, but later get a new round of symptoms — which might lead to SARS-CoV-2 evolving resistance to the treatments.\n\nA spokesperson for Pfizer said the company was continuing to monitor data from their clinical trials of Paxlovid as well as real-world evidence, and has "not seen any resistance" to the drug.\n\nIn a statement, an FDA spokesperson acknowledged that reports of rebound "are important to evaluate further," but reiterated that the drug appeared 88% effective at reducing the risk of hospitalization or death in its clinical trial.\n\n"The FDA is evaluating the reports of viral load rebound after completing Paxlovid treatment and will share recommendations if appropriate," said the FDA\'s Chanapa Tantibanchachai.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/04/26/75834f94-0c35-4873-8166-5e4b24cfa0d3/thumbnail/1200x630/5625e6265f72e4689718b2845b0511c4/gettyimages-1238865166.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:22'}

Supply of the regimen was initially very limited, but as Covid-19 cases across the country have fallen and manufacturing has increased, it is now far more abundant. The White House is now moving to raise awareness of the pill and its availability, as well as making it easier to access.\n\nThe White House said Tuesday it is increasingly reaching out to doctors and announced that the drug will now be shipped directly to pharmacies, in addition to existing distribution channels run by states. That is expected to increase the number of sites from 20,000 to more than 30,000 next week and eventually to 40,000 locations.\n\nHowever, according to a senior Biden administration official speaking anonymously to Axios, many states are ordering just two-thirds of what is available to them and are using half their orders.\n\nProviders are probably limiting access to the pill because “we’ve had the experience in this pandemic before of operating in a scarcity mindset,” another administration official said in a press conference.\n\nMany states have opted for a lottery system to allocate Paxlovid and other Covid-19 drugs, often choosing to distribute the drugs to retail pharmacies instead of hospitals and clinics.\n\nAccording to Dr Douglas White, a University of Pittsburgh critical care doctor who helped design Pennsylvania’s lottery system for Covid-19 drug allocation, the system ends up favoring people who are not only aware of the drugs but have access to doctors to prescribe it and the ability to locate pharmacies that have them in stock.\n\n“The wealthy and well-connected will win the race,” White told the Los Angeles Times. It’s “the poster child for an unfair system.”\n\nDespite the administration’s attempt to reassure providers that there are enough pills for patients, in an interview with NPR on Monday, the White House’s Covid-19 response coordinator, Dr Ashish Jha, said that there are only enough pills “for the short run.” As of Tuesday, the US had ordered enough supply of the pills for 20 million people, which is estimated to last for several more months.\n\n“Right now, we’ve done a really good job of acquiring pills,” Jha said, adding that the Biden administration will need additional funding from Congress to acquire more pills. “We have to make sure that this is more than a short-term solution.”\n\nJha warned that the US will be running out of money for Paxlovid “reasonably soon,” and that “we actually aren’t even going to be able to pay our bills for what we’ve already entered into a contract with Pfizer for, so that’s going to be a problem.”\n\nThe Biden administration is expected to renew its request to Congress for $22bn in Covid-19 funding.\n\nPaxlovid, when administered within five days of symptoms appearing, has been proven to bring about a 90% reduction in hospitalizations and deaths among patients most likely to get severe disease. About 350 Americans are now dying each day from Covid-19, down from more than 2,600 during the height of the Omicron wave earlier this year.\n\nThe FDA authorized Pfizer’s drug for emergency use in adults and children age 12 or older with a positive Covid-19 test and early symptoms who face the highest risk of severe outcomes. That includes older people and those with conditions like obesity and heart disease, though the drug is not recommended for patients with severe kidney or liver problems.\n\nThe administration is also working to expand the number of “test-to-treat” sites that provide a one-stop shop for those with Covid-19 to get tested for the virus, consult with a medical professional if they’re positive and fill a prescription for Paxlovid on site.\n\nThere are now 2,200 such locations nationwide, though the administration hopes more sites come online in the next several weeks with support from the Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and pharmacy companies.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ec9f8e72eff2d14c7cbb28bd8af41604fea72e5/0_301_5075_3047/master/5075.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=269eeb032fb24072e4c2185b17d3cc66', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:54'}

TWTR -3.91% will need to follow the bloc’s new rules for tackling illegal and harmful content online if it wants to keep operating there, marking a possible challenge to Elon Musk’s plans to take a more hands-off approach to content moderation.\n\nThierry Breton, EU internal market commissioner, said Tuesday in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that it’s his job to make sure companies, including Twitter, understand their obligations in Europe. That will soon include a series of new obligations for social media and other online platforms, called the Digital Services Act, after lawmakers agreed to the main points of the legislation last week.\n\n“Now we have very clear rules,” Mr. Breton said. “They can do whatever they want outside of Europe…but in Europe they will just have to fulfill [our] rules and obligations.”\n\nThe Digital Services Act aims to force platforms to take more responsibility for the content their users post online. It will introduce a series of obligations for large social-media networks like Twitter, ranging from new standards for taking down illegal content to a requirement to conduct annual risk assessments detailing how they are responding to harmful content that is posted online.\n\nTwitter will become a private company if Elon Musk’s $44 billion takeover bid is approved. The move would allow Musk to make changes to the site. WSJ’s Dan Gallagher explains Musk’s proposed changes and the challenges he might face enacting them.

He is familiar with European rules on automotive, and will quickly adapt to the Digital Services Act.”\n\nMr. Musk’s purchase of Twitter could mark an eventual test case for the EU’s new legislation once it comes into effect, said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond. While there are questions about whether the European Commission will have the resources to fully enforce the new law, Prof. Tobias said, “I do think [Mr. Musk] is on notice, and Twitter shareholders, too.”\n\nMr. Musk wrote on Twitter Tuesday afternoon that his view of free speech is speech that “matches the law.”\n\n“I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law,” he said. “If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect.”\n\nMr. Breton said the EU was careful in setting its regulations to maintain freedom of speech. He said he had interactions with many platforms during the lawmaking process and was open to meeting with others, in a comment that appeared to be aimed at Mr. Musk. “If any new shareholder of these platforms is willing to engage with me, my door will be totally open, like always,” he said.\n\nThe EU’s new legislation won’t prevent Mr. Musk from taking a more free-speech-oriented approach, said Zach Meyers, a senior research fellow with the Centre for European Reform think tank.

In the wake of this "great deplatforming," Republicans\' longstanding gripes with these platforms became a legislative priority.\n\nOne of the most aggressive of these Republican-led efforts to regulate social media is Texas\' H.B. 20. Ostensibly passed to combat the "dangerous movement by social media companies to silence conservative viewpoints and ideas," this bill prohibits social media platforms from removing users or content "based on the viewpoint" of the user or content. In its effort to protect conservative speech, Texas Republicans have adopted a historically discredited left-wing legal theory, dispensing with core conservative values in the process.\n\nIn the 1960s, a group of progressive scholars argued that the First Amendment does not merely prohibit the government from censoring private speech and press. In fact, they argued, it granted the government the affirmative power to control the mass media. In a capitalist system, they reasoned, the government must ensure that private media owners do not exclude unwelcome viewpoints, in order to protect the "democratic interest" in free speech. To this end, the scholars championed the Fairness Doctrine, right-of-reply mandates, and expansive applications of "common carriage" doctrine, which enable the government to force the inclusion of certain content.\n\nBorrowing from the same playbook, Texas now argues that First Amendment values require, rather than prohibit, government interference with private speech. H.B. 20 declares that social media platforms are common carriers like telephone companies and thus are subject to onerous restrictions over who and what they may host. According to Texas, H.B. 20 serves the democratic interest in protecting the free exchange of ideas and information. But like the collectivist efforts that preceded it, Texas\' misguided attempt to advance "First Amendment rights in the Lone Star State" violates private platforms\' First Amendment rights to choose what speech they publish.\n\nAs we explained in a recently filed amicus curiae brief on behalf of the Cato Institute, courts have repeatedly rejected such regulations, and for good reasons.\n\nFirst, as a federal district court correctly noted last year, the First Amendment protects social media platforms\' discretion to publish or remove content. The Supreme Court established this right in the 1974 case Miami Herald Publishing Company v. Tornillo, when it struck down a Florida law that forced newspapers to print responses to their criticism of political candidates. The Court explained that this "right-of-reply" law infringed on newspapers\' right to choose what content they publish.\n\nThe Supreme Court affirmed that First Amendment rights apply with full force to internet media in 1997\'s Reno v. ACLU. Other federal courts have since upheld the editorial rights of search engines and social media sites. These precedents doom the Texas law. The state can\'t eviscerate platforms\' well-established First Amendment rights by arbitrarily calling them common carriers.\n\nSecond, efforts like H.B. 20 chill, rather than encourage, the exercise of free speech. Both the Florida right-of-reply law and the Fairness Doctrine actually discouraged the media from covering controversial topics that would trigger the forced-hosting requirements. Likewise, H.B. 20 will encourage platforms to ban entire subjects (say, discussions of terrorism) to avoid facing the unappetizing choice to either host objectionable viewpoints (such as pro-terrorism material) or face liability for removing each piece of content.\n\nThird, H.B. 20 violates fundamental property rights by forcing private platforms to host users and content they would otherwise exclude. The First Amendment does not authorize the government to co-opt private property to amplify certain viewpoints.\n\nThe supporters of the Texas law, like other conservative opponents of Big Tech, cite anecdotal accounts of inconsistent content moderation to support their claim of unfair bias. But it\'s more likely that these incidents are just casualties of the margin of error inherent in content moderation at scale. "Incorrect" removals of content happen millions of times per day to users representing every conceivable ideology. Conservatives are removed from platforms when they violate platforms\' terms of service, but Texas\' premise that conservatives are being unfairly targeted is unsubstantiated.\n\nBut even if it was substantiated, forced-hosting laws like H.B. 20 would contravene limited government, constitutional fidelity, and strong property rights, all of which are supposed to be core conservative values. If Texas Republicans really want to protect "conservative viewpoints," they should reacquaint themselves with those principles and reject giving the government more control over social media.', 'image': 'https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2022/04/timothy-hales-bennett-OwvRB-M3GwE-unsplash-scaled.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:31'}

Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), the chairwoman of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, said allowing Trump back on Twitter would be a major problem.\n\n“I think that’s very problematic,” she said of Trump’s possible return. “I don’t think that somebody who encouraged and organized a violent insurrection to take over our government should be allowed on Twitter.”\n\nAsked about the loosening of content standards, she said she “would certainly have concerns” but added she hadn’t looked at the deal closely enough to “get into a big analysis.”\n\nTrump, who has launched a social media venture that includes a platform intended to vie with Twitter, told Fox News on Monday that he doesn’t plan to return to Twitter.\n\n“I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,” he said, referring to his Truth Social messaging platform, before the deal was announced. “I hope Elon buys Twitter because he’ll make improvements to it and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth. The bottom line is, no, I am not going back to Twitter.”\n\nTwitter permanently suspended Trump because of what it called “the risk of further incitement of violence” after a mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to halt the certification of President Biden’s victory.\n\nTwitter later unveiled a civic integrity policy that prohibited the use of its services for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes. It also reserved the right to flag or reduce the visibility of tweets containing false or misleading information about civic processes.\n\nAt a TED conference this month, Musk stressed the importance of allowing free speech on Twitter.\n\n“Twitter has become kind of the de facto town square, so it’s just really important that people have both the reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely within the bounds of the law,” he said.\n\nConservatives on Monday applauded Musk’s move.\n\n“Elon Musk did his part for free speech today. Let’s hope the Supreme Court does as well,” former Rep. Mark Walker (N.C.), a conservative Republican running for Senate, tweeted Monday afternoon.\n\nDemocrats are worried what that means for policing claims that Biden stole the 2020 presidential election or misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n“I’m a big free speech guy, but this stuff isn’t working. It’s terrorizing democracy, and from that perspective I think it’s bad for Democrats in this sense: These Republican alt groups tend to dominate. They tend to have much more of a footprint on these social media platforms than Democrats do,” said Steve Jarding, a Democratic strategist and former senior adviser to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\nJarding is also the communications director for a new social media platform called Pixstory, which has a business model designed to root out hate and misinformation by giving integrity scores to people who post on the site.\n\nBut Jarding called it “a horrible problem” that the world’s richest person is taking over a major means of political discourse at a time when Democrats are discussing proposals to tax the unrealized capital gains of multibillionaires such as Musk to pay for proposals to fight climate change and economic inequality.\n\n“He could turn it into anything that he wants. He controls literally hundreds of millions of hits, if you will, or clicks on a platform that he can determine whether it’s used in a good way or a bad way, and that’s too much concentration with one individual,” Jarding added.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/stabenowdebbie_020922arl.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:10'}

As YouTube celebrates its 17th birthday, the game-changing user-generated video platform once known for funny pet videos and other benign content continues to attract criticism for its alleged role in fostering extremism. Ample evidence casts doubt on the idea that social media platforms are radicalizing American youth, but high-profile anecdotes about bad turns allegedly inspired by YouTube, Facebook, and other sites make it hard to combat such claims. Now one such story may come before the Supreme Court—and threaten a foundational internet speech law.\n\nThe case (Gonzalez v. Google LLC) involves a man whose daughter was killed in a 2015 ISIS attack in Paris. The grieving father, Reynaldo Gonzalez, sued YouTube\'s parent company, Google, under the U.S. Anti-Terrorism Act. Gonzalez claims that ISIS posted recruitment videos on YouTube, that YouTube recommended these videos to users, and that this led to his daughter\'s death.\n\nGonzalez\'s circumstances are tragic, but his claim is convoluted and patently illogical. To buy it, you have to buy the idea that without YouTube, the terrorist group not only would be unable to recruit members but would cease to use existing networks to carry out attacks.\n\nThe Supreme Court has not yet decided whether it will hear Gonzalez\'s case. But if it does, it could give the Court a chance to consider the parameters of Section 230, the federal law preventing internet companies and users from being liable for all third-party speech (and pretty much the backbone of the internet as we know it).\n\nSCOTUSblog notes that in 2020, Justice Clarence Thomas suggested that "in an appropriate case, we should consider whether the text of this increasingly important statute aligns with the current state of immunity enjoyed by Internet platforms." (Thomas made a similar suggestion earlier this year.)\n\n"The petition in Gonzalez v. Google LLC tries to present itself as the case Thomas has been looking for," writes Andrew Hamm:\n\nThe district court dismissed Gonzalez\'s claim on the ground that Section 230 nonetheless protected Google for its recommendations because ISIS produced the videos, not Google. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit affirmed, concluding that Section 230 protects such recommendations, at least if the provider\'s algorithm treated content on its website similarly. However, the panel in Gonzalez considered itself bound to reach this result because of a recent case on the same issue that another 9th Circuit panel decided while Gonzalez was pending. The Gonzalez panel further concluded that, if it could resolve the question itself, Section 230 would not protect a provider\'s content recommendations. Gonzalez admits that the circuits to face this question are not split. Instead, Gonzalez suggests that, had his case simply come out before the other 9th Circuit decision, then Google would be the one seeking review. Regardless, he maintains, the providers\' financial dependence on advertisements and hence on algorithms that can target users makes this question of recommendations important to resolve.\n\nGonzalez is far from the first person to sue social media companies over terrorist acts. But these people "have yet to talk a court into agreeing with their arguments," as Tim Cushing noted at Techdirt last fall.\n\n"The facts in these cases are invariably awful: often people have been brutally killed and their loved ones are seeking redress for their loss. There is a natural, and perfectly reasonable, temptation to give them some sort of remedy from someone, but as we argued in our brief, that someone cannot be an internet platform," wrote constitutional lawyer Cathy Gellis in 2017:\n\nThere are several reasons for this, including some that have nothing to do with Section 230. For instance, even if Section 230 did not exist and platforms could be liable for the harms resulting from their users\' use of their services, for them to be liable there would have to be a clear connection between the use of the platform and the harm.\n\nSection 230 "should prevent a court from ever even reaching the tort law analysis," added Gellis. "With Section 230, a platform should never find itself having to defend against liability for harm that may have resulted from how people used it."\n\nA new study backs up what advocates for Section 230 have been saying for a long time: The law protects small companies and creators more than big tech giants.\n\n"If you understand the mechanisms by which Section 230 actually works, the key is that it gets frivolous and wasteful lawsuits kicked out of court much earlier—when the costs are still intense, but more bearable," points out Mike Masnick in a Techdirt post about the study. "Without Section 230, the end result of the court case may be the same—where the company wins—but the costs would be much, much higher. For Facebook and Google that\'s not going to make a huge difference. But for smaller companies, it can be the difference between life and death."\n\n"Larger enterprises are less impacted by lawsuits," point out the authors of the study, in a report titled "Understanding Section 230 & the Impact of Litigation on Small Providers." A large company "may already have: 1) lawyers ready to deal with lawsuits (allowing the business to continue with minimal disruption); 2) insurance coverage that can offset the cost of a defense, a settlement, or a damage award; and 3) sufficient revenue and cash reserves such that most cases are viewed as a cost of doing business rather than a cataclysmic event."\n\nSmall companies are less likely to have or be able to afford any of these things, making it less likely that they will fight even lawsuits that they would win.\n\nPoliticians, alas, have taken to scapegoating Section 230 for basically anything they or their constituents don\'t like about the internet. And lawyers keep getting creative in their anti–Section 230 arguments, suggesting that while Section 230 may broadly protect internet platforms from liability for many things that users post, the law does not covers various facets of these platforms—their design, their algorithms, etc..\n\nOccasionally, judges appear sympathetic to this. In Taamneh v. Twitter, which the 9th Circuit ruled on last year, Judge Marsha Berzon wrote that Section 230 protects "only traditional activities of publication and distribution—such as deciding whether to publish, withdraw, or alter content—and does not include activities that promote or recommend content or connect content users to each other. I urge this Court to reconsider our precedent en banc to the extent that it holds that section 230 extends to the use of machine-learning algorithms to recommend content and connections to users."\n\n"This is a really weird, really dangerous place to start drawing the line in Section 230 lawsuits," wrote Tim Cushing last summer. "Algorithms react to input from users. If YouTube can\'t be held directly responsible for videos uploaded by users, it makes sense it would be immunized against algorithmically suggesting content based on users\' actions and preferences. The algorithm does next to nothing on its own without input from content viewers. It takes a user to really get it moving."\n\nFREE MINDS\n\nA federal appeals court has rejected a university\'s ban on "discriminatory harassment." The University of Central Florida\'s "discriminatory harassment" ban likely violates the First Amendment, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals said. The case is Speech First, Inc. v. Cartwright, and you can read the whole ruling here. In essence, the court found the school\'s policy against allegedly discriminatory speech to be too broad:\n\n[T]he policy (1) prohibits a wide range of "verbal, physical, electronic, and other" expression concerning any of (depending on how you count) some 25 or so characteristics; (2) states that prohibited speech "may take many forms, including verbal acts, name-calling, graphic or written statements" and even "other conduct that may be humiliating"; (3) employs a gestaltish "totality of known circumstances" approach to determine whether particular speech, for instance, "unreasonably alters" another student\'s educational experience; and (4) reaches not only a student\'s own speech, but also her conduct "encouraging," "condoning," or "failing to intervene" to stop another student\'s speech. The policy, in short, is staggeringly broad, and any number of statements—some of which are undoubtedly protected by the First Amendment—could qualify for prohibition under its sweeping standards. To take a few obvious examples, the policy targets "verbal, physical, electronic or other conduct" based on "race," "ethnicity," "religion [or] non-religion," "sex," and "political affiliation." Among the views that Speech First\'s members have said they want to advocate are that "abortion is immoral," that the government "should not be able to force religious organizations to recognize marriages with which they disagree," that "affirmative action is deeply unfair," that "a man cannot become a woman because he \'feels\' like one," that "illegal immigration is dangerous," and that "the Palestinian movement is anti-Semitic."\n\nIn a concurring opinion, Judge Stanley Marcus warned against "the grave peril posed by a policy that effectively polices adherence to intellectual dogma."\n\n"History provides us with ample warning of those times and places when colleges and universities have stopped pursuing truth and have instead turned themselves into cathedrals for the worship of certain dogma," wrote Marcus. "By depriving itself of academic institutions that pursue truth over any other concern, a society risks falling into the abyss of ignorance. Humans are not smart enough to have ideas that lie beyond challenge and debate."\n\nThe Volokh Conspiracy has more on the ruling (which includes the lovely line "the state is a really big boy") here.\n\nFREE MARKETS\n\nPrivate space mission on its way back to earth. The first privately-funded trip to the International Space Station started its return trip yesterday. More from CNN:\n\nThe mission, called AX-1, was brokered by the Houston, Texas-based startup Axiom Space, which books rocket rides, provides all the necessary training, and coordinates flights to the ISS for anyone who can afford it. The four crew members—Michael López-Alegría, a former NASA astronaut-turned-Axiom employee who is commanding the mission; Israeli businessman Eytan Stibbe; Canadian investor Mark Pathy; and Ohio-based real estate magnate Larry Connor—left the space station aboard their SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule on Sunday at 9:10 pm EST….They will spend about one day free flying through orbit before plummeting back into the atmosphere and parachuting to a splashdown landing off the coast of Florida around 1 pm ET Monday. AX-1, which launched on April 8, was originally billed as a 10-day mission, but delays extended the mission by about a week.\n\nThis isn\'t the first time private citizens have been able to pay for seats on spacecraft. "But AX-1 is the first mission with a crew entirely comprised of private citizens with no active members of a government astronaut corps accompanying them in the capsule during the trip to and from the ISS," reports CNN. "It\'s also the first time private citizens have traveled to the ISS on a US-made spacecraft."\n\nAnd it\'s also a powerful reminder that perhaps the next era of space exploration needn\'t be government funded and managed.\n\nQUICK HITS\n\n• Air Force Major General William T.

For one thing, Twitter is a private company, rather than a genuinely public space, which means that it is not bound by the First Amendment. Unlike the actual town square, Twitter retains the right to punish users for perfectly legal speech. It\'s also the case that while Twitter is incredibly important for the political class, journalists, business leaders, and other social influencers, it\'s not nearly as big or as frequently visited as Facebook, YouTube, or TikTok. As Techdirt\'s Mike Masnick put it, the entire internet is really the town square; Twitter is one small space that\'s part of it.\n\nTwitter\'s social importance is inflated by media and political figures because the site is their preferred virtual meeting ground. This is true of Musk himself; he clearly enjoys the platform, and uses it to great effect, and thus may be overstating its importance to society. But there are many others ways to communicate political messages, and if Twitter ceased to exist tomorrow, it\'s doubtful that anyone\'s ability to speak would be irreparably harmed.\n\nAdmittedly, the people really overstating Twitter\'s importance are actually Musk\'s critics in progressive and mainstream media. And boy are they overstating it: Current Affairs Editor in Chief Nathan Robinson fretted that "the only comforting reason to think [former President] Donald Trump might not win in 2024 is that his prior success was so dependent on his Twitter account. If Musk takes over it\'s very likely that Trump will be back and therefore unstoppable."\n\nThe only comforting reason to think Donald Trump might not win in 2024 is that his prior success was so dependent on his Twitter account. If Musk takes over it\'s very likely that Trump will be back and therefore unstoppable. — Nathan J Robinson (@NathanJRobinson) April 25, 2022\n\nRobinson apparently thinks that Trump\'s ability to win reelection hinges on whether he\'s on Twitter. Not the shape of the U.S. economy, the direction of the pandemic, or whether President Joe Biden\'s ill-considered policies have created an opening for the former president…but Twitter.\n\nFrustratingly, many liberals and progressives—especially in the media—have convinced themselves that the only way to effectively counter bad speech is to label it misinformation or harassment and prevent it from being uttered. This runs counter to Musk\'s stated views on the subject, which reflect classically liberal ideas about speech.\n\nI hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 25, 2022\n\nIt\'s strange to see this idea—that silencing opponents is not only self-defeating but also wrong on principle—transformed into an explicitly right-wing talking point. This is a demoralizing result of the new political reality, in which the journalists and bureaucrats who comprise Team Blue fear and distrust speech they cannot control, while Team Red purports to love free speech even as its political figures wage war on speech they do not like. And it\'s one that does not work to Democrats\' advantage; as Nate Silver points out, free speech in the abstract is extremely popular among the voting public.\n\nThe best way to de-politicize the social media free speech debate—and the optimal thing that Musk could do with control of Twitter—would be to devolve content curation to individual users, as I explained in The Los Angeles Times:\n\n"Elon Musk\'s best bet would be to devolve content curation to individual users. Many on the right are frustrated with Twitter\'s inconsistently applied rules, regardless of whether they are enforced by algorithms or by human employees of the company; many progressives, on the other hand, are afraid that lax moderation means more misinformation or harassment. The least polarizing way forward is to give users more means of controlling their own feeds. If you have a low tolerance for unpleasantness, you should be able to turn on a setting that shields you from the worst of what can appear on the platform. If you prefer the Wild West, there should be a setting for you, too."\n\nIn any case, I hope that fixing Twitter doesn\'t distract Musk from his far more important goal of colonizing Mars (something NPR criticized as imperialist, because of course they did).

I do not want to get into any conversation about [former Vice President Mike] Pence pardoning,” McCarthy says in the Jan. 10 recording as part of a broader conversation about Trump potentially resigning after the riot.\n\nExperts say the committee may want to zero in on that exchange, as the audio shows Republicans at the highest level may have been worried about the legality of Trump’s actions leading up to Jan. 6.\n\n“You would not want to be the middleman in a conversation about Trump being pardoned by Pence because [McCarthy] would be concerned about somebody saying he obstructed justice in some way,” said Jeff Robbins, a former U.S. attorney who also served as chief counsel for the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.\n\n“There’s no need to have a personal fear about being involved in a pardon conversation unless there’s been some suggestion of a conversation about a pardon. And there’s no need to have a discussion about a pardon unless people within McCarthy’s sphere are having serious discussions about Trump’s culpability in a crime,” he added.\n\n“And there’s no need for a pardon if all you’ve done is something that is immoral or unethical or optically bad. The need for a pardon exists when there is criminal culpability.”\n\nThe conversation itself, Robbins said, suggests such questions were likely a topic of conversation among McCarthy and other high-ranking Republicans between Jan. 6 and Jan. 10.\n\nThe select committee has asked McCarthy to voluntarily speak with the committee’s investigators — an invitation he rebuffed.\n\nAmong the things the panel outlined to the minority leader were a desire to speak about his conversations with Trump during and after the attack, as well as prior reports that McCarthy said the former president admitted to being somewhat responsible for the attack — a line receiving renewed attention after being relayed in audio recordings of McCarthy.\n\n“I think it is very important that Kevin McCarthy has evidence the former president acknowledged bearing some responsibility for that attack on the Capitol. This is an admission of guilt by the former president,” Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) told CBS News.\n\n“The reports of what the president said, that he understood that he bore responsibility, that’s consciousness of his guilt. And it is an important element of piecing together all of the facts relative to Jan. 6,” Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), another committee member, told the outlet.\n\nThe criminality of Trump’s actions has been of keen interest to the committee, which recently argued in a civil case that one of his attorneys could not claim attorney-client privilege to shield documents, as such an exception is not valid when legal advice was given in furtherance of a crime. A judge largely agreed with the committee and ordered John Eastman to turn over new documents.\n\nBut Robbins said the discussion around a pardon could be more illuminating when it comes to guilt.\n\n“Saying that he accepted some responsibility is too vague, it could mean a lot of different things,” he said.\n\n“The conclusion that the former president may have actually committed a federal crime comes into play in reference to his personal fear in getting involved in a conversation about a pardon,” he added. “Letting down the American people, none of that implicates any requirement for a pardon. Crimes require pardons.”\n\nBut Michael Stern, who previously served as \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bspecial counsel to the House Intelligence Committee, said the pardon conversation may not carry as much water with Trump, who frequently asserted well before Jan. 6 that he may even be able to pardon himself and used the legal tool heavily while in office.\n\nAnd while McCarthy may have wanted to steer clear of any conversation that involved a quid pro quo, the discussion itself doesn’t indicate guilt related to Jan. 6, Stern said.\n\n“There are many things that [Trump’s] being investigated for which don’t have anything to do with Jan. 6 and which probably are more legally dangerous for him. So [I wouldn’t] draw the conclusion that this was specifically about potential legal jeopardy related to Jan. 6, as opposed to just Trump would recognize the fact that if he left the presidency, with respect to Jan. 6 or lots of other things, he’s going to face a lot of investigations,” and may seek a pardon as a “sweetener” for leaving office, Stern said.\n\nBut getting those details would be difficult, he added.\n\n“As far as if this is something that the committee is interested in, the problem that they have is the problem they have with all of these members, which is they really don’t have a practical way of forcing them to testify,” Stern said.\n\nHe added that while a subpoena is “theoretically available … I just don’t think politically or institutionally it’s going to be something they’re willing to use.”\n\nThere is one member of the committee who may have some insight: Vice Chairwoman Liz Cheney (Wyo.), one of the panel’s two Republicans, who can be heard on the call with McCarthy.\n\n“What’s most notable about it is that it sounds as though he believes that nobody else on the call needs to have a further explanation of it. That is to say, it sounds as if he knows that the question of a potential pardon by Pence has come up in some form. He doesn’t explain what he means, he doesn’t tell people the reason I’m raising this is X, Y, or Z,” Robbins said. “It sounds as though people or their staffs have already been discussing the question of whether or not, for instance, his resignation should be linked in any way to a potential pardon.”\n\nWhile the call could hold value for the committee, it’s less clear it will be of any use to the Department of Justice.\n\n“I don’t think the McCarthy tapes shed any light on a criminal investigation. I think it is harmful to him politically, in that it shows that he appreciated the gravity of Trump’s conduct at one time,” said Barbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney.\n\nIt also might be of more political than investigative value to the committee, which is gearing up for hearings as early as May.\n\n“They need to make a decision about when to just sort of move forward with the information that they have, because they can’t just keep getting more information forever,” said Molly Reynolds, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution who has focused on the committee’s work.\n\nThe committee has been debating whether its final report on the matter should include a recommendation to the Department of Justice to pursue charges against Trump — a referral the department may not chose to take.\n\nBut Reynolds said the bigger picture for the committee is making a compelling case for the public.\n\n“The select committee has a different job than the Department of Justice. The select committee’s job is to hold people accountable in a public way for behavior — some of which may be criminal and some of which may not be —and to tell the story in a way that gets its arms around as much of what happened as possible,” she said.\n\n“That’s hard, but that’s their job.”', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/mccarthykevin_030122gn4_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:50'}

This afternoon, the board accepted Musk\'s offer to buy the company for $54.20 a share.\n\nLong a Twitter power user/troll/loudmouth, Musk bought a 9.2 percent stake in the company last month, becoming the largest shareholder, before deciding he\'d rather have the whole thing.\n\nCue hysteria! Musk haters have taken to the site to declare that Donald Trump will now probably win the 2024 election, that Musk\'s bid is really about white power, that Section 230 must be reformed, and that, yes, Musk\'s new policies will be lethal. (Perhaps the death toll will be even larger than net neutrality\'s!)\n\nSo, for users of the platform, what\'s likely to change?\n\nMusk has panned the site\'s existing content moderation policies, saying they are too restrictive and encroach on people\'s ability to speak freely without being censored. Some liberalization of these policies and the re-platforming of controversial figures like former President Donald Trump—who was banned in the wake of the January 6 riot for inciting violence among his fans—seems likely, though unpopular with droves of users.\n\nAt the mid-April TED conference in Vancouver, Musk talked about his interest in making Twitter\'s algorithm open-source. The Diff\'s Byrne Hobart took this a step further, outlining how "Twitter should monetize a protocol rather than run an app," and explaining the tension between Twitter as a consumer product and as "a way for individual users to update a universal shared database, which can then be filtered based on who\'s interested in what." Hobart claims that it\'s possible that Twitter has been "radically miss-monetized," and that Musk could potentially realign its priorities. However, little of the online discourse has focused on the technical possibilities.\n\nThe new Twitter owner has, through coy tweets, hinted that his new policies will not be applied arbitrarily and that consistent application will mean some number of right-wing users currently cheering his new ownership will surely be disappointed:\n\nI hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 25, 2022\n\nA social media platform\'s policies are good if the most extreme 10% on left and right are equally unhappy — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 19, 2022\n\nElsewhere, Musk has said that Twitter is a "town square" or "public square," and that banning people from using the platform effectively prevents them from participating in the important discussions of the day.\n\nThough people who care about fostering a culture of free speech may agree with the tenor of Musk\'s comments, the analogy is a terrible one. For most of America, the public square is the school board meeting and the town council meeting. There are also numerous other privates spaces for civic engagement: the church pulpit and the post-sermon fray it inspires; neighborhood listservs and the cesspool that is NextDoor; or maybe it\'s Facebook, in-person conversations, and email lists. For many millions of Americans, Twitter is not integral to hashing out values, concerns, and disagreements. Think of the implications if we expected the government to treat such companies—which have their own terms of service and standards that they are free to decide and we are free to consent to—as something akin to public utilities.\n\nIf anything, the new owner of a social media company should convey an inflated sense of the platform\'s worth! But Musk has at times, despite his forceful defense of free speech culture on the internet, repeated confused talking points that indicate scattered thinking while simultaneously failing to fully flesh out what day-to-day operations will look like. For example, a lot of content moderation involves the unsexy—and not very ideological—challenge of keeping spam under control. And, as Mike Masnick points out at Techdirt, Musk doesn\'t seem to have a particularly robust understanding of "hate speech" and how much of what we call hate speech is, in fact, protected by the First Amendment.\n\nA lot remains to be seen about how Twitter will change and what Musk will bring to the table. Optimism, with some reservations about Musk\'s ability to execute, seems warranted. Hysteria—like declaring that it\'s now open season for white supremacists, that Musk\'s vision for free speech will be "lethal," or that Musk is an echo of imperialist, colonizer forebears because he wants to go to Mars—is not.', 'image': 'https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2022/04/thumbnail-9-3.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:46'}

Musk paid $44 billion to acquire the social media platform with the stated aim of turning it into a haven for "free speech."\n\nThe web is awash in speculation over what that means. Conservatives and people booted off the platform have pushed for Musk to reinstate banned accounts, including that of former President Donald Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, prominent Twitter figures are now saying they\'ll leave the platform in protest of its new owner. Among them is English actress Jameela Jamil, who tweeted her fears Monday that Musk "is going to help this hell platform reach its final form of totally lawless hate, bigotry, and misogyny."\n\nIt\'s unclear whether Musk will be able to realize all his plans for Twitter. The tech leader has floated less moderation, less advertising and an open-source algorithm. But Musk\'s stated ideals contradict his own actions.\n\nWhat Musk says he wants\n\nMusk has made clear he wants less moderation — which he considers censorship — on the platform.\n\n"Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated," he said in Monday\'s announcement about the acquisition.\n\nHe also said he wants to defeat the "spambots," or automated accounts that mimic real users; open the algorithm to public inspection and "authenticate all humans" using the platform.\n\nMusk laid out a definition of speech in a TED interview last week.\n\n"A good sign as to whether there is free speech is, is someone you don\'t like allowed to say something you don\'t like? If that is the case, we have free speech," he said.\n\nMusk said Twitter would abide by national laws that restrict speech around the world. Beyond that, he said, he\'d be "very reluctant" to delete posts or permanently ban users who violate the company\'s rules.\n\nHe had previously criticized Trump\'s ban from social media in the wake of the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Twitter and Facebook permanently banned Trump\'s account on the grounds that he incited violence.\n\n"A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech," Musk tweeted days after Trump was banned from both Facebook and Twitter.\n\nHow Musk responds to disagreement\n\nMusk\'s own history, however, puts in doubt his commitment to let people he doesn\'t like speak. As the newsletter Popular Information has documented, Musk has regularly blocked users who criticize him or Tesla; threatened pro-union Tesla employees and company whistleblowers; and has aggressively gone after short-sellers and journalists who are critical of Tesla, sometimes calling their work "false" or "misleading."\n\nIn 2018, he launched a vendetta against Linette Lopez, an Insider journalist critical of Tesla, a move which writer Felix Salmon called "obsessive and deranged."\n\nMusk\'s popular tweets typically send a swarm of his social media fans directly to the accounts of reporters to harass them for hours or days.\n\nSome academics say that Musk\'s hands-off approach threatens to bring Twitter to its bad old days, when harassment and abuse were rampant.\n\n"With Musk, his posturing of free speech — just leave everything up — that would be bad in and of itself," said Paul Barrett, the deputy director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University. "If you stop moderating — with automated systems and human reviews — a site like Twitter, in the space of a short period of time, you would have a cesspool."\n\nSome former Twitter employees are also dismayed by Musk\'s successful bid for the company.\n\n"Twitter is going to let a man-child essentially take over their platform," said Leslie Miley, a former Twitter employee who has also worked for Google and Apple. Miley, who was the only Black engineer at Twitter in a leadership position when he left the company in 2015, echoed doubts shared by others about Musk\'s grasp of the platform\'s complexities.\n\n"I am not sure if Elon knows what he is getting," Miley said. "He may just find that having Twitter is a lot different than wanting Twitter."\n\nUnfettered expression does not attract advertisers\n\nA decade ago, a Twitter executive called the company "the free speech wing of the free speech party," underscoring its commitment to untrammeled freedom of expression. But the company reversed itself after reports of online abuse and harassment became frequent.\n\nIn the U.S., a visceral 2014 article by journalist Amanda Hess exposed the incessant, vile harassment many women faced just for posting on Twitter or other online forums. Twitter also learned about the consequences of an unmoderated social platform: mainly, that it undercut their funding from advertisers.\n\nAds are how Twitter makes money, and companies generally don\'t want their ads running against violent threats, hate speech that bleeds into incitement or incendiary information aimed at tipping elections or undermining public health.\n\nGoogle, Barrett pointed out, quickly learned this lesson the hard way when major companies like Toyota and Anheuser-Busch yanked their ads after they ran ahead of YouTube videos produced by extremists in 2015.\n\nOnce it was clear just how unhealthy the conversation had gotten, Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey spent years trying to improve what he called the "health" of the conversation on the platform.\n\nThe company was an early adopter of the "report abuse" button after U.K. member of parliament Stella Creasy received a barrage of rape and death threats on the platform. The online abuse was the result of a seemingly positive tweet in support of feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez, who successfully advocated for novelist Jane Austen to appear on a British banknote. Creasy\'s online harasser was sent to prison for 18 weeks.\n\nTwitter has continued to craft rules and invest in staff and technology that detected violent threats, harassment and misinformation that violated its policies. After evidence emerged that Russia used Twitter\'s platforms to try to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election, social media companies stepped up their efforts against political misinformation. All have struggled with defining "misinformation," however, and been accused of both leaving up false content as well as over-censoring legitimate posts.\n\nHard to unwind moderation\n\nThe big question now is how far Musk wants to ratchet back these systems — and whether users and advertisers will stick around if he does.\n\nLike Miley, the former Twitter engineer, experts who have studied content moderation and researched Twitter express doubt that Musk knows what he is getting into. After all, there are plenty of fledgling examples of so-called free speech-focused platforms that have been launched in the past few years as Twitter alternatives, largely by conservatives unhappy with the Twitter\'s crackdown on hate, harassment and misinformation. Many such sites have struggled to deal with toxic content, and at least one has been cut off by its own technology providers in protest.\n\n"This move just shows how effective (moderation features) have been to annoy those in power," said Kirsten Martin, a professor of technology ethics at the University of Notre Dame. "I would be worried as to how this would change Twitter\'s values."\n\nThe fact that no other bidders emerged in public before Musk\'s deal was a sign that other would-be acquirers might find Twitter too difficult to improve, said Third Bridge analyst Scott Kessler.\n\n"This platform is pretty much the same one we\'ve had over the last decade or so," Kessler said. "You\'ve had a lot of smart people trying to figure out what they should do, and they\'ve had trouble. It\'s probably going to be tough to make a lot of headway."\n\nEven now, Americans say they\'re more likely to be harassed on social media than any other online forum, with women, people of color and LGBTQ users reporting a disproportionate amount of that abuse. Roughly 80% of users believe the companies are still doing only a "fair or poor" job of handling that harassment, according to a Pew Research Center survey of U.S. adults last year.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/04/30/39aaad79-fd57-40fa-b203-bc4143cf40f2/thumbnail/1200x630g8/aef00fb0dcf931880dd52af0a50dc345/gettyimages-1206290121.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:24'}

Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) questioned Garland on the matter, pointing out that Joe Biden’s messengers, including White House chief of staff Ronald Klain, have said on national television that the president is confident his son, Hunter Biden, did nothing wrong.\n\n“The president’s already told his subordinates—clearly, these are people he can fire at will—that he and his family did nothing wrong.

He claimed that prosecutors were investigating his “tax affairs.”\n\nDavid Weiss, the U.S. attorney for Delaware, later confirmed the investigation but has declined to share any details.\n\nA grand jury subpoena showed that prosecutors compelled banks to share financial records of Hunter Biden and the president’s brother, James Biden.

Because those who are investigating the Biden family and their enterprise can be fired by the head of the family who is being investigated,” Hagerty said.\n\nGarland declined to say whether the department has or is considering appointing a special counsel, though he noted that special counsels are also employees of the Department of Justice.\n\nHe also would not answer when asked if he agreed with the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller, who was tasked with investigating allegations of collusion between Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia.\n\n“The question of whether to have a special counsel is one that is internal decision-making in the department, so I don’t want to make any judgments one way or the other,” Garland told Sen.

The feds have made it so only a vaccine passport, or very limited jab exemptions, will afford you the opportunity to visit family, friends, or travel for work.\n\nThis means that if you lived in, let’s say, Kitchener, Ontario, you could not get on a VIA Rail train and travel to Toronto… even though you could travel from Kitchener to Toronto on a commuter train that is not under federal jurisdiction.\n\nIsn’t “science” wonderful!\n\nOh, and vaccine-free Canadians also can’t LEAVE the country. Unjabbed Canadians are told they can’t “put others at risk” by boarding a plane with vaccinated people (because vaccines suddenly…work?). Apparently, it is good for the unvaccinated to stay in Canada, even though … they are risk to everyone else who is protected by a vaccine?\n\nTrudeau’s insecurity on display\n\nNow, on the one hand it is quite easy to understand why Trudeau is acting like an evil dictator: he has proven himself to be an immoral tyrant on many occasions. However, given the fact that other leftist tyrants have eased up, it is clearly not just leftism or progressivism that causing him to trap Canadians indefinitely in their home like real-life versions of The Truman Show. (How fitting that it was Canadian Jim Carrey who starred in that film.)\n\nThere is something unique about Trudeau that is causing him to become “regressive” as the rest of the leftist dominated West is affording vaccine-free citizens their civil rights.\n\nTo the outside world, Trudeau may look like a confident – if not cringeworthy – tin-pot dictator, but in reality, he is a 50-year-old boy with little to no virtue. He is essentially a spoiled teenager who can remember lines and present himself well in a tailored suit and has a family name that tricked people into thinking he was competent.\n\nHis (Canadian) father, Pierre Trudeau, for all his faults, was shrewd and intelligent – even if evil. Justin Trudeau is evil and unintelligent and quite obtuse.\n\nI can’t help but think he believes he must prove himself as being his own verified dictator in order to fill his daddy’s shoes. Simply put, he is insecure and projecting.\n\n— Article continues below Petition — PETITION: Ask Elon Musk to REINSTATE LifeSite\'s Twitter accounts Show Petition Text 7936 have signed the petition.

Sign this Petition Please SIGN and SHARE this petition to the new owner of Twitter, Elon Musk, asking him to reinstate LifeSiteNews\' truth-telling Twitter accounts which have been suspended since early 2021. After contentious negotiations, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has purchased Twitter, thereby transforming the tech giant into a private company. A self-styled "free speech absolutist," Mr. Musk\'s entrepreneurial spirit may define his approach to governing Twitter, where, in the marketplace of ideas, the best ideas - not those aided by censorship - will naturally prevail among the competition. Of course, there are limits to free speech. But, for too long, Big Tech giants (including, Twitter, Google, YouTube and Facebook) have subjected their conservative and Christian users to all forms of censorship, desperately trying to silence our voices. So if, as it seems, Mr. Musk will level the playing field for conservatives and Christians and allow a true exchange of ideas to occur on his platform, then we look forward to our chance to re-engage on Twitter. Please SIGN and SHARE this petition to the new owner of Twitter, Elon Musk, asking him to reactivate LifeSiteNews\' truth-telling Twitter accounts which have been suspended since early 2021. They are: https://twitter.com/LifeSite\n\nhttps://twitter.com/LSNCatholic\n\nhttps://twitter.com/WCDM_LSN\n\nhttps://twitter.com/WCEA_LSN These accounts have been blocked by the outgoing Twitter regime for more than a year for calling a ‘transgender woman’ (Assistant Secretary of Health, \'Rachel\' Levine), a man, and for tweeting an article about the same person. The article we tweeted makes mention of the troubling paradox of having a person who denies the basic science of the human anatomy be in an authoritative position in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), but does not cast aspersions or any other such “hate speech” against Levine, according to Twitter’s "rules." It is our fervant hope that Mr. Musk intends to allow - rather than censor - our descriptions of reality as we know them to be true in regards to human sexuality, as well as in other areas of life. Mr. Musk evidently understands how significant freedom of speech is to the functioning of a free society as he was quoted as saying that this deal is important for "the future of civlization." LifeSiteNews believes that being able to spread the truth in charity is absolutely vital for the future of society, as the "truth shall make you free." (Jn 8:32) And so, in order for us to charitably spread the truth far and wide, we now seek to re-engage on Twitter\'s public square. Thank you for SIGNING and SHARING this petition to Elon Musk, urging him to now reinstate LifeSiteNews\' suspended Twitter accounts.

The New Democrats have cozied up to Trudeau in order to pretend they are a sane and legitimate party and have promised to prop up his regime. Promises don’t really mean anything when politicians make them, so we shouldn’t assume that the communists will be loyal to each other.\n\nHowever, it is obvious that public opinion is against Trudeau to a degree that he will not be able to withstand.\n\nThere is a reason why Trudeau had to resort to the Emergencies Act to squash the Freedom Convoy; no one wanted to stop it until they were forced to by law.\n\nThe various levels of provincial and municipal governance could have stopped the movement the way they stop any non-violent protest – but they didn’t want to.\n\nDoes this mean that the cops and all the citizens supported the convoy? Of course not, but I think that enough of them saw how absurd things have become and just wanted something to make the whole charade of 2020-2021-2022 go away.\n\nThe application of the Emergencies Act was wildly unpopular among Canadians, both on the Left and the Right. Leftists were happy to see the movement end but were unimpressed that Trudeau ended it in such an absurd way. Conservatives generally supported the movement, and therefore saw Trudeau as a complete lunatic for doing what he did.\n\nAll of this means that in the long run Trudeau is hurting his reputation, even among his base. This is not news for him as the Conservative leadership race heats up.\n\nFreedom is on the move\n\nWithout giving the impression that I think Canada is on the brink of some massive societal restoration, I would be remiss if I did not speak to the positives.\n\nCurrently, we are witnessing the first real Conservative leadership race in a long time. Pierre Pollievre is filling arenas and convention centres with freedom-loving crowds, and Leslyn Lewis is making leftist journalists look silly on national TV. It is worth remembering that we are talking about a leadership race, not an election, but the swell of right-wing uprising is palpable.\n\nIn fact, the last time something like this happened was after a groundswell of Christian/right-wing sentiment following years of leftist oppression under the former Trudeau and his successors.\n\nAs a result of that, we had Stephen Harper for a decade who, although not perfect, was a saint compared with Trudeau.\n\nThe economy is tanking in Canada, and goods and services are becoming prohibitively expensive for average people. Trudeau and his cronies can appeal to idealism and progressivism all they want, but even left-wingers get ticked off and want change when they are struggling to fill the tank.\n\nUltimately, Trudeau is continuing to trap vaccine-free Canadians from participating fully in society because he knows that if he pulls the plug on his last failing restriction, that his regime will go down the drain.\n\nKennedy Hall is an Ontario based journalist for LifeSiteNews.

We are open but on our conditions. At least we know what to tell him: ‘Elon, there are rules. You are welcome but these are our rules.

He said on Monday that “free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy” and described Twitter as “the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated”. -FT\n\nBreton\'s comments come just days after Brussels signed a major piece of legislation targeting big tech for not doing enough to police content online, which runs counter to Musk\'s plan to loosen Twitter\'s content moderation policies to match his stated "free speech absolutist" ideology that could even see the return of former President Donal Trump to the platform (despite Trump\'s insistence he won\'t be back).\n\nAccording to Breton, he\'s simply offering Musk a "reality check" over plans for less stringent moderation, as a lack of compliance risks a ban in Europe.\n\n"Anyone who wants to benefit from this market will have to fulfill our rules. The board [of Twitter] will have to make sure that if it operates in Europe it will have to fulfill the obligations, including moderation, open algorithms, freedom of speech, transparency in rules, obligations to comply with our own rules for hate speech, revenge porn [and] harassment," said Breton, adding "If [Twitter] does not comply with our law, there are sanctions — 6 per cent of the revenue and, if they continue, banned from operating in Europe."', 'image': 'https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2022-04/musk%202.jpg?itok=_6ovvCP5', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:12'}

Jody Hice (R-Ga.), in all caps. A Twitter survey by Sen. Ted Cruz asked if Musk’s purchase was a good thing, with the only options to answer being “yes” or “no, I hate free speech.” His fellow Texan, Rep. John Carter, signaled his approval with no words at all; three clapping-hands emojis were sufficient.\n\nA pot-smoking, meme-posting evangelist for electric vehicles may be an unlikely hero for conservatives. But the Tesla chief executive’s amorphous vow to restore free speech to the social media platform has resonated among Republicans, who see themselves — starting with their de facto leader, former President Trump — as unfairly targeted by Twitter’s content moderation efforts.\n\nConservatives said their euphoric outpouring was bigger than the possible return of @RealDonaldTrump and changes to Twitter’s ownership. Rather, they see Musk’s takeover as a symbolic, and cathartic, blow against Big Tech, which the right has increasingly viewed with antipathy.\n\n“There’s a gut reaction from a lot of people, going, ‘You know what, it’s about time they get their comeuppance,’ ” said Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.). “It finally feels like someone is standing up for a principle that has been going in an opposite direction lately: less free speech, less ability to express yourself — if you are a conservative.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk centered his bid for Twitter on the premise that the social media company, which he considers a “digital town square,” is too restrictive in clamping down on expression.\n\n“I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” Musk tweeted Monday morning.\n\nMusk’s own politics are idiosyncratic. He’s the foremost face of clean vehicles who called for immediately increasing oil and gas production after the Ukraine-Russia war spiked energy prices. He fled California for Texas because of high taxes but declined to weigh in on Texas’ restrictive abortion law, saying he preferred to “stay out of politics.” He has described himself as politically independent and registered to vote in California with no party preference.\n\nFor conservatives, Musk’s crusade against content restrictions has struck a chord. Roughly half of Republicans feel they cannot express themselves freely on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, according to a Morning Consult poll conducted this month, far exceeding the percentage of Democrats and independents who felt similarly.\n\nPolitics Who did Twitter ban during the Trump era, and why? Could banned Trump allies return to Twitter under Elon Musk? A look at the former president’s backers who were kicked off the social media platform.\n\n“Twitter is a platform that I and many others believe has been more aggressive in blocking Republicans and conservatives than they have toward people on the left,” said Rep. Austin Scott (R-Ga.). “I’m hoping and expecting he will undo that.”\n\nScott is not an avid Twitter user; he does not even have the app on his phone. But he did tweet a congratulatory message to Musk, adding a plea to “restore free speech and bring back President Trump!”\n\nTrump was permanently kicked off the platform on Jan. 8, 2021 — two days after a group of his supporters overran the U.S. Capitol in hopes of blocking the certification of Joe Biden’s win. Twitter imposed the ban “due to the risk of further incitement of violence.”\n\nSo far, Musk has not indicated how he’d handle the former president’s account. Trump, meanwhile, has shown no interest in rejoining the platform that helped power his political rise and gave real-time narration of his presidency.\n\n“I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,” Trump told Fox News, referring to his fledgling social media network. “I hope Elon buys Twitter, because he’ll make improvements to it, and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth.”\n\nRepublicans see Trump as just one example of Twitter’s bias. A number of high-profile conservatives have been suspended or blocked from the platform, including the account of the Babylon Bee, a satirical news website that was suspended for a tweet naming Assistant Health Secretary Rachel Levine, who is transgender, “Man of the Year.”\n\nThe account was locked as a violation of Twitter’s ban on hate speech. Seth Dillon, CEO of Babylon Bee, refused to remove the tweet, asserting that “truth is not hate speech.”\n\n“It’s completely broken,” said Harmeet Dhillon, a conservative lawyer who has sued Twitter multiple times on behalf of clients who were banned. “The company can try to affect elections, try to ban politicians from speaking ... use algorithms, enable false accounts to constantly affect what people see.”\n\nThe extent to which conservatives face bias on the platform has been fiercely examined and debated. A study this month by researchers at MIT and Yale found that Republican users tend to be suspended more often than Democrats but that conservatives are more likely to share misinformation that would provoke such suspensions.\n\nSo far, Musk has offered little explanation as to how his free speech values would play out in practice. He said on Monday that his goals include “enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots and authenticating all humans.”\n\nBut such efforts would require some attempt at regulating content, especially by verifying users. A social media network without any moderation at all could swamp the platform with all sorts of unsavory or offensive material, such as pornography or terrorist content, as well as the online abuse and harassment that are already common occurrences.\n\n“If you don’t have content moderation, you actually have less free speech. The people who are the loudest are the bullies and harassers that drive people away,” said Katie Harbath, a former Republican operative who has worked as public policy director for Facebook.\n\nDhillon, the conservative attorney based in California, said she is not hoping for Musk to completely abandon regulation.\n\n“There’s plenty of room for them to do old-school content moderation of the kind they originally did,” she said, citing as an example prohibitions on making death threats.\n\nWith Musk’s plans still unknown, Harbath, who now runs a tech policy strategy firm, said the celebratory conservatives “are making a hell of a lot of assumptions of what Elon means by all this stuff. I don’t think they should assume he is completely on their side.”\n\nRepublicans’ triumphant tone on Twitter starkly contrasted with the more muted reaction from liberal politicians. Far fewer Democratic members of Congress weighed in on Twitter, although those who did were markedly unenthused.\n\n“This deal is dangerous for our democracy. Billionaires like Elon Musk play by a different set of rules than everyone else, accumulating power for their own gain. We need a wealth tax and strong rules to hold Big Tech accountable,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), with whom Musk has sparred on Twitter.\n\nHuizenga, the Michigan congressman, expected that liberals would be none too pleased with Musk’s purchase. Indeed, some vowed to leave the site entirely — much to Huizenga’s amusement.\n\n“It seems like ‘I’m quitting Twitter’ has become the ‘I’m moving to Canada if Trump wins,’ ” he said, adding, “It’s kind of fun sitting back, watching them completely lose their collective minds.”', 'image': 'https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ac14b68/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2941x1544+0+208/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F86%2F23%2Ff46440b54bd7a6509db9c67caab5%2Fphilanthropy-billionaries-tax-28080.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:57'}

(Patrick Pleul/Pool/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nElon Musk Reveals More Details of His Plans for Twitter After Buyout\n\nElon Musk revealed more details of what he has in mind for changes at Twitter after it was confirmed that the company had accepted his buyout offer, with the tech mogul’s plans including new features and ways to enhance trust in the platform.\n\nTwitter’s board of directors said on April 25 that it had approved Musk’s offer to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share in cash, in a deal worth around $44 billion.\n\nThe buyout represents a 38 percent premium over Twitter’s closing stock price on April 1, with Parag Agrawal, CEO of Twitter, saying in a statement that he believes the deal “is the best path forward for Twitter’s stockholders.”\n\n‘Bedrock of a Functioning Democracy’\n\nIn a statement, Musk provided some details about what kind of changes he has in mind for the social media platform, whose commitment to free speech he has repeatedly called into question.\n\n“Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,” Musk said. This dovetails with his earlier statements that Twitter functions as a “de facto town square” where important conversations should be able to take place with as few constraints as possible.\n\nMusk said Monday that Twitter has “tremendous potential” and that he wants to work with the company and its users to “unlock” and make the platform “better than ever.”\n\nHe said he plans on “enhancing” Twitter with new features, which he did not provide further details on. Musk earlier created a Twitter poll asking users if they want an edit button on the platform, suggesting that this could be one of the changes he is seeking to effect.\n\nMusk also said on Monday he wants to make the platform’s algorithms “open source to increase trust,” while “defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.”\n\nThis, too, reinforces his earlier remarks that his objective in seeking to buy Twitter and turn it into a private company was to transform it into a bastion of free speech by opening up its algorithm to public scrutiny and by making its moderation policies more transparent.\n\n‘Black Box Algorithm’\n\nA self-described “free speech absolutist,” Musk told the audience at a recent TED event in Vancouver, Canada, that Twitter should permit unconstrained expression, though it should do so in line with the law.\n\n“In my view, Twitter should match the laws of the country,” Musk said, acknowledging reasonable legal caps on free speech like direct incitement to violence or shouting “fire” in a crowded theater.\n\n“But going beyond that and having it be unclear who’s making what changes to where, having tweets mysteriously be promoted and demoted with no insight into what’s going on, having a black box algorithm promote some things and not other things, I think this can be quite dangerous,” Musk said.\n\n“My strong, intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization,” he added.\n\nErr on Side of Free Speech\n\nMusk also expressed reluctance about permanent bans of users from Twitter, preferring instead temporary “time-outs.”\n\n“I’m not saying that I have all the answers here,” Musk said at the TED talk. But I do think that we want to be just very reluctant to delete things, just be very cautious with permanent bans. Timeouts I think are better than permanent bans.”\n\nIn terms of calibrating Twitter’s moderation policies, Musk said he’d want to err on the side of free speech.\n\n“If in doubt, let the speech, let it exist,” Musk said. “If it’s a grey area, I would say let the tweet exist. But obviously in a case where there’s perhaps a lot of controversy, that you would not want to necessarily promote that tweet.”\n\n“A good sign as to whether there’s free speech is, is someone you don’t like allowed to say something you don’t like,” Musk said. “And if that is the case, then we have free speech.”\n\n‘We Are Concerned’\n\nMusk has repeatedly questioned Twitter’s commitment to free speech, after accusations that the platform suppressed some minority and politically conservative viewpoints, claims Twitter has denied.\n\nMany free speech advocates have hailed Musk’s takeover bid, while those opposed have expressed fear that fewer constraints on expression on Twitter will make it too easy to abuse the platform’s reach and power by, for example, spreading disinformation.\n\nIn a series of tweets reacting to Musk’s takeover moves, Amnesty International expressed concern about the erosion of policies meant to protect users.\n\n“We are concerned with any steps that Twitter might take to erode enforcement of the policies and mechanisms designed to protect users,” Amnesty International wrote.\n\n“The last thing we need is a Twitter that wilfully turns a blind eye to violent and abusive speech against users,” the group said.\n\nAs it was confirmed Musk would purchase Twitter, the Tesla founder urged his “worst critics” to stay on the platform.\n\n“I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” he wrote in a Twitter post.\n\nDan Ives, an analyst at investment firm Wedbush Securities, told the BBC that he expects most users will take a “wait-and-see approach” on whether they stay or leave the platform, based on the changes that take place.\n\n“Now it’s about courting new users and stopping defectors from the platform,” Ives told the outlet.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/19/article-image-cal-thomas-3-1200x804.jpeg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:50'}

This feels like the first flashback scene we see in a dystopian drama after the words “SIX MONTHS EARLIER …” Quite where we’ll be in six months’ time as far as Twitter is concerned remains tantalisingly unclear, but it seems difficult to imagine it will be either a more or less pleasant space. It’s a social media platform. I’m not sure what further evidence humanity needs before we cotton on to the idea that such a thing might be an intrinsically toxic concept. Of course, there will always be some people who think it just hasn’t been done right yet. Like communism, or a British version of The Daily Show.\n\nAnyway, if Musk’s takeover goes through, he’ll assume control of a platform where the people on the right are incredibly angry about free speech, and those on the left are incredibly angry about hate speech. Which is to say: they have so much in common. As the tech visionary Jaron Lanier has long been excellent at pointing out, the best way to keep people on platforms is to make them angry. So the platforms are designed to make them angry. You might consider the anger worth it for your version of advertising (I myself will post this column on Twitter), but even then it is a weirdly grim cost of doing business that just conceivably ought to be weighed far more carefully than it is.\n\nUnlike the UK, Musk manufactures other things besides anger, but Twitter is the platform where, in a single calendar year, his posts led to multiple lawsuits, a fall in his stock price, and a Securities and Exchange Commission settlement that resulted in his chairmanship of Tesla being forcibly ended. Yet in a move that will feel familiar to a lot of Twitter users, he has not logged off, but leaned in further. When I was a child, there was a guy called Victor Kiam who owned Remington, and he would personally feature in the firm’s electric razor adverts, going: “I liked the shaver so much, I bought the company.” It would be nice to see Musk do something similar. “I liked calling innocent people paedos so much, I bought the company.”\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the distress of Twitter users feels overplayed. Perhaps Elon embodies a kind of radical honesty and self-awareness not shared by other denizens of the site. People who seem to spend half their lives complaining about Twitter, on Twitter, seem stunned by the idea that a shitposter would ultimately buy it. Catch up! It doesn’t feel like a complete coincidence that all social media platforms are owned by men you’d run a mile from socially.\n\nMusk is one of them – a brilliant, horrid, ridiculous and very occasionally endearing grotesque. A sort of intergalactically successful Dominic Cummings. And yet, despite Elon’s give-a-toss gift for making himself what Twitter users might call the “main character”, I can’t detest him entirely. If he pulls off the radical green energy transition embodied in Tesla, or even just one of his other wildly ambitious schemes, humans might have to accept some of the shit that’s gone with it. Accept it angrily, of course – how else, we’re on a social media platform! – but accept it nonetheless. A huge number of other people in public life behave appallingly and achieve absolutely nothing but harm.\n\nBut if endlessly righteous folk balk at the mere idea of necessary evils, why do they act like their own involvement in Twitter is one? It isn’t. It’s easy to focus on the high-profile people who are always on Twitter. But the sheer numbers of highly successful, highly creative and highly interesting people in the worlds of arts, business, science and beyond who AREN’T on it should tell a much more powerful story. They are part of all kinds of era-defining creative and commercial conversations and breakthroughs – and somehow manage to do it all without lavishing half the day scrolling past a bunch of other people having a row.\n\nLanier has cast detailed doubt on whether most Twitter advocacy is even meaningfully effective, despite sometimes appearing to be so. If you spend your day caught up in online fighting, it’s preferable to tell yourself you’re involved in consciousness-raising for your cause. An alternative view is that you are simply obsessively polarising your particular debate, to the point where compromise – boring, unfashionable, yet historically always necessary – becomes a more distant possibility.\n\nMy “unpopular opinion”, in one of Twitter’s tellingly popular phrases, is that those who spend a significant amount of time arguing on it work for the platform and not for their cause. The Musk takeover at least makes it easier to see whose pocket you’re putting money into as you delude yourself you’re winning arguments. I’m certainly not saying I follow this rule, but in general I think arguing on the internet is like playing real tennis: even if you win, you’re still a twat.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5899b28a3a52d992407b1aa95d2689c2b1d4703f/0_273_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=e4d7eefe6e510bd81cf93360935a1d81', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:53'}

Yet President Biden has long insisted he had no involvement in his son’s foreign affairs. “I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,” he said in 2019.\n\nNow this…\n\nEric Schwerin made 8 additional White House visits in 2016, according to visitor logs reviewed by Fox News.\n\nThat means Hunter Biden’s closest business partner visited the White House at least 27 times while Joe Biden was Vice President.\n\nEric Schwerin also had a sit-down meeting with Joe Biden.\n\nFox News reported:\n\nHunter Biden’s longtime business partner Eric Schwerin visited the White House at least eight times in 2016, meeting with then-Vice President Biden’s chief of staff Steve Ricchetti, who currently serves as Biden’s White House counselor, and an assistant in Biden’s office who used to work at the investment firm Schwerin and Hunter managed. Those eight additional visits, in addition to 19 previously known Schwerin visits, bring his total number of White House visits during the Obama-Biden administration to 27. Schwerin, the president of since-dissolved investment fund Rosemont Seneca Partners, visited Ricchetti at least twice in 2016. The two visits occurred in room 272 on Feb. 29 and room 276 on Aug. 17 at the Old Executive Office Building (OEOB), according to the 2016 White House visitor logs. Ricchetti has been a longtime adviser to President Biden and served as his chief of staff from 2013 to 2017. He now serves as Biden’s White House counselor. Schwerin also met with Anne Marie Person, who served as a general assistant at Rosemont until 2014 before joining Biden’s office, at least three times between February and June 2016, a Fox News Digital review found. According to White House visitor logs, Schwerin met her in Biden’s “West Wi[ng]” office on Feb. 24, April 8, and June 9. It is unclear if Biden was present for the meetings.\n\nJoe Biden has repeatedly claimed he was never involved with Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings.\n\nThis of course is a brazen lie.\n\nThe Daily Mail obtained an email revealing Joe Biden paid for Hunter Biden’s legal bill for a deal with Communist China.\n\nA newly released email from 2019 shows Hunter Biden’s assistant Katie Dodge telling book-keeper Linda Shapero and Biden aide Richard Ruffner that Joe Biden agreed to pay Hunter’s legal bills that amounted to more than $730,000.\n\nJoe Biden also had $5.2 million in unexplained income, according to documents reviewed by the Daily Mail.', 'image': 'https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_7230.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:34'}

Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) and Mike Braun (R-Ind.) at an April 26 Senate Committee on Appropriations hearing.\n\n“As I said during my nomination hearing, the investigation is being run by and supervised by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware. He [David Weiss] is supervising the investigation, and I’m not at liberty to talk about internal DOJ deliberations—but he is in charge of that investigation, and there will not be interference of any political or improper kind,” Garland said, also declining to comment on whether other senior DOJ officials have been briefed.\n\nHagerty expressed skepticism at Garland’s promise, given recent statements from the White House regarding Hunter Biden’s innocence.\n\n“I wonder why the president is resorting to go to TV and … his surrogates. Earlier this month, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain said on TV that the president is confident that his son didn’t break the law, and the White House communications director said President Biden maintains his position that his son did nothing that was unethical,” Hagerty said.\n\nThe senator asked Garland whether U.S. President Joe Biden had told him his son is innocent.\n\n“Absolutely not,” Garland responded. “He has not done that, and he has committed to not interfere in the investigation.”\n\nHagerty pressed further, asking Garland how the public could be confident there won’t be political interference in the investigation.\n\n“Because we put a Trump appointee in charge of the investigation,” Garland said, referring to Weiss. “And because you have me as attorney general, who’s committed to the independence of the DOJ from any influence from the White House.”\n\nHagerty then asked Garland whether the DOJ was considering assigning a special counsel to investigate Hunter Biden. Garland again declined to comment.\n\nWhen asked under what circumstances a special counsel would be used in the investigation, Garland said, “it depends on the circumstances.”\n\nBraun asked similar questions about a potential special counsel and received similar responses.\n\n“The question is an internal DOJ matter,” Garland repeated. “I don’t want to make judgments, but I’m comfortable with the Attorney from Delaware continuing.”\n\nThe federal investigation into Hunter Biden’s finances was revealed in December 2020, and few updates have been provided since then.\n\nAttorney Clint Lancaster, who represented an Arkansas woman who filed the lawsuit in 2019 alleging that Hunter Biden was the father of her daughter Navy Joan Roberts, told CBS News earlier this month that federal prosecutors subpoenaed the documents from his case.\n\n“They wanted every record relating to Hunter Biden we had,” he said of the paternity case, which was settled in 2020.\n\nLancaster said the records included Hunter Biden’s “affidavit of financial means” during the paternity lawsuit. A financial affidavit is generally a statement showing income, expenses, assets, and liabilities.\n\nAdditionally, he said the tax records he and Roberts provided overlapped during the same time period as Hunter Biden’s foreign business activities.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/1.tagreuters.com2022binary_LYNXNPEI3510J-FILEDIMAGE-1200x833.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:47'}

Bill Hagerty (R-TN) asked Garland if he knew of the probe into the president’s son. Garland refused to reveal any internal deliberations against Hunter but noted the investigation is being run by David Weiss, a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nWeiss, a 20-year federal prosecutor, will have to determine if there is enough evidence to seek a federal grand jury indictment against Hunter Biden in an investigation that may end up including other members of the Biden family, such as Joe Biden’s brother James Biden, and potentially the president himself.\n\n“I’m aware of that, but he reports to you,” Hagerty pressed about the investigation under Weiss.\n\n“He is supervising the investigation and I’m not at liberty to talk about internal Justice Department deliberations, but he is in charge of that investigation,” Garland reiterated.\n\nGarland then promised the Biden administration would not interfere in the investigation. “There will not be interference of any political or improper kind.”\n\nHagerty continued his line of questioning by asking if Joe Biden ever told Garland that Hunter did not break any laws, including tax fraud, money laundering, and violation of lobbying laws.\n\n“Absolutely not. And the President has not done that. And the President is committed not to interfere, not only in that investigation but any other kind of investigation,” Garland claimed.\n\nLater in the hearing, Garland refused to say whether a special counsel should be placed over the investigation to maintain a just investigation. A special counsel would provide a degree of separation between Biden’s administration and the investigation. Legal experts have said a special counsel is necessary because Joe Biden has denied any wrongdoing by Hunter and may have influenced the ongoing investigation.\n\n“The question of whether they have a special counsel is one that is an internal decision-making within the department, so I don’t want to make any judgments one way or the other,” Garland responded. “But I’m quite comfortable with the United States attorney for that district continuing in the role that he’s [Weiss] playing.”\n\nDuring the 2020 presidential debate, Joe Biden claimed Hunter’s “laptop from hell” was a Russian plant “and a smear campaign.” Joe Biden has repeatedly claimed he was never involved in the family business.\n\nJoe Biden said the emails on Hunter’s laptop were a “Russian plant” and “a smear campaign.” Today new emails indicate that Biden was PAYING Hunter’s bills for a deal with a Chinese government-controlled entity. pic.twitter.com/K3Ojf3SyIg — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) April 26, 2022\n\nBut according to White House visitor logs obtained by the New York Post on Saturday, Hunter’s corrupt business partner, Eric Schwerin, met with Joe Biden at the White House 19 times between 2009 and 2015.

Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.) told reporters following the meeting.\n\n“We are in a different position now than we were in the past,” he said. “There’s ample vaccines available. There is the ability to test and quarantine that work. And so, Title 42 should be lifted, and that we should focus on border management policy in order to make sure that they have the resources in order to move forward.”\n\nBut the administration’s plans to stop enforcing Title 42 were thrown into doubt as the meeting came to a close. A Trump-appointed federal judge in Louisiana said he planned to block the administration’s plans for rescinding the public health order, a win for a group of GOP-led states who sued to stop Biden from moving forward.\n\nThe meeting punctuated internal disagreement in the Democratic Party around the Biden administration’s decision to end enforcement of the Title 42 authority, a public health order that allows border officials to speedily turn away migrants at the U.S. southern border.\n\nImmigration advocates have a litany of concerns about the policy, but at the center of those issues is that it allows officials to forego asylum screenings, blocking persecuted migrants from exercising a right they have under U.S. law.\n\nWhile many support the Biden administration’s decision and indeed wish it had come sooner, others have expressed concern about the plans amid a prolonged spike in border crossings.\n\n“Yes they’re listening to the immigration activists, but my question is who’s listening to the men and women in green and in blue and, more importantly, who is listening to the border communities – the sheriffs, the landowners, the rest of the people who live on the border?” Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), who represents a border community and has raised concerns about the policy decision, said on “Fox News Sunday.”\n\nRep. Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.), who was tasked with presenting the group’s position on Title 42 to Biden, said the meeting touched on a series of issues before turning to immigration, an issue that still led coverage of the meeting.\n\n“The reality is when you talk to Latinos they’re talking about the economy, jobs, air pollution, and so the media is talking about things that are divisive,” said Barragán.\n\nBarragán added that the CHC puts more blame over the immigration policy crisis on former President Trump than on Biden.\n\n“The bottom line is this president walked into a tough situation with a prior administration who dismantled the legal immigration system,” she said.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the meeting was part of Biden’s outreach to individual congressional caucuses. Biden has recently met with the Congressional Progressive Caucus as well as other groups in Congress.\n\nAttendees said that it also covered the implementation of the bipartisan infrastructure law, immigration reform, and environmental justice.\n\nAt one point, an aide to the president walked into the room with a note saying the 30-minute meeting had gone on for 62 minutes.\n\nBiden, rather than keep the information to himself, read the note out loud to laughter from the attendees.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House is facing pressure from immigration advocates to forcefully oppose a bill that has attracted support from moderate senators that would delay an end to the enforcement of Title 42. The White House has not taken a position on the legislation.\n\n“I just wish that the Biden administration would stand up and explain what it’s doing and own it,” said Clara Long, associate director at Human Rights Watch who focuses on immigration and border policy.\n\nPsaki again on Monday said it would be up to Congress to make any changes to CDC’s Title 42 enforcement, but she declined to say whether Biden would sign legislation that did so.\n\n“This would be Congress having the discussion. We are continuing to prepare for a May 23 implementation,” Psaki said. “There will be a range of conversations about this over the coming days.”\n\nThe lawsuits filed by GOP-led states seem to be the biggest immediate threat to the administration’s plans. Some have speculated that the White House would like to see the courts thwart their plans in order to take a hot-button political issue off Biden’s plate.\n\n“I think there’s a theory going around that they’re hoping the courts give them a get-out-of-jail-free card,” said Long.\n\nBiden’s approval ratings are particularly low on his handling of immigration.\n\nA Politico/Morning Consult poll conducted earlier this month found that 54 percent of registered voters oppose Biden’s decision to lift Title 42.\n\nBut a different poll conducted in February by Impact Research for the National Immigration Law Center found that 52 percent of likely 2022 voters support ending Title 42 enforcement.\n\nStill, most CHC members believe that the administration can push forward with its vision of border policy, because Republicans are unlikely to relent from attacking Biden on immigration and the border.\n\n“No matter what the president does, they’re going to make noise. The president and the Democratic-controlled Congress have done amazing things, that’s why econ has improved,” said Rep. Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.), who attended the meeting.\n\n“Republicans don’t want to focus on the glass that’s half full, they want to convince us the glass is half empty,” he added.\n\nSome advocates for ending the policy, which they say represented one prong of the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant agenda, argue that Democrats are risking turning off their base by voicing support for continuing the policy.\n\n“This is a policy that can help you win and the flipside of that is embracing the Republican talking points is not going to help you win those Democratic voters that you desperately need to turn out for you in November,” said Bri Gillis, political director of the National Immigration Law Center’s Immigrant Justice Fund.\n\nStill, some Democrats say the discussion of Title 42 is moot.\n\n“There’s nothing to debate, you’re either for Title 42 or you’re not,” said Rep. Lou Correa (D-Calif.), a CHC member who did not attend the meeting.\n\n“Everybody’s talking abt Title 42 when that’s not the issue. The real issue is American industrial might, nearshoring of American jobs from China, creating a stronger manufacturing base, and a lot of that relies on immigrants. And we’re talking about Title 42. Doesn’t even come close to addressing the bigger public policy issues in this country and that’s what everybody’s talking about. And it’s hurting us,” said Correa.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/ruizraul_031821gn_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:41'}

They stole this election. We all know. They will destroy our country next.”\n\nThe message about Trump potentially invoking martial law, earlier reported by CNN on Monday and confirmed by the Guardian, came a month after the idea had been raised in a heated Oval Office meeting a month before, where Trump considered ways to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nMeadows did not appear to respond to Greene’s text. But the messages Trump’s top White House aide was receiving shows the extraordinary ideas swirling around Trump after he and his operatives were unable to stop the certification of Biden’s election win on January 6.\n\nGreene – one of Trump’s fiercest far-right defenders on Capitol Hill – also texted Meadows days before the Capitol attack asking about how to prepare for objections to Biden’s win at the joint session of Congress, the text messages show.\n\n“Good morning Mark, I’m here in DC. We have to get organized for the 6th,” Greene wrote on 31 December. “I would like to meet with Rudy Giuliani again. We didn’t get to speak with him long. Also anyone who can help. We are getting a lot of members on board.”\n\nThat text message from Greene, who had not yet been sworn in as a member of Congress, a week before the Capitol attack also underscores her close relationship with the Trump White House and an extraordinary level of coordination to obstruct Biden being certified as president.\n\nBut the text messages that Meadows did not turn over to the select committee – as opposed to the communications he agreed to produce for the investigation – were perhaps more notable as the panel investigates connections between the White House and the Capitol attack.\n\nThe panel is aware, for instance, that Meadows had contacts through December 2020 and January 2021 with organizers of the Save America rally at the Ellipse that descended into the Capitol attack as well as with Trump campaign officials, say sources close to the inquiry.\n\nYet none of the text messages Meadows produced to the select committee through a cooperation deal agreed last year and in response to a subpoena show any such contacts, raising the specter that he might have deliberately withheld some communications.\n\nThe former White House chief of staff appears to have ultimately turned over no text messages between 9 December and 21 December, a critical time period in the lead-up to the Capitol attack during which a number of key moments took place.\n\nMeadows appeared to be aware of efforts by the White House and others, for instance, to send fake Trump slates of electors to Congress. The idea was to have “dueling” slates of electors force then-vice president Mike Pence to discount those votes and return Trump to office.\n\nThat scheme – which the select committee believes was coordinated in part by the Trump White House, the sources said – appeared to occur on 14 December, the deadline under the Electoral Count Act for states to send electoral college votes to Congress.\n\nMeadows also was in close contact with Trump’s attorney Rudy Giuliani and others after the contentious Oval Office meeting with Trump on 18 December, as he sought to bar onetime Trump campaign lawyer and conspiracy theorist Sidney Powell from the White House.\n\nBut Meadows appears to have turned over no text messages from that crucial period, as allies of the former president started to set their sights on January 6, including the Stop the Steal movement that started to plan a protest at the Capitol around that time.\n\nThe seeming omission may be explained in part by the fact that Meadows was communicating about those plans on his personal cell phone – against which the select committee issued a subpoena contested by Meadows in federal court as “overly broad”.\n\nThe absence of messages between 9 December and 21 December may also be explained more straightforwardly by the fact that Meadows did not receive any messages during that period. Meadows’ lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nHouse investigators are not convinced they have been given all the text messages relevant to their subpoena, according to one source with knowledge of the matter, and expect to continue pursuing Meadows’ documents and personal communications in court.\n\nIn a motion for summary judgment with respect to Meadows’ records, the select committee said in a 248-page court filing late on Friday that it believed Meadows’ claims for withholding material from the investigation on grounds of executive privilege were baseless.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfe079c4faec28229651078fa1ef1445f13623c9/0_149_4504_2704/master/4504.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bb0615f20d2d295d9c507d24a68b0912', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:54'}

Former President Barack Obama issued 212 pardons and commuted 1,715 sentences over two terms.\n\nAnother pardon recipient is Betty Jo Bogans, 51, a single mom from Houston.

The shots greatly diminish the chances of her becoming seriously ill. When former President Trump, 75, was hospitalized with COVID-19 in October 2020, he was at much higher risk, given his age and the lack of available vaccines. Trump has said he has since been vaccinated and boosted.\n\nWhite House officials have said that they expect Biden will catch the virus, but he has not been avoiding events with crowds. He is scheduled to attend the White House Correspondents Assn. dinner Saturday and to speak at a memorial service Sunday for former Vice President Walter Mondale in Minneapolis.\n\n“Like many Americans, he makes risk assessments,” Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.\n\nHarris had initially planned to return to Washington from California, where she took some personal time and gave a speech about anti-satellite missiles and another about maternal health, on Tuesday. Her office would not say why she altered her travel plans to return a day earlier but noted that she was not experiencing any symptoms before testing positive.\n\nBecause she had not been expected in Washington until Tuesday, Harris had a light schedule, with no meetings in the morning and no public events all day, said Allen, the spokeswoman.\n\nHarris took a rapid antigen test Tuesday morning after going to work at the White House, Allen said. After that test came back positive, Allen said, Harris took a PCR test, a more accurate assessment that confirmed the rapid result. Harris left the White House for her residence at the U.S. Naval Observatory by motorcade.\n\nBiden and Harris later spoke by phone. “He wanted to check in and make sure she has everything she needs as she quarantines at home,” the White House said in a statement.\n\nThough Harris did not attend any formal meetings, the White House is still tracing her contacts to determine who may have been exposed to her. Even when they are not in formal meetings, vice presidents interact with an array of policy, communications and personal staff.\n\n“Should we identify a close a close contact, we will notify them as appropriate,” Allen said.\n\nHer office is also going through her schedule to see which public events and private meetings need to be canceled or shifted to a virtual setting.\n\nHarris plans to work from her residence for at least five days and will not return to the White House until she receives a negative test. Allen declined to say whether Harris would be taking any medication, adding that such decisions would be left to White House physicians.\n\nThe latest wave of COVID, sparked by the Omicron BA. 2 subvariants, has swept through official Washington in recent weeks, infecting many members of Congress and the executive branch. The White House rhetoric has shifted from preventing infections to promoting vaccines, boosters and therapeutics.\n\n“It is going to be hard to ensure that no one gets COVID in America,” Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House’s coronavirus coordinator, told reporters Tuesday. “That’s not even a policy. The goal of our policy should be obviously to minimize infections whenever possible, but to make sure people don’t get seriously ill. The best ways of doing that are make sure people are vaccinated and boosted as the vice president is and making sure we have plenty of therapeutics.”\n\nMinutes after Harris announced her result, two Democratic members of the Senate — Ron Wyden of Oregon and Chris Murphy of Connecticut — announced they too had contracted what they believed to be mild forms of the virus.\n\n“It’s a bummer, but I’m sure if I wasn’t fully vaccinated I would be feeling a lot worse. So remember to get your booster!” Murphy tweeted.\n\nSimmons, Harris’ communications director, tested positive for the virus after attending the April 2 Gridiron dinner, a traditional white-tie gathering of reporters and politicians that features light roasts and songs.\n\nAtty. Gen. Merrick Garland and Gina Raimondo, the secretary of Commerce, announced positive test results following the dinner, as did Reps. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank) and Joaquin Castro (D-Texas).\n\nAll of them had been vaccinated, and none became seriously ill.\n\nHarris’ positive tests come as the administration has tried to push the country toward normalcy, eliminating mask requirements in many settings and returning to public gatherings. A federal judge in Florida took it a step further last week, overturning a federal requirement to wear masks on airplanes, trains and buses. The administration is appealing that ruling.\n\n“None of us can predict with any certainty where exactly this pandemic is going, what the virus is going to do next. All we can do is prepare,” Jha said, urging Congress to pass another round of funding to combat the virus.\n\nStaff writer Eli Stokols contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n', 'image': 'https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ab3b3ac/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffb%2Fff%2Fcfc38a794c329c2a8d3684ababb9%2F947026-na-pol-0421-vp-cali-trip-kkn-25884.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:57'}

Kyrsten Sinema has confounded Democrats over budget talks – even while boasting about using her cleavage to reel in 'uptight' Republicans, according to a new book.\n\nSinema, a weight-lifter and fitness buff, regularly draws attention in the buttoned-down Senate hallways with her eclectic fashion choices.\n\nBut she has also developed ways to contend with Republicans in the minority, according to This Will Not Pass, a new book by New York Times reporters Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns.\n\nDespite being more 'discomfiting' to the White House than any Democrat in the 50-50 Senate, Sinema had relationships across the political aisle. The former House member, who is the first bisexual member of the Senate, 'joked with Democrats about how easy it was for her to charm Republican men,' according to the book.\n\n'Sinema, a fitness enthusiast who was 36 when she entered Congress, boasted knowingly to colleagues and aides that her cleavage had an extraordinary persuasive effect on the uptight men of the GOP. She told one House Republican that while she would never switch parties, her father would be delighted if she did,' the authors write.\n\nSen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) 'boasted knowingly to colleagues and aides that her cleavage had an extraordinary persuasive effect on the uptight men of the GOP,' according to a new book\n\nThe book also delves into President Joe Biden's governing woes – including prolonged talks with Sinema, whom the authors dub an 'aloof Arizonan.' She became a progressive nemesis when she and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) wouldn't go along with Biden's multi-trillion proposals, although she did cheer his infrastructure plan.\n\nAfter Biden signed the infrastructure bill, Sinema asked Biden's aides not to send the president to her home state for a 'victory lap,' even though he had won Arizona in 2020. White House aides were concluding she was 'simply a difficult person.'\n\nThe book describes one early 2021 dinner with Senate Republicans after the election where where the Republicans asked Sinema to join – and she requested to be able to enter through a back door to avoid being seen.\n\nShe has won praise from Republicans for her opposition to changing the Senate filibuster, and a line of Republicans congratulated her on the Senate floor after voting with the GOP on a move to advance the Democratic leadership backed voting rights legislation.\n\nThe book, which grabbed headlines with revelations about House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, also contains details about former President Donald Trump and his election overturn effort.\n\nSinema confounded Democrats during months-long negotiations\n\nSinema previously served in the House. Here, she and Trey Hollingsworth, R-Ind., talk before a House Financial Services Committee hearing in 2018\n\nSinema asked Biden's aides not to send the president to her home state for a 'victory lap' after Biden signed the infrastructure bill, according to the book\n\nTrump's belief that he could prevail extended well after the time he left the White House and decamped to Mar-a-Lago.\n\nAnd it wasn't just Donald Trump's most passionate adherents who believed in the 'reinstatement' myth – the former President himself was saying last spring he would be reinstalled within months, the book reveals.\n\nTrump stated his belief in the theory in May of 2021, four months after leaving office, according to the book.\n\nThe idea of a Trump reinstatement was being promoted at the time by My Pillow exec Mike Lindell and QAnon adherents, although it would ultimately be believed by nearly a third of Republicans in a June Politico / Morning Consult survey.\n\nTrump phoned National Review editor Rich Lowry to tell him that the magazine 'would take off like a rocket if it recognized that he had actually won the election,' according to the book.\n\n'In fact, Trump told Lowry, he expected to be reinstated by August, and Republicans would be put back in charge of the Senate once the supposedly pervasive corruption of the 2020 election was exposed.'\n\nFormer President Donald Trump told columnist Rich Lowry in May 2021 he expected to be reinstated within months, according to a new book\n\nThe Senate had flipped to Democratic control in 2000 after two Democratic wins in Georgia.\n\nThere is no provision in the Constitution for 'reinstatement' once election results have been certified by the states and Congress has counted the electoral votes and the president and lawmakers have been sworn into office.\n\n(Lowry may have been an odd target for Trump's lobbying. He had called the Capitol riot in a Jan. 6th column a 'disgrace,' where he wrote that 'one point of the riot was to further pressure Pence (“Hang Mike Pence!”), but much of the lobbying took place behind closed doors, among Trump’s advisers.')\n\nTrump also took a shot at now Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. 'It was beyond belief, Trump said, that Mitch McConnell did not seem to understand this,' according to the book.\n\n'The president's comments were pure madness,' the authors write.\n\nCongress ultimately counted the votes certified by the states following the Capitol riot. Joe Biden took the oath Jan. 20th after Trump left the White House\n\nTrump has been spending time at Mar-a-Lago and holding rallies around the country while dangling the possibility of a return to the White House\n\nThere have been multiple reports on Trump's interest in getting 'reinstated.'\n\nAfter Trump withdrew his endorsement of Alabama GOP Rep. Mo Brooks, Brooks released a statement saying Trump had approached him with the idea.\n\n'President Trump asked me to rescind the 2020 elections, immediately remove Joe Biden from the White House, immediately put President Trump back in the White House, and hold a new special election for the presidency,' Brooks said in a statement.\n\n'As a lawyer, I’ve repeatedly advised President Trump that January 6 was the final election contest verdict and neither the U.S. Constitution nor the U.S. Code permit what President Trump asks. Period,' he added.\n\n'I’ve told President Trump the truth knowing full well that it might cause President Trump to rescind his endorsement. But I took a sworn oath to defend and protect the U.S. Constitution. I honor my oath. That is the way I am. I break my sworn oath for no man.'\n\nTrump took back his endorsement in the Alabama Senate primary, citing Brooks' call for people to put the 2020 election 'behind you.'\n\nLindell, who was advised Trump inside the White House in the last days of his presidency, has also repeatedly touted the idea.\n\nOther passages in the book reveal how Vice President Kamala Harris quickly learned not to come between President Biden and his negotiations with Congress.\n\nThe authors recount one episode where the president snapped at her so harshly even Republican senators in the meeting were shocked.\n\nIn a meeting last May, Biden tried to persuade Republican lawmakers to support $1 trillion in infrastructure spending.\n\nAnd while Biden was ready for a compromise, Harris thought the bill was skimpy.\n\n'Harris thought that there was something missing from the conversation,' according to the book.\n\nShe began turning the conversation toward Democratic priorities, including family and social spending, which were originally included in the larger Build Back Better bill.\n\nShe 'began to make the case for a larger package than the one Republicans seemed to have in mind.'\n\n'Biden dismissed her comment immediately,' the authors wrote, in so harsh a tone 'that even the Republican senators were taken aback.'\n\nBiden was typically 'scrupulously respectful' of his second-in-command, but the moment revealed that infrastructure negotiations were his and his alone.", 'image': 'https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/26/17/57074033-0-image-a-35_1650989503049.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:57:00'}

After news of Musk’s takeover, news website Politico contacted several top Republican members and aides to gauge reaction to a potential Trump Twitter return.\n\n“Every single one of them told us that they hoped the former president stays the hell away from Twitter,” Politico reported.\n\nTrump himself has said he won’t be back, telling Fox News: “I am going to be staying on Truth.”\n\nThe twice-impeached former commander-in-chief is not known for his consistency, however. He has reportedly expressed discontent with how Truth Social has performed – “What the fuck is going on,” the Daily Beast reported Trump as asking aides in March – and to return to relevance, and to win back the spotlight he craves, the former president might need Twitter.\n\n“If he wants to intervene on behalf of a candidate he has now endorsed in the midterm elections, being able to reach that number of people with messages supporting those candidates is a way of essentially getting free advertising time to reach people who are more likely to vote as a result of getting a signal from Donald Trump,” Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, told Time.\n\nTrump may have insisted that he will snub Twitter and stick with Truth Social, but his commitment to his own platform has so far been tepid at best – Trump has posted on Truth Social just once.\n\nIf that lack of interaction hasn’t helped Truth Social, neither did the botched rollout on 21 February. Tens of thousands of people were unable to access the network – the Guardian was finally allowed in on 5 March – and by early April the Truth Social app was the 355th most popular on Apple devices.\n\nIn terms of daily active users, Truth Social had 513,000, the Daily Beast reported. Twitter has about 217 million.\n\nLack of usage – both by Trump and by the general public – is not the only problem the new network faces.\n\nShares in Digital World Acquisition Corporation, the firm which plans to merge with Trump Media & Technology Group, dropped 13% on Monday after news of Musk’s deal. Since Musk became the largest shareholder in Twitter TMTG shares have fallen by 44% overall, and two key Truth Social executives quit the platform in April.\n\nSince Trump was removed from Twitter his missives have been limited to email blasts sent from his Save America Pac, the messages frequently bleating about a “stolen election” in 2020. At the moment those emails are received by a mixture of supporters and vaguely interested journalists.\n\nIf Trump resumed tweeting, he’d have a far bigger audience for his misinformation – which could have serious consequences.\n\n“The real danger would come after election day,” Gertz said, “when he could use that same megaphone to spread lies about voter fraud as a pretext for overturning elections. If that happens, another January 6 – perhaps a more successful one – is very much in play.”', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a92109698abfe8cebc8ed79f918f6e0cb5a652cf/0_156_5131_3078/master/5131.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0c9734ab4bdc644afa8fecabe2eaf914', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:03'}

But obviously in the case where there’s perhaps a lot of controversy, you would not necessarily want to promote that tweet,” he said.\n\nPreviously, Musk has expressed alarm over Twitter’s content moderation policies, suggesting they’re tantamount to political censorship.\n\nIn recent years, Twitter has fielded criticism from conservatives and others who have said the company has engaged in censoring viewpoints that go against the mainstream.\n\nNotably, former President Donald Trump was suspended from the social media site after the Jan. 6 Capitol breach, coming as Twitter spokespeople claimed he was using the platform to incite violence, although it did not provide evidence for its claims.

Those measures aim to make the services more appealing to advertisers seeking a safe venue, and to better accommodate politicians and regulators arguing that the platforms are responsible for all of their content. But the moves have alienated some users who, like Mr. Musk, say they go overboard.\n\nHow Twitter operates won’t be entirely up to Mr. Musk.\n\n“Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules—regardless of their shareholding,” Thierry Breton, the EU regulator, wrote Tuesday on Twitter. “Mr Musk knows this well.”\n\nMr. Breton expressed confidence that Twitter, under Mr. Musk’s ownership, would conform to the bloc’s new rules, which still need formal approval from the EU Parliament and representatives from EU countries.\n\nMr. Musk’s planned changes at Twitter, and the response, will be closely watched. Twitter is smaller and less profitable than other social-media companies. It claims 217 million so-called monetizable daily users compared with 1.9 billion daily users for Meta Platforms Inc.’s core Facebook platform and a billion-plus monthly users for TikTok. But Twitter users include media personalities, politicians, activists and tech aficionados who help shape social discourse.\n\n“It has influence way beyond its user base and way beyond its valuation, and so we care about it,” said David Kaye, former United Nations special rapporteur focused on free speech and now a law professor at the University of California, Irvine.\n\nTwitter’s existing content policies haven’t brought about huge financial success; it has struggled to deliver consistent profits. Photo: Laura Morton for The Wall Street Journal\n\nMr. Musk, chief executive of Tesla Inc. and Space Exploration Technologies Corp. as well as the world’s richest person, is one of Twitter’s most prominent users, employing the platform for everything from promoting his companies to battling rivals and critics. In Monday’s deal announcement, he said he wants to open up Twitter’s algorithms to public scrutiny, “defeat” spammers and authenticate users’ identities.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Musk said he views “free speech” as that permitted by the law—a far broader definition of what is allowable than most major social networks have adopted. “I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law,” he said in a tweet. “If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect. Therefore, going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people.”\n\nSome industry executives and analysts say Mr. Musk is in for an awakening. Reversing Twitter’s efforts risks stoking advertisers’ worries about the placement of their ads, potentially pushing them toward competitors like Snap Inc. and Meta, said Ben Black, co-head of internet research at Deutsche Bank.\n\nElon Musk struck a deal on Monday to buy Twitter for about $44 billion, moving the world’s richest man a step closer to taking control of the social-media platform. Photo: Ryan Lash/TED Conferences, LLC/AFP via Getty Images\n\n“Do you really want to have your Mercedes-Benz commercial against a beheading?” he said. “If someone falls overboard on a cruise ship, do you want your vacation message being advertised against that content?” He said less moderation could also drive away some users, potentially slowing growth.\n\n“‘Do you really want to have your Mercedes-Benz commercial against a beheading?’” — Ben Black, co-head of internet research at Deutsche Bank\n\nIn the company’s early years, Twitter executives were loath to remove content unless it broke local laws. The platform often took a hands-off approach even to content from officially designated terrorist groups, drawing criticism from researchers, lawmakers and victims’ families.\n\nIt stepped up moderation over the years, removing accounts connected to the terrorist group ISIS in 2014, for example. That accelerated during and after the 2016 U.S. presidential race, which saw a jump in complaints about white nationalists and others using the platform to attack and harass minority users.\n\nOther industry leaders who favored looser policies, including Meta co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, have gradually embraced more intervention. Platforms including Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest Inc. and Reddit Inc. all have added staff or bolstered rules to monitor their content, though each draws the lines differently.\n\nTheir efforts target a range of potentially problematic content, from hate speech and false information about elections to what they see as fringe views on health, along with other issues the platforms consider harmful. Pinterest recently banned posts that it deems to contain misinformation about climate change.\n\nTwitter and other platforms also have systems allowing users to report claims of abuse by other users, which can lead to account suspensions that some of those involved say can be arbitrary or unfair.\n\nMore moderating has required complex, and often confusing, guidelines for employees and users. Such efforts have led to some divisive decisions, including bans by Twitter and Facebook of then-President Donald Trump for posts encouraging the rioters who attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, seeking to halt certification of President Biden’s electoral victory.\n\nThose bans were widely praised on the left and by some Republicans. But Mr. Trump and his supporters blasted it and have backed rival social-media apps with fewer restrictions that so far have gained limited traction, including Parler, Gab, and Gettr, which former Trump adviser Jason Miller launched last year.\n\nMany in the Trump camp have voiced support for Mr. Musk’s planned Twitter acquisition, though Mr. Trump told Fox News on Monday that he doesn’t plan to return to the platform and would instead use his social-media startup, Truth Social.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up Technology A weekly digest of tech reviews, headlines, columns and your questions answered by WSJ's Personal Tech gurus. PREVIEW\n\nDevin Nunes, CEO of Truth Social, lauded Monday’s Twitter deal, though he said he doesn’t see the platform, even under Mr. Musk, as a direct competitor because of their different target audiences. “This is a great, great day,” the Trump ally and former GOP congressman said. “Finally we’re getting some movement in the right direction here in terms of opening the internet back up and giving people their voice back.”\n\nTwitter’s existing policies haven’t brought about huge financial success; it has struggled to deliver consistent profits. And losing advertisers might not be a problem for Mr. Musk. He has said he wants the platform to rely less on advertising—which accounts for about 90% of its revenue, totaling $5.1 billion last year—and to focus more on a subscription business model. The platform currently offers Twitter Blue, a $2.99-a-month subscription service that gives customers access to premium features.\n\nDespite Mr. Trump’s comments Monday, many observers and Twitter employees are focused on Mr. Musk’s handling of the former president’s account as a potential indicator of his plans. During an all-hands meeting on Monday, Twitter CEO Parag Agarwal was asked if the company might reinstate Mr. Trump once Mr. Musk’s ownership is completed. Mr. Agarwal said it wasn’t clear.\n\n—Patience Haggin contributed to this article.\n\nElon Musk and Twitter More coverage of the billionaire's bid for Twitter, selected by editors Latest Developments\n\nWrite to Deepa Seetharaman at Deepa.Seetharaman@wsj.com and Meghan Bobrowsky at Meghan.Bobrowsky@wsj.com", 'image': 'https://images.wsj.net/im-531039/social', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:07'}

He said that the book describes how “populist economic nationalism has arrived as a movement and why we need to embrace it.”\n\nIn 2021, Navarro published the book “In Trump Time: A Journal of America’s Plague Year,” which was ranked as a top-10 bestseller by USA Today and has been a bestseller on Amazon. Navarro previously noted that more than 200,000 copies of “In Trump Time” had been pre-sold, according to distributors, before it was available to the public.\n\nHowever, “In Trump Time” was omitted from The New York Times’ non-fiction bestseller list even though it should have been ranked at least third on the list from Nov. 21, 2021, Navarro said at the time, citing statistics published by Bookscan, the definitive industry source used for book rankings.\n\n“The New York Times in its cancel culture, virtue signaling, fascist world, did not put it on the list,” Navarro told The Epoch Times. “And that had a material harm to the sales of the book because people use that New York Times bestseller list as what we call in economics a ‘signal’ as to whether a book is worthy of purchase. So there was a great grassroots performance by the book itself. But my judgment, if we weren’t in a cancel culture world, we probably would have sold a million copies of that book.”\n\nIn response to Navarro’s allegations, Nicole Taylor, a communications director at The New York Times, told The Epoch Times in an email that the publication’s best-seller lists are “based on a detailed analysis of book sales from a wide range of retailers who provide us with specific and confidential context of their sales each week.”\n\nThe New York Times representative added that “sales data from our confidential panel of reporting stores is separate from what is reported to Bookscan or other entities” and that publication’s “Best Sellers department has reviewed the data they received for the sales week of November 21, 2021 and is confident in the accuracy of the Best-Seller Lists for that week.”\n\nNavarro, in an email response, called The New York Times’ statement a “misdirection,” saying that “In Trump Time” sold over 30,000 books during the week in question. “We sold twice as many books or more as half of the titles that appeared on the list,” he said.\n\nThe former official announced “Taking Back Trump’s America,” which is scheduled for release in September, while guest-hosting Stephen K. Bannon’s “War Room” podcast on April 15, and said “hands down the ‘War Room’ is the most powerful platform to sell thoughtful books to the American public. It really astonishes people, authors, publishers, when they go on the road and see how lettered the audience is.”\n\n“I’m counting also on publications like The Epoch Times,” he said. “My hope is that avid readers of The Epoch Times will embrace ‘Taking Back Trump’s America.’”\n\nNavarro revealed that The Epoch Times will be included in the book, saying, “I talk about The Epoch Times in glowing terms in the ‘Taking Back Trump’s America’ book with respect to how it’s grown rapidly from what was a niche publication to one of the most important international newspapers in the world.”\n\nThe former official projected large gains for the Republicans in November’s midterms, driven by growing dissatisfaction with what he described as increasingly radical Democratic policies.\n\n“I think a safe bet is a 60-seat swing [in favor of the Republican Party], which is similar to what happened to Obama with the Tea Party [movement] and when [Newt] Gingrich came along [in the 1994 midterm elections], but depending on how redistricting goes around the country, that could go as high as 80 and as low as 30 or 40,” Navarro said.\n\n“I think a large portion of the country now is united against the Democrat Party,” he added, describing its performance as showing that “it’s a radical political party.”\n\n“It’s really out of touch in the center of this country.”\n\nDespite Republican Party advantages heading into the midterms, Navarro noted that there are struggles between globalists and nationalists happening within the party.\n\n“It’s also true that there’s an important war going on now within the Republican Party between the party of Davos, Wall Street, multinational corporations that offshore our jobs versus the Trump Republicans who embrace secure borders, embrace fair rather than simply so-called free trade,” he said. “If we simply have a Republican majority with the current leadership in charge, Mitch McConnell in the Senate, Kevin McCarthy in the House, we’re going to have basically the status quo ante, and it will not serve the center of this country.”\n\nNavarro emphasized the distinction between “RINO,” an acronym for “Republican in Name Only,” and “Trump” Republicans.\n\n“The Karl Rove faction, the Wall Street faction, the Liz Cheney faction … Mitch McConnell, [Kevin] McCarthy, they’re all supporting RINO Republicans rather than Trump Republicans,” he said, adding that the Republican primaries will serve as a critical test to determine which camp prevails.\n\nA primary race that Navarro is particularly interested in is the Republican primary race in South Carolina’s 1st Congressional District between Trump-endorsed Katie Arrington and first-term incumbent Nancy Mace. Following the events of Jan. 6, 2021, and in what was her first speech on the floor of the House of Representatives, Mace, who had worked on the 2016 Trump campaign, blamed the president for the breach of the Capitol. A story was also posted to her official Congressional website that included “Mace Condemns President Trump” in the headline.\n\nMace is a poster child for the RINO, Rove, corporate media effort to stop the Trump movement,” Navarro told The Epoch Times. Trump endorsed primary challenger Katie Arrington in February, calling Mace “an absolutely terrible candidate” who “has been very disloyal to the Republican Party.”\n\nWhen reached for comment, Austin McCubbin, manager for Rep. Mace’s congressional campaign wrote in an e-mailed statement, “Conservative organizations all score Mace as having a near perfect voting record, because she doesn’t sacrifice her principles.”\n\nNavarro, in response, said in an email, “I was in the trenches with Katie Arrington in the Trump administration when we were fighting to save millions of lives at the start of the pandemic and she was a warrior.”\n\n“The only thing you need to know about Mace is she supported the Democrats effort to steal the election from Donald Trump,” he added.\n\nExecutive Privilege\n\nNavarro described how he is protecting executive privilege in the face of intense pressure from the Democrat-majority House committee investigating the events of Jan. 6.\n\nThe Trump aide refused to comply with a subpoena from the House committee, citing executive privilege. In a highly partisan vote this month, the House of Representatives voted to formally ask the Justice Department to prosecute Navarro and another top Trump adviser on criminal contempt charges for not complying with the subpoena.\n\nAfter the November 2020 presidential election when Trump and allies, including Navarro, alleged largescale election irregularities and fraud, Navarro coordinated what he calls the “Green Bay Sweep” strategy with Trump and Stephen Bannon, who previously served as Trump’s chief White House strategist. The Green Bay Sweep Strategy, named after a football play made famous by the Green Bay Packers, involved members of Congress formally contesting election results in six battleground states before the certification of presidential election results on Jan. 6.\n\nNavarro writes in his book “In Trump Time” regarding Jan. 6, “The political and legal beauty of the strategy was this: by law, both the House of Representatives and the Senate must spend up to two hours of debate per state on each requested challenge. For the six battleground states, that would add up to as much as twenty-four hours of nationally televised hearings across the two chambers of Congress. Through these televised proceedings, we would finally be able to short-circuit the crushing censorship of the anti-Trump media and take our case directly to the American people.”\n\nHe also writes of the event, “The goal is not to get the election overturned today. The goal is to subject the ballots—the legal votes of American citizens along with what we believe to be a flood of illegal ballots—to careful scrutiny and investigation.”\n\nNavarro explained his reasons for maintaining privilege during the House committee proceedings, and suggested that the matter may ultimately have to be resolved by the Supreme Court.\n\n“President Trump has asserted executive privilege, number one,” Navarro told The Epoch Times. “Number two, I informed the [House January 6] committee very clearly that it was not my privilege to waive, therefore I could not comply with their subpoena. And I directed them—and this is equally important—I directed them to negotiate directly with [Trump] and his attorneys for any partial or full waiver of the privilege, and then I would be happy to comply if President Trump himself or his attorneys negotiated something with them. It’s not my privilege to waive.”\n\nHe added, “Subsequent to that, the committee colluded either explicitly or tacitly with the Biden White House to do an end run around that direction, and they chose to have Biden take the legal step of waiving President Trump’s privilege in this matter. And that’s where things stand. So, there’s going to be ongoing legal activities related to that … But this is a Supreme Court decision waiting to happen, because the [House Jan. 6] committee itself is acting in an illegal manner.”\n\nThe White House and the House Jan. 6 committee did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nNavarro in late 2020 completed a report, “The Navarro Report,” documenting detailed evidence and statistical receipts of widespread election fraud and irregularities in the 2020 presidential election. He noted this report has never been discredited, despite Democrats and others maintaining that there was no election fraud.\n\n“The central premise of the Jan. 6 committee is that the election was fair. And they simply assert that there was no fraud or irregularities,” Navarro said. “The problem with that is that there is abundant evidence to the contrary, starting with a very extensive and extensively referenced three-volume report I did that explains what that fraud and what those irregularities were, and how and why the Democrats were able to pull off essentially what was a stolen election.”\n\nNavarro also pointed to corporate media turning a blind eye to the Navarro Report and the substantial evidence of fraud in the 2020 presidential election that it details.\n\n“Just as the corporate media ignored purposefully the “In Trump Time” book, which arguably is the best history to date of the Trump White House, they have ignored any reference to the three-volume Navarro Report … The report’s been out there well prior to January 6, and nobody has ever discredited it.”\n\nDefending Against China\n\nThe former official described the Biden administration’s handling of its relationship with the Chinese regime as “total appeasement.”\n\n“I’m very, very concerned that the weakness that Biden showed Putin has resulted in the invasion of Ukraine. The weakness that Biden is showing Xi Jinping may result in an invasion of Taiwan,” he said.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nNavarro, who has authored books including “The Coming China Wars,” “Death By China,” and “Crouching Tiger: What China’s Militarism Means for the World,” is known for his strong defense of the United States against totalitarian China’s aggression, and was one of the chief architects of the Trump administration’s tough trade policies with respect to Beijing. Trump slapped nearly $360 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods during his presidency.\n\nIn the Trump White House, Navarro identified the Chinese Communist Party’s “seven deadly sins” of economic aggression, including cyber hacking to steal trade secrets, intellectual property theft, forced technology transfer, below-cost dumping of products into American markets, the use of heavily subsidized state-owned enterprises that employ predatory pricing, currency manipulation, and the flooding of American communities with fentanyl and other opioids.\n\nWhen asked about what the United States should do now to continue to defend against totalitarian China’s aggression, Navarro stated, “We were ready in a second [Trump administration] term to really up the tariffs.”\n\nHe continued, “I think something that would be a perfect complement to tariffs would be a complete cutting off of capital flows from America to China. It’s crazy that our pension funds, for example, are supporting companies in China that make weapons, for example. We tried to stop that.”\n\nIn November 2020, Trump issued an executive order prohibiting purchases by American investors of stocks in companies determined by the US Defense Department to be owned or controlled by the Chinese military. In June 2021, the Biden administration replaced this order with a revised version that in some ways expanded upon the original, including by widening the scope of Chinese companies that could be sanctioned.\n\nNavarro said that “China is an existential threat to the country,” and added, “My view is and has long been that we should stop doing any kind of business with them until they cease their economic aggressions. Geopolitical, revanchist, and imperialist aggression.”\n\nPointing to the need for America to show strength in the face of totalitarian China’s continuing and intensifying aggression, Navarro said, “Strength invites peace, weakness invites war.”', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2021/01/28/CPAC_2019_9A6A5372-1-1200x800.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:57'}

Twitter has taken modest but wildly inadequate steps to improve safety on the platform. It has acknowledged it has a problem. It has recognized positive freedom of speech — the creation of a safe and non-life-ruining environment for the airing of thoughts. And it is this that Mr. Musk and his ilk seem to loathe.\n\nThis is why his deal to purchase Twitter is so dangerous. In recent years, there has been progress toward positive freedom of speech — real work to give everyone, truly everyone, more meaningful occasion to speak. Mr. Musk apparently wants to shut that down. Instead, in a moment of proto-fascism on the political right, his priority seems to be to undam the flood of bile and bigotry and bullying and disinformation.\n\nThe country already faces the very real prospect, starting at noon on Jan. 20, 2025, of a descent toward racist authoritarianism and a protracted slide away from liberal democracy. If your idea of what the country needs in this moment is less clamping down on hate and lies and more rightists gone wild, whew.\n\nThe plutocrats have already rigged the economy. That’s just the first step. Then you take some of the spoils and reinvest it in buying even more political influence, so that political inequality can help keep economic inequality yawning. You buy up media or social media platforms and thus can help rig the discourse in your favor, taking control of the tools used by regular people to fight back. You venture, as Mr. Musk did, to a TED conference and, without much pushback, brand yourself as a kind of public intellectual, a thought leader, a visionary, and thereby in many people’s minds you became a sage, not a robber baron.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be this way. We can have nice things. But we’re going to have to learn to see through the fraudulent stories that elevate figures like Mr. Musk into heroes. We’re going to have to legislate real guardrails — perhaps like those created by the European Union’s Digital Services Act — on social media platforms that are too big to entrust democracy to. We’re going to have to build nonprofit alternatives to the platforms and see if they can become meaningful venues.', 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/26/opinion/26giridharadas_2/26giridharadas_2-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:56'}

Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency created as a 'joke' in 2013. Its mascot is a Shiba Inu dog, made popular from the 'doge' meme featuring photos of the canine overlaid with text written in broken English. It can be bought or sold on crypto exchanges like Coinbase or on trading apps like Robinhood and Webull. One Dogecoin is worth 16 cents as of Tuesday morning. It's never been worth more than 64 cents. Creator Billy Markus said last year that he invented the coin as a joke.

It feels silly, but there's this huge upwelling behind it.'

Co-founder Jack Dorsey (right) holds a board seat, but is expected to give it up in May\n\nMusk is known for using Twitter to post inflammatory messages, much like former President Donald Trump.\n\nParag Agrawal, the CEO, said on Monday that it was up to Musk to decide whether to readmit Trump.\n\nTrump on Monday said he would not be rejoining the site if Musk allowed him to - instead saying he would continue to use his own TRUTH Social.\n\nSome experts are pointing to a tough road ahead for Twitter if Musk, who calls himself a free speech absolutist, gets his way.\n\n'We expect advertisers will be less willing to spend on Twitter if Elon Musk removes content moderation in order to promote free speech,' MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson said.\n\nThe 16-year old company, which has emerged as one of the world's most influential online public squares with about over 200 million users, reported $4.51 billion in ad revenue for 2021, accounting for about 89% of its overall sales.\n\n'The challenge (for Twitter) will be maintaining and building revenue given that the controversial opinions (Musk) hopes to give more of a free rein to are often unpalatable to advertisers,' Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Susannah Streeter said.\n\nTesla tycoon versus Big Tech: How swashbuckling billionaire Elon Musk fought off 'poison pill', lawsuits and hostile board of directors before $44bn Twitter takeover\n\nIt has been one of the most dramatic takeover attempts in history, seeing a swashbuckling billionaire pitted against one of the largest tech giants in the world.\n\nBut Elon Musk's seizing of Twitter has been a months-long pursuit that has seen him send shockwaves through the world of business.\n\nThe Tesla magnate started hoarding shares in the social media firm at the start of the year in an apparent bid to preserve free speech online.\n\nHe quickly rocketed to the top of its shareholders' list, acquiring a huge 9% stake in the tech giant.\n\nBut then he hit choppy waters, accepting a place on the board then rejecting it, getting embroiled in lawsuits and seeing rival companies circle to buy Twitter.\n\nMeanwhile bosses at the social media firm appeared to do all they could to ensure he could not not seize it - even launching a 'poison pill' strategy to sink his chances.\n\nYet Musk brazenly blasted through all the obstacles, punting a $43 billion offer earlier this month and showing how he would finance it.\n\nThe two sides were reportedly working into the early morning on Monday to finalize the 'fast-moving' negotiations.\n\nIt saw Twitter shares in the US soar by four percent as the markets opened to $50.84 a share.\n\nOn Monday, Musk called for his 'worst critics' to remain on the platform because 'that is what free speech means'.\n\nHere, DailyMail.com looks at the rollercoaster journey he has been on over the last few months as he seizes his prize.\n\n\n\nThe Tesla magnate started hoarding shares in the social media firm at the start of the year in an apparent bid to preserve free speech online\n\nJanuary 31: Musk hoards Twitter shares and buys them 'almost daily'\n\nMusk started buying Twitter stock on January 31 and continued to buy shares during every trading session through April 1, according to an SEC filing.\n\nJust days earlier, he told his 80 million followers on the site he was ' giving serious thought ' to creating his own social media platform.\n\nA user asked him: 'Would you consider building a new social media platform, @elonmusk?\n\n'One that would consist an open source algorithm, one where free speech and adhering to free speech is given top priority, one where propaganda is very minimal. I think that kind of a platform is needed.'\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO replied through his official account: 'Am giving serious thought to this.'\n\nThe billionaire businessman, 50, appeared to be suggesting he was sick of Twitter over the right to freedom of speech.\n\nApril 4: Musk says he bought 9.2 percent stake in firm a month earlier\n\nMusk revealed he had purchased a 9.2 percent stake in the social media giant on March 14.\n\nHe tweeted 'oh hi lol' after the news sent shockwaves through the business world and across social media. He added: 'Do you want an edit button?'\n\nApril 5: He joins Twitter's board of directors - sees share price rocket\n\nTwitter said the tech tycoon was joining the company's board of directors, causing the social media platform's shares to rise over 7 per cent in premarket trading.\n\nIt led to speculation he would try to address what he called the platform's 'failure to adhere to free speech principles' and 'fundamentally undermine democracy'.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Musk would have served on the board until the company's 2024 annual shareholders meeting.\n\nAs long as he remains a director, the agreement said, he could not won more than 14.9 percent of the company's stock.\n\nIt meant he would not have been able to take over the company until well after his term on the board was over.\n\nThe firm said: 'Twitter is committed to impartiality in the development and enforcement of its policies and rules.\n\n'Our policy decisions are not determined by the Board or shareholders, and we have no plans to reverse any policy decisions.'\n\n'As always our Board plays an important advisory and feedback role across the entirety of our service.\n\n'Our day to day operations and decisions are made by Twitter management and employees.'\n\nApril 8: Asset managers take over Musk as largest shareholders\n\nAsset manager Vanguard Group increased its stake to overtake Musk as the largest shareholder.\n\nVanguard owned 10.3 percent of Twitter, while the Tesla tycoon owned 9.1 per cent, making him the largest individual shareholder.\n\nVanguard, led by CEO Tim Buckley, increased its stake in the company at some point during the first quarter, according to SEC filings made on April 8.\n\nIt previously reported owning 67.2million shares of Twitter or about 8.4 per cent of the company as of the end of December, according to FactSet.\n\nOther owners of large quantities of Twitter stock included Morgan Stanley, Fidelity and Black Rock.\n\nVanguard, led by CEO Tim Buckley, increased its stake in the company at some point during the first quarter, according to SEC filings made on April 8\n\nApril 9: Musk rejects the offer to join Twitter's board of directors\n\nMusk rejected an offer to join Twitter's board after disclosing his stake in the company.\n\nAnalysts said the move signaled his intention to take over the company as a board seat would have limited his stake to just under 15 per cent.\n\nParag Agrawal said the board would still 'remain open' to Musk's input, but warned: 'There will be distractions ahead but our goals and priorities remain unchanged.'\n\nHe said: 'The board and I had many discussions about Elon joining the board, and with Elon directly. We were excited to collaborate and clear about the risks.\n\n'We also believed that having Elon as a fiduciary of the company where he, like all board members, has to act in the best interests of the company and all our shareholders, was the best path forward. The board offered him a seat.'\n\nAgrawal continued: 'We announced on Tuesday that Elon would be appointed to the board contingent on a background check and formal acceptance.\n\n'Elon's appointment to the board was to become officially effective 4/9, but Elon shared that same morning that he will no longer be joining the board.'\n\nParag Agrawal said the board would still 'remain open' to Musk's input, but warned: 'There will be distractions ahead but our goals and priorities remain unchanged'\n\nApril 12: Twitter shareholder Marc Bain Rasella files suit against Musk\n\nMarc Bain Rasella filed a lawsuit against Musk for alleged securities fraud at a Manhattan federal court, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nThe suit claimed the billionaire was required to disclose his holdings to the SEC by March 24, but the delay kept Twitter's share price down allowing Musk to buy more.\n\nMusk was accused of violating a regulatory deadline to reveal he had accumulated a stake of at least five per cent.\n\nInstead, according to the complaint, Musk did not disclose his position in Twitter until he had almost doubled his stake to more than nine per cent.\n\nThat strategy, the lawsuit alleges, hurt less wealthy investors who sold shares in the company in the nearly two weeks before Musk acknowledged holding a major stake.\n\nApril 14: The Tesla tycoon offers to buy Twitter for $43 BILLION\n\nMusk offered to buy Twitter for $43billion, a regulatory filing showed, as he moved to seize the social media giant.\n\nMusk's offer price of $54.20 per share represented a 38 per cent premium to the closing price of Twitter's stock on April 1.\n\nThis was the last trading day before the Tesla CEO's over nine per cent investment in the company was publicly announced.\n\nIt even appeared to reference marijuana - also known as 420 - a common reference used by Musk on Twitter.\n\nTwitter said in a regulatory filing Musk provided a letter containing a proposal to buy the remaining shares of Twitter he did not already own.\n\nApril 15: Twitter launches 'poison pill' strategy to stop Musk buyout\n\nTwitter's board announced a dramatic poison pill plan to prevent Musk from increasing his stake in the company.\n\nAlso known as a shareholder rights provision, the plan would trigger a dilution of shares if any shareholder builds up a 15 per cent stake without the board's approval.\n\nThe plan did not prevent Twitter from accepting Musk's offer or entering negotiations with him or other potential buyers.\n\nBut it did stop the billionaire from putting pressure on the board by buying up ever more shares on the open market.\n\nMusk hit back with a laughing emoji to a version of the classic 'Distracted Boyfriend' meme mocking Twitter's board.\n\nThe imaged depicted 'Twitter's board' looking wistfully at the option to 'keep that easy gig that gives me shares' as 'Twitter investors' look on with disgust.\n\nTwitter's board is led by chairman Bret Taylor, who is also the co-CEO of business software giant Salesforce\n\nApril 16: Musk tweets Love Me Tender in tease of hostile takeover\n\nMusk tweeted 'Love Me Tender' as he again teased at the possibility of a hostile takeover of Twitter.\n\nThe billionaire posted the Elvis Presley lyrics in a potential bid to lure shareholders with a tender offer that could see him seize control.\n\nA tender offer would see him bypass the board and go to shareholders with his offer of $54.20 a share - but he would need to show how he would finance his bid.\n\nHe also appeared to suggest he would strip board members of their salaries, saying they would get '$0 if my bid succeeds'.\n\nApril 18: Jack Dorsey slams the Twitter board for 'plots and coups'\n\nJack Dorsey slammed the board of Twitter as he weighed into the toxic fight over Elon Musk's attempted hostile takeover for the first time.\n\nThe former CEO, who is still a member of the board himself, blasted the 'plots and coups' that were 'consistently the dysfunction of the company'.\n\nIn a series of bombshell tweets and replies, he endorsed one posting saying that 'a bad board will kill a company every time'.\n\nReplying to one post, he said: 'When I was fired in 2008 and made chair, the board took most of my shares away from me.\n\n'I also gave 1 per cent of the company back to the employee pool in 2015. So, ended up with very little of company.'\n\nHe also replied to one comment mentioning 'plots and coups' in the Twitter board saying: 'it's consistently been the dysfunction of the company'.\n\nEarlier in the thread, he replied to a post quoting a 'Silicon Valley proverb' by venture capitalist Fred Destin.\n\nIt said: 'Good boards don't create good companies, but a bad board will kill a company every time.' Dorsey said: 'Big facts.'\n\nFormer CEO Dorsey slammed Twitter's board of directors on as he replied to a series of unfriendly tweets\n\nApril 21: SpaceX boss unveils his $46.5billion financing package\n\nElon Musk unveiled his $46.5billion financing package to fund his takeover of Twitter - using Tesla as collateral.\n\nThe world's richest man filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission outlining how he would seize the social media giant.\n\nHe committed $21billion in equity, $13billion from Morgan Stanley in debt facilities and another $12.5billion from the bank and others in margin loans.\n\nBut 'a portion' of his shares in Tesla have been put forward as collateral, which analysts feared could have a huge impact on the firm.\n\nThe 50-year-old billionaire also revealed he was weighing up launching a tender offer for Twitter after the company ignored his acquisition offer.\n\nHe said he was exploring getting stocks directly from shareholders but admitted he 'has not determined whether to do so at this time'.\n\nMusk filed the document with the SEC showing how he planned to take over Twitter for about $46.5billion.\n\nHe secured a debt commitment letter from Morgan Stanley Senior Funding to the tune of $13billion in financing.\n\nThis was made up of a loan of $6.5billion, a senior secured revolving facility for $500million, a bridge loan of up to $3billion and an unsecured bridge loan for up to $3billion.\n\nHe also got a margin loan commitment letter from Morgan Stanley for $12.5 billion in margin loans. And Musk also got $21billion through equity financing.\n\nBut he has used 'a portion' of his shares in Tesla as collateral in the high-stakes move, which analysts warned could have huge ramifications for the company.\n\nApril 22: Musk posts 'boner' killer picture of Bill Gates on Twitter\n\nMusk dissed Bill Gates' gut on Twitter, posting a photo of the Microsoft mogul next to Apple's controversial pregnant man emoji 'in case you need to lose a boner.'\n\nHe posted a follow-up image in response to the Friday post of six hooded figured captioned 'shadow ban council reviewing Tweet'.\n\nThe joke could further infuriate woke Twitter staffers angered by Musk's ongoing bid to buy the firm after saying he would support free speech.\n\nThat is because the pregnant man emoji is aimed at being inclusive to transgender people - with Musk frequently taking aim at what he sees as woke overreach.\n\nApril 25: Musk finalizes deal to buy Twitter\n\nMusk was closing in on seizing Twitter as talks between the Tesla magnate and the tech giant entered their final stages, reports say.\n\nThe tycoon's representatives were said to be hammering out terms including a timeline and fees if an agreement was signed and then fell apart.\n\nThe two sides were reportedly working into the early morning to finalize the 'fluid and fast-moving' negotiations.\n\nTwitter shares soared by four percent as the markets opened to $50.84 a share amid reports it would be seized by Musk.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Twitter announced it had 'entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by an entity wholly owned by Elon Musk, for $54.20 per share in cash in a transaction valued at approximately $44 billion. Upon completion of the transaction, Twitter will become a privately held company.'", 'image': 'https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/26/14/57069119-0-image-a-49_1650980561815.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:46'}

That comes as cases and hospitalizations have begun to climb nationwide, driven by the highly-contagious Omicron BA.2 subvariant.\n\nIn New England, federal data has tracked the pace of new COVID-19 hospitalizations surging among patients 70 and older — the age group most vulnerable to severe COVID-19 — since the beginning of April. The rate of new admissions is now higher than the peak reached over the Delta variant wave last year, but remains a fraction of the record highs during the winter Omicron wave.\n\n"We certainly know that there\'s more room to go. We can save more lives by giving this medication to more people," said the official.\n\nGetting Paxlovid antiviral pills\n\nPaxlovid treatment needs to begin within a few days of first developing symptoms.\n\nA course of treatment is made up of three tablets that are taken twice a day, in the morning and evening, over the course of five days, for a total of 30 pills. Initial clinical trials showed the drug reduced the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization or death by 88%, compared to placebo.\n\nPaxlovid cannot be taken at the same time as several medications that can reduce the drug\'s efficacy or lead to potentially fatal side effects.\n\nThrough outreach to doctors and patients, officials say they hope more eligible Americans will act quickly to get the now-plentiful antiviral pills sitting on pharmacy shelves.\n\nPfizer\'s COVID-19 drug Paxlovid Fabian Sommer/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\n"A lot of providers early on in that scarcity mindset, when there were fewer courses available across the country, were really reserving this for only the folks who they thought would be the sickest of the sick," an administration official told reporters.\n\nOn Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health alert urging doctors to step up prescribing of effective COVID-19 treatments — and imploring at-risk patients who test positive not to delay in contacting their doctors, "even if your symptoms are mild."\n\nA "tranche" of more than 100,000 courses of the antiviral pills will be made available to all of the federal government\'s pharmacy partners to order directly, instead of through federal and local allocations. Officials say they expect the move will raise the number of sites with drugs in stock from 20,000 to 30,000.\n\nThat comes on top of efforts like the administration\'s nationwide "test-to-treat initiative" launched at thousands of pharmacies earlier this year.\n\nFollowing concerns that the program was inaccessible to Americans living in many parts of the country, officials said the administration is planning to launch new "federally-supported Test-to-Treat sites" beyond the 2,200 locations currently in the program.\n\n"I think we\'re going to be working really closely with these new federally supported sites, work directly with state, territorial, and jurisdictional leadership to identify the places that need more support," said an administration official.\n\nChallenges and questions\n\nOfficials acknowledged that the new moves do not address some of the criticisms levied against the Biden administration\'s treatment effort.\n\nDespite objections from pharmacy trade groups, the FDA excludes most pharmacists from being able to prescribe Paxlovid or Lagevrio. For at-risk Americans without access to a "test-to-treat" drugstore that has a qualifying provider available, this means some will have to make multiple trips to get the pills.\n\n"You have to develop COVID symptoms, you have to subsequently get a test for COVID-19, get the result of that test, find and go to see a provider, get a prescription, and then fill that prescription. That\'s six steps in five days," said an official.\n\nIt also does not include an expansion to who is eligible to take the drugs under the FDA\'s emergency use authorization.\n\nSpeaking at Uniformed Services University earlier this month, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the president\'s chief medical adviser, hinted that Paxlovid might soon be expanded to lower-risk patients "in order to prevent them possibly from getting long COVID."\n\nBoth Pfizer and Merck have also been running a range of trials that might support expanding use of the antiviral pills to more people. Results could come soon from a trial assessing Paxlovid in people who are exposed to the disease, but have not yet developed symptoms, which was due to be completed earlier this month.\n\nAnd administration officials at the briefing did not bring up growing reports of "rebound" or "relapse" symptoms — people who appear to recover from COVID-19 after taking the antiviral pills, but later get a new round of symptoms — which might lead to SARS-CoV-2 evolving resistance to the treatments.\n\nA spokesperson for Pfizer said the company was continuing to monitor data from their clinical trials of Paxlovid as well as real-world evidence, and has "not seen any resistance" to the drug.\n\nIn a statement, an FDA spokesperson acknowledged that reports of rebound "are important to evaluate further," but reiterated that the drug appeared 88% effective at reducing the risk of hospitalization or death in its clinical trial.\n\n"The FDA is evaluating the reports of viral load rebound after completing Paxlovid treatment and will share recommendations if appropriate," said the FDA\'s Chanapa Tantibanchachai.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/04/26/75834f94-0c35-4873-8166-5e4b24cfa0d3/thumbnail/1200x630/5625e6265f72e4689718b2845b0511c4/gettyimages-1238865166.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:22'}

Supply of the regimen was initially very limited, but as Covid-19 cases across the country have fallen and manufacturing has increased, it is now far more abundant. The White House is now moving to raise awareness of the pill and its availability, as well as making it easier to access.\n\nThe White House said Tuesday it is increasingly reaching out to doctors and announced that the drug will now be shipped directly to pharmacies, in addition to existing distribution channels run by states. That is expected to increase the number of sites from 20,000 to more than 30,000 next week and eventually to 40,000 locations.\n\nHowever, according to a senior Biden administration official speaking anonymously to Axios, many states are ordering just two-thirds of what is available to them and are using half their orders.\n\nProviders are probably limiting access to the pill because “we’ve had the experience in this pandemic before of operating in a scarcity mindset,” another administration official said in a press conference.\n\nMany states have opted for a lottery system to allocate Paxlovid and other Covid-19 drugs, often choosing to distribute the drugs to retail pharmacies instead of hospitals and clinics.\n\nAccording to Dr Douglas White, a University of Pittsburgh critical care doctor who helped design Pennsylvania’s lottery system for Covid-19 drug allocation, the system ends up favoring people who are not only aware of the drugs but have access to doctors to prescribe it and the ability to locate pharmacies that have them in stock.\n\n“The wealthy and well-connected will win the race,” White told the Los Angeles Times. It’s “the poster child for an unfair system.”\n\nDespite the administration’s attempt to reassure providers that there are enough pills for patients, in an interview with NPR on Monday, the White House’s Covid-19 response coordinator, Dr Ashish Jha, said that there are only enough pills “for the short run.” As of Tuesday, the US had ordered enough supply of the pills for 20 million people, which is estimated to last for several more months.\n\n“Right now, we’ve done a really good job of acquiring pills,” Jha said, adding that the Biden administration will need additional funding from Congress to acquire more pills. “We have to make sure that this is more than a short-term solution.”\n\nJha warned that the US will be running out of money for Paxlovid “reasonably soon,” and that “we actually aren’t even going to be able to pay our bills for what we’ve already entered into a contract with Pfizer for, so that’s going to be a problem.”\n\nThe Biden administration is expected to renew its request to Congress for $22bn in Covid-19 funding.\n\nPaxlovid, when administered within five days of symptoms appearing, has been proven to bring about a 90% reduction in hospitalizations and deaths among patients most likely to get severe disease. About 350 Americans are now dying each day from Covid-19, down from more than 2,600 during the height of the Omicron wave earlier this year.\n\nThe FDA authorized Pfizer’s drug for emergency use in adults and children age 12 or older with a positive Covid-19 test and early symptoms who face the highest risk of severe outcomes. That includes older people and those with conditions like obesity and heart disease, though the drug is not recommended for patients with severe kidney or liver problems.\n\nThe administration is also working to expand the number of “test-to-treat” sites that provide a one-stop shop for those with Covid-19 to get tested for the virus, consult with a medical professional if they’re positive and fill a prescription for Paxlovid on site.\n\nThere are now 2,200 such locations nationwide, though the administration hopes more sites come online in the next several weeks with support from the Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and pharmacy companies.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ec9f8e72eff2d14c7cbb28bd8af41604fea72e5/0_301_5075_3047/master/5075.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=269eeb032fb24072e4c2185b17d3cc66', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:54'}

TWTR -3.91% will need to follow the bloc’s new rules for tackling illegal and harmful content online if it wants to keep operating there, marking a possible challenge to Elon Musk’s plans to take a more hands-off approach to content moderation.\n\nThierry Breton, EU internal market commissioner, said Tuesday in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that it’s his job to make sure companies, including Twitter, understand their obligations in Europe. That will soon include a series of new obligations for social media and other online platforms, called the Digital Services Act, after lawmakers agreed to the main points of the legislation last week.\n\n“Now we have very clear rules,” Mr. Breton said. “They can do whatever they want outside of Europe…but in Europe they will just have to fulfill [our] rules and obligations.”\n\nThe Digital Services Act aims to force platforms to take more responsibility for the content their users post online. It will introduce a series of obligations for large social-media networks like Twitter, ranging from new standards for taking down illegal content to a requirement to conduct annual risk assessments detailing how they are responding to harmful content that is posted online.\n\nTwitter will become a private company if Elon Musk’s $44 billion takeover bid is approved. The move would allow Musk to make changes to the site. WSJ’s Dan Gallagher explains Musk’s proposed changes and the challenges he might face enacting them.

He is familiar with European rules on automotive, and will quickly adapt to the Digital Services Act.”\n\nMr. Musk’s purchase of Twitter could mark an eventual test case for the EU’s new legislation once it comes into effect, said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond. While there are questions about whether the European Commission will have the resources to fully enforce the new law, Prof. Tobias said, “I do think [Mr. Musk] is on notice, and Twitter shareholders, too.”\n\nMr. Musk wrote on Twitter Tuesday afternoon that his view of free speech is speech that “matches the law.”\n\n“I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law,” he said. “If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect.”\n\nMr. Breton said the EU was careful in setting its regulations to maintain freedom of speech. He said he had interactions with many platforms during the lawmaking process and was open to meeting with others, in a comment that appeared to be aimed at Mr. Musk. “If any new shareholder of these platforms is willing to engage with me, my door will be totally open, like always,” he said.\n\nThe EU’s new legislation won’t prevent Mr. Musk from taking a more free-speech-oriented approach, said Zach Meyers, a senior research fellow with the Centre for European Reform think tank.

In the wake of this "great deplatforming," Republicans\' longstanding gripes with these platforms became a legislative priority.\n\nOne of the most aggressive of these Republican-led efforts to regulate social media is Texas\' H.B. 20. Ostensibly passed to combat the "dangerous movement by social media companies to silence conservative viewpoints and ideas," this bill prohibits social media platforms from removing users or content "based on the viewpoint" of the user or content. In its effort to protect conservative speech, Texas Republicans have adopted a historically discredited left-wing legal theory, dispensing with core conservative values in the process.\n\nIn the 1960s, a group of progressive scholars argued that the First Amendment does not merely prohibit the government from censoring private speech and press. In fact, they argued, it granted the government the affirmative power to control the mass media. In a capitalist system, they reasoned, the government must ensure that private media owners do not exclude unwelcome viewpoints, in order to protect the "democratic interest" in free speech. To this end, the scholars championed the Fairness Doctrine, right-of-reply mandates, and expansive applications of "common carriage" doctrine, which enable the government to force the inclusion of certain content.\n\nBorrowing from the same playbook, Texas now argues that First Amendment values require, rather than prohibit, government interference with private speech. H.B. 20 declares that social media platforms are common carriers like telephone companies and thus are subject to onerous restrictions over who and what they may host. According to Texas, H.B. 20 serves the democratic interest in protecting the free exchange of ideas and information. But like the collectivist efforts that preceded it, Texas\' misguided attempt to advance "First Amendment rights in the Lone Star State" violates private platforms\' First Amendment rights to choose what speech they publish.\n\nAs we explained in a recently filed amicus curiae brief on behalf of the Cato Institute, courts have repeatedly rejected such regulations, and for good reasons.\n\nFirst, as a federal district court correctly noted last year, the First Amendment protects social media platforms\' discretion to publish or remove content. The Supreme Court established this right in the 1974 case Miami Herald Publishing Company v. Tornillo, when it struck down a Florida law that forced newspapers to print responses to their criticism of political candidates. The Court explained that this "right-of-reply" law infringed on newspapers\' right to choose what content they publish.\n\nThe Supreme Court affirmed that First Amendment rights apply with full force to internet media in 1997\'s Reno v. ACLU. Other federal courts have since upheld the editorial rights of search engines and social media sites. These precedents doom the Texas law. The state can\'t eviscerate platforms\' well-established First Amendment rights by arbitrarily calling them common carriers.\n\nSecond, efforts like H.B. 20 chill, rather than encourage, the exercise of free speech. Both the Florida right-of-reply law and the Fairness Doctrine actually discouraged the media from covering controversial topics that would trigger the forced-hosting requirements. Likewise, H.B. 20 will encourage platforms to ban entire subjects (say, discussions of terrorism) to avoid facing the unappetizing choice to either host objectionable viewpoints (such as pro-terrorism material) or face liability for removing each piece of content.\n\nThird, H.B. 20 violates fundamental property rights by forcing private platforms to host users and content they would otherwise exclude. The First Amendment does not authorize the government to co-opt private property to amplify certain viewpoints.\n\nThe supporters of the Texas law, like other conservative opponents of Big Tech, cite anecdotal accounts of inconsistent content moderation to support their claim of unfair bias. But it\'s more likely that these incidents are just casualties of the margin of error inherent in content moderation at scale. "Incorrect" removals of content happen millions of times per day to users representing every conceivable ideology. Conservatives are removed from platforms when they violate platforms\' terms of service, but Texas\' premise that conservatives are being unfairly targeted is unsubstantiated.\n\nBut even if it was substantiated, forced-hosting laws like H.B. 20 would contravene limited government, constitutional fidelity, and strong property rights, all of which are supposed to be core conservative values. If Texas Republicans really want to protect "conservative viewpoints," they should reacquaint themselves with those principles and reject giving the government more control over social media.', 'image': 'https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2022/04/timothy-hales-bennett-OwvRB-M3GwE-unsplash-scaled.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:31'}

It is a reminder why we need a wealth tax and why we need some serious regulation for Big Tech. One billionaire should not be able to turn the world upside down just because he plays by a different set of rules,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who believes the government should break up Big Tech companies to promote more competition.\n\nAsked whether Musk’s acquisition of Twitter was cause for concern, Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said: “Absolutely it does.”\n\n“He said he wants to make it this global message board. My first question to him, ‘Is your message board going to include Donald Trump?’ ” he said. “That’s a key question. If he lets that man rant and rave on Twitter, not in the best interests of America’s’ future.”\n\nDurbin, who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee, noted that his and other panels are exploring whether it would be appropriate to impose new regulations on Big Tech companies to incentivize them to do more to moderate content.\n\nSpeaking at Stanford last week, Obama said tech firms “need to be more transparent about how they operate” and crack down on “lies and conspiracy theories” that threaten the nation’s democratic system.\n\n“Without some standards, implications of this technology — for our elections, for our legal system, for our democracy, for rules of evidence, for our entire social order — are frightening and profound,” he warned.\n\nMusk hasn’t said whether he’ll let Trump, who was permanently barred from Twitter in January 2021, back on the platform, but his recent comments have fueled speculation that he might do so. Trump has indicated he’s not interested in getting back on Twitter, though he is known for changing his mind.\n\nSen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he also had concerns about what Musk’s purchase of Twitter might mean for the platform’s content standards.\n\nHe said he was looking into the matter but declined to provide any detail.\n\n“I’ve got some concerns. I think it will have to go through … some level of appropriate regulatory [review], and I’m doing some of my own checking,” he said.\n\nSen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) said Musk’s control over a major forum for political debate is alarming.\n\n“It’s always a concern when an oligarch may be owning the town square. I think we do need to pay a lot of attention to how it’s managed,” he said.\n\nMusk’s takeover of Twitter raises questions about what it means for his settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over fraud charges stemming from his August 2018 tweet that he had secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 per share, which pushed the car company’s stock higher.\n\nUnder the settlement, Musk must allow a Tesla lawyer to review any tweets containing material business information before hitting the send button.\n\nSen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), the chairwoman of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, said allowing Trump back on Twitter would be a major problem.\n\n“I think that’s very problematic,” she said of Trump’s possible return. “I don’t think that somebody who encouraged and organized a violent insurrection to take over our government should be allowed on Twitter.”\n\nAsked about the loosening of content standards, she said she “would certainly have concerns” but added she hadn’t looked at the deal closely enough to “get into a big analysis.”\n\nTrump, who has launched a social media venture that includes a platform intended to vie with Twitter, told Fox News on Monday that he doesn’t plan to return to Twitter.\n\n“I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,” he said, referring to his Truth Social messaging platform, before the deal was announced. “I hope Elon buys Twitter because he’ll make improvements to it and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth. The bottom line is, no, I am not going back to Twitter.”\n\nTwitter permanently suspended Trump because of what it called “the risk of further incitement of violence” after a mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to halt the certification of President Biden’s victory.\n\nTwitter later unveiled a civic integrity policy that prohibited the use of its services for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes. It also reserved the right to flag or reduce the visibility of tweets containing false or misleading information about civic processes.\n\nAt a TED conference this month, Musk stressed the importance of allowing free speech on Twitter.\n\n“Twitter has become kind of the de facto town square, so it’s just really important that people have both the reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely within the bounds of the law,” he said.\n\nConservatives on Monday applauded Musk’s move.\n\n“Elon Musk did his part for free speech today. Let’s hope the Supreme Court does as well,” former Rep. Mark Walker (N.C.), a conservative Republican running for Senate, tweeted Monday afternoon.\n\nDemocrats are worried what that means for policing claims that Biden stole the 2020 presidential election or misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n“I’m a big free speech guy, but this stuff isn’t working. It’s terrorizing democracy, and from that perspective I think it’s bad for Democrats in this sense: These Republican alt groups tend to dominate.

He controls literally hundreds of millions of hits, if you will, or clicks on a platform that he can determine whether it’s used in a good way or a bad way, and that’s too much concentration with one individual,” Jarding added.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/stabenowdebbie_020922arl.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:10'}

As YouTube celebrates its 17th birthday, the game-changing user-generated video platform once known for funny pet videos and other benign content continues to attract criticism for its alleged role in fostering extremism. Ample evidence casts doubt on the idea that social media platforms are radicalizing American youth, but high-profile anecdotes about bad turns allegedly inspired by YouTube, Facebook, and other sites make it hard to combat such claims. Now one such story may come before the Supreme Court—and threaten a foundational internet speech law.\n\nThe case (Gonzalez v. Google LLC) involves a man whose daughter was killed in a 2015 ISIS attack in Paris. The grieving father, Reynaldo Gonzalez, sued YouTube\'s parent company, Google, under the U.S. Anti-Terrorism Act. Gonzalez claims that ISIS posted recruitment videos on YouTube, that YouTube recommended these videos to users, and that this led to his daughter\'s death.\n\nGonzalez\'s circumstances are tragic, but his claim is convoluted and patently illogical. To buy it, you have to buy the idea that without YouTube, the terrorist group not only would be unable to recruit members but would cease to use existing networks to carry out attacks.\n\nThe Supreme Court has not yet decided whether it will hear Gonzalez\'s case. But if it does, it could give the Court a chance to consider the parameters of Section 230, the federal law preventing internet companies and users from being liable for all third-party speech (and pretty much the backbone of the internet as we know it).\n\nSCOTUSblog notes that in 2020, Justice Clarence Thomas suggested that "in an appropriate case, we should consider whether the text of this increasingly important statute aligns with the current state of immunity enjoyed by Internet platforms." (Thomas made a similar suggestion earlier this year.)\n\n"The petition in Gonzalez v. Google LLC tries to present itself as the case Thomas has been looking for," writes Andrew Hamm:\n\nThe district court dismissed Gonzalez\'s claim on the ground that Section 230 nonetheless protected Google for its recommendations because ISIS produced the videos, not Google. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit affirmed, concluding that Section 230 protects such recommendations, at least if the provider\'s algorithm treated content on its website similarly. However, the panel in Gonzalez considered itself bound to reach this result because of a recent case on the same issue that another 9th Circuit panel decided while Gonzalez was pending. The Gonzalez panel further concluded that, if it could resolve the question itself, Section 230 would not protect a provider\'s content recommendations. Gonzalez admits that the circuits to face this question are not split. Instead, Gonzalez suggests that, had his case simply come out before the other 9th Circuit decision, then Google would be the one seeking review. Regardless, he maintains, the providers\' financial dependence on advertisements and hence on algorithms that can target users makes this question of recommendations important to resolve.\n\nGonzalez is far from the first person to sue social media companies over terrorist acts. But these people "have yet to talk a court into agreeing with their arguments," as Tim Cushing noted at Techdirt last fall.\n\n"The facts in these cases are invariably awful: often people have been brutally killed and their loved ones are seeking redress for their loss. There is a natural, and perfectly reasonable, temptation to give them some sort of remedy from someone, but as we argued in our brief, that someone cannot be an internet platform," wrote constitutional lawyer Cathy Gellis in 2017:\n\nThere are several reasons for this, including some that have nothing to do with Section 230. For instance, even if Section 230 did not exist and platforms could be liable for the harms resulting from their users\' use of their services, for them to be liable there would have to be a clear connection between the use of the platform and the harm.\n\nSection 230 "should prevent a court from ever even reaching the tort law analysis," added Gellis. "With Section 230, a platform should never find itself having to defend against liability for harm that may have resulted from how people used it."\n\nA new study backs up what advocates for Section 230 have been saying for a long time: The law protects small companies and creators more than big tech giants.\n\n"If you understand the mechanisms by which Section 230 actually works, the key is that it gets frivolous and wasteful lawsuits kicked out of court much earlier—when the costs are still intense, but more bearable," points out Mike Masnick in a Techdirt post about the study. "Without Section 230, the end result of the court case may be the same—where the company wins—but the costs would be much, much higher. For Facebook and Google that\'s not going to make a huge difference. But for smaller companies, it can be the difference between life and death."\n\n"Larger enterprises are less impacted by lawsuits," point out the authors of the study, in a report titled "Understanding Section 230 & the Impact of Litigation on Small Providers." A large company "may already have: 1) lawyers ready to deal with lawsuits (allowing the business to continue with minimal disruption); 2) insurance coverage that can offset the cost of a defense, a settlement, or a damage award; and 3) sufficient revenue and cash reserves such that most cases are viewed as a cost of doing business rather than a cataclysmic event."\n\nSmall companies are less likely to have or be able to afford any of these things, making it less likely that they will fight even lawsuits that they would win.\n\nPoliticians, alas, have taken to scapegoating Section 230 for basically anything they or their constituents don\'t like about the internet. And lawyers keep getting creative in their anti–Section 230 arguments, suggesting that while Section 230 may broadly protect internet platforms from liability for many things that users post, the law does not covers various facets of these platforms—their design, their algorithms, etc..\n\nOccasionally, judges appear sympathetic to this. In Taamneh v. Twitter, which the 9th Circuit ruled on last year, Judge Marsha Berzon wrote that Section 230 protects "only traditional activities of publication and distribution—such as deciding whether to publish, withdraw, or alter content—and does not include activities that promote or recommend content or connect content users to each other. I urge this Court to reconsider our precedent en banc to the extent that it holds that section 230 extends to the use of machine-learning algorithms to recommend content and connections to users."\n\n"This is a really weird, really dangerous place to start drawing the line in Section 230 lawsuits," wrote Tim Cushing last summer. "Algorithms react to input from users. If YouTube can\'t be held directly responsible for videos uploaded by users, it makes sense it would be immunized against algorithmically suggesting content based on users\' actions and preferences. The algorithm does next to nothing on its own without input from content viewers. It takes a user to really get it moving."\n\nFREE MINDS\n\nA federal appeals court has rejected a university\'s ban on "discriminatory harassment." The University of Central Florida\'s "discriminatory harassment" ban likely violates the First Amendment, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals said. The case is Speech First, Inc. v. Cartwright, and you can read the whole ruling here. In essence, the court found the school\'s policy against allegedly discriminatory speech to be too broad:\n\n[T]he policy (1) prohibits a wide range of "verbal, physical, electronic, and other" expression concerning any of (depending on how you count) some 25 or so characteristics; (2) states that prohibited speech "may take many forms, including verbal acts, name-calling, graphic or written statements" and even "other conduct that may be humiliating"; (3) employs a gestaltish "totality of known circumstances" approach to determine whether particular speech, for instance, "unreasonably alters" another student\'s educational experience; and (4) reaches not only a student\'s own speech, but also her conduct "encouraging," "condoning," or "failing to intervene" to stop another student\'s speech. The policy, in short, is staggeringly broad, and any number of statements—some of which are undoubtedly protected by the First Amendment—could qualify for prohibition under its sweeping standards. To take a few obvious examples, the policy targets "verbal, physical, electronic or other conduct" based on "race," "ethnicity," "religion [or] non-religion," "sex," and "political affiliation." Among the views that Speech First\'s members have said they want to advocate are that "abortion is immoral," that the government "should not be able to force religious organizations to recognize marriages with which they disagree," that "affirmative action is deeply unfair," that "a man cannot become a woman because he \'feels\' like one," that "illegal immigration is dangerous," and that "the Palestinian movement is anti-Semitic."\n\nIn a concurring opinion, Judge Stanley Marcus warned against "the grave peril posed by a policy that effectively polices adherence to intellectual dogma."\n\n"History provides us with ample warning of those times and places when colleges and universities have stopped pursuing truth and have instead turned themselves into cathedrals for the worship of certain dogma," wrote Marcus. "By depriving itself of academic institutions that pursue truth over any other concern, a society risks falling into the abyss of ignorance. Humans are not smart enough to have ideas that lie beyond challenge and debate."\n\nThe Volokh Conspiracy has more on the ruling (which includes the lovely line "the state is a really big boy") here.\n\nFREE MARKETS\n\nPrivate space mission on its way back to earth. The first privately-funded trip to the International Space Station started its return trip yesterday. More from CNN:\n\nThe mission, called AX-1, was brokered by the Houston, Texas-based startup Axiom Space, which books rocket rides, provides all the necessary training, and coordinates flights to the ISS for anyone who can afford it. The four crew members—Michael López-Alegría, a former NASA astronaut-turned-Axiom employee who is commanding the mission; Israeli businessman Eytan Stibbe; Canadian investor Mark Pathy; and Ohio-based real estate magnate Larry Connor—left the space station aboard their SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule on Sunday at 9:10 pm EST….They will spend about one day free flying through orbit before plummeting back into the atmosphere and parachuting to a splashdown landing off the coast of Florida around 1 pm ET Monday. AX-1, which launched on April 8, was originally billed as a 10-day mission, but delays extended the mission by about a week.\n\nThis isn\'t the first time private citizens have been able to pay for seats on spacecraft. "But AX-1 is the first mission with a crew entirely comprised of private citizens with no active members of a government astronaut corps accompanying them in the capsule during the trip to and from the ISS," reports CNN. "It\'s also the first time private citizens have traveled to the ISS on a US-made spacecraft."\n\nAnd it\'s also a powerful reminder that perhaps the next era of space exploration needn\'t be government funded and managed.\n\nQUICK HITS\n\n• Air Force Major General William T.

I do not want to get into any conversation about [former Vice President Mike] Pence pardoning,” McCarthy says in the Jan. 10 recording as part of a broader conversation about Trump potentially resigning after the riot.\n\nExperts say the committee may want to zero in on that exchange, as the audio shows Republicans at the highest level may have been worried about the legality of Trump’s actions leading up to Jan. 6.\n\n“You would not want to be the middleman in a conversation about Trump being pardoned by Pence because [McCarthy] would be concerned about somebody saying he obstructed justice in some way,” said Jeff Robbins, a former U.S. attorney who also served as chief counsel for the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.\n\n“There’s no need to have a personal fear about being involved in a pardon conversation unless there’s been some suggestion of a conversation about a pardon. And there’s no need to have a discussion about a pardon unless people within McCarthy’s sphere are having serious discussions about Trump’s culpability in a crime,” he added.\n\n“And there’s no need for a pardon if all you’ve done is something that is immoral or unethical or optically bad. The need for a pardon exists when there is criminal culpability.”\n\nThe conversation itself, Robbins said, suggests such questions were likely a topic of conversation among McCarthy and other high-ranking Republicans between Jan. 6 and Jan. 10.\n\nThe select committee has asked McCarthy to voluntarily speak with the committee’s investigators — an invitation he rebuffed.\n\nAmong the things the panel outlined to the minority leader were a desire to speak about his conversations with Trump during and after the attack, as well as prior reports that McCarthy said the former president admitted to being somewhat responsible for the attack — a line receiving renewed attention after being relayed in audio recordings of McCarthy.\n\n“I think it is very important that Kevin McCarthy has evidence the former president acknowledged bearing some responsibility for that attack on the Capitol. This is an admission of guilt by the former president,” Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) told CBS News.\n\n“The reports of what the president said, that he understood that he bore responsibility, that’s consciousness of his guilt. And it is an important element of piecing together all of the facts relative to Jan. 6,” Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), another committee member, told the outlet.\n\nThe criminality of Trump’s actions has been of keen interest to the committee, which recently argued in a civil case that one of his attorneys could not claim attorney-client privilege to shield documents, as such an exception is not valid when legal advice was given in furtherance of a crime. A judge largely agreed with the committee and ordered John Eastman to turn over new documents.\n\nBut Robbins said the discussion around a pardon could be more illuminating when it comes to guilt.\n\n“Saying that he accepted some responsibility is too vague, it could mean a lot of different things,” he said.\n\n“The conclusion that the former president may have actually committed a federal crime comes into play in reference to his personal fear in getting involved in a conversation about a pardon,” he added. “Letting down the American people, none of that implicates any requirement for a pardon. Crimes require pardons.”\n\nBut Michael Stern, who previously served as \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bspecial counsel to the House Intelligence Committee, said the pardon conversation may not carry as much water with Trump, who frequently asserted well before Jan. 6 that he may even be able to pardon himself and used the legal tool heavily while in office.\n\nAnd while McCarthy may have wanted to steer clear of any conversation that involved a quid pro quo, the discussion itself doesn’t indicate guilt related to Jan. 6, Stern said.\n\n“There are many things that [Trump’s] being investigated for which don’t have anything to do with Jan. 6 and which probably are more legally dangerous for him. So [I wouldn’t] draw the conclusion that this was specifically about potential legal jeopardy related to Jan. 6, as opposed to just Trump would recognize the fact that if he left the presidency, with respect to Jan. 6 or lots of other things, he’s going to face a lot of investigations,” and may seek a pardon as a “sweetener” for leaving office, Stern said.\n\nBut getting those details would be difficult, he added.\n\n“As far as if this is something that the committee is interested in, the problem that they have is the problem they have with all of these members, which is they really don’t have a practical way of forcing them to testify,” Stern said.\n\nHe added that while a subpoena is “theoretically available … I just don’t think politically or institutionally it’s going to be something they’re willing to use.”\n\nThere is one member of the committee who may have some insight: Vice Chairwoman Liz Cheney (Wyo.), one of the panel’s two Republicans, who can be heard on the call with McCarthy.\n\n“What’s most notable about it is that it sounds as though he believes that nobody else on the call needs to have a further explanation of it. That is to say, it sounds as if he knows that the question of a potential pardon by Pence has come up in some form. He doesn’t explain what he means, he doesn’t tell people the reason I’m raising this is X, Y, or Z,” Robbins said. “It sounds as though people or their staffs have already been discussing the question of whether or not, for instance, his resignation should be linked in any way to a potential pardon.”\n\nWhile the call could hold value for the committee, it’s less clear it will be of any use to the Department of Justice.\n\n“I don’t think the McCarthy tapes shed any light on a criminal investigation. I think it is harmful to him politically, in that it shows that he appreciated the gravity of Trump’s conduct at one time,” said Barbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney.\n\nIt also might be of more political than investigative value to the committee, which is gearing up for hearings as early as May.\n\n“They need to make a decision about when to just sort of move forward with the information that they have, because they can’t just keep getting more information forever,” said Molly Reynolds, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution who has focused on the committee’s work.\n\nThe committee has been debating whether its final report on the matter should include a recommendation to the Department of Justice to pursue charges against Trump — a referral the department may not chose to take.\n\nBut Reynolds said the bigger picture for the committee is making a compelling case for the public.\n\n“The select committee has a different job than the Department of Justice. The select committee’s job is to hold people accountable in a public way for behavior — some of which may be criminal and some of which may not be —and to tell the story in a way that gets its arms around as much of what happened as possible,” she said.\n\n“That’s hard, but that’s their job.”', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/mccarthykevin_030122gn4_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:50'}

This afternoon, the board accepted Musk\'s offer to buy the company for $54.20 a share.\n\nLong a Twitter power user/troll/loudmouth, Musk bought a 9.2 percent stake in the company last month, becoming the largest shareholder, before deciding he\'d rather have the whole thing.\n\nCue hysteria! Musk haters have taken to the site to declare that Donald Trump will now probably win the 2024 election, that Musk\'s bid is really about white power, that Section 230 must be reformed, and that, yes, Musk\'s new policies will be lethal. (Perhaps the death toll will be even larger than net neutrality\'s!)\n\nSo, for users of the platform, what\'s likely to change?\n\nMusk has panned the site\'s existing content moderation policies, saying they are too restrictive and encroach on people\'s ability to speak freely without being censored. Some liberalization of these policies and the re-platforming of controversial figures like former President Donald Trump—who was banned in the wake of the January 6 riot for inciting violence among his fans—seems likely, though unpopular with droves of users.\n\nAt the mid-April TED conference in Vancouver, Musk talked about his interest in making Twitter\'s algorithm open-source. The Diff\'s Byrne Hobart took this a step further, outlining how "Twitter should monetize a protocol rather than run an app," and explaining the tension between Twitter as a consumer product and as "a way for individual users to update a universal shared database, which can then be filtered based on who\'s interested in what." Hobart claims that it\'s possible that Twitter has been "radically miss-monetized," and that Musk could potentially realign its priorities. However, little of the online discourse has focused on the technical possibilities.\n\nThe new Twitter owner has, through coy tweets, hinted that his new policies will not be applied arbitrarily and that consistent application will mean some number of right-wing users currently cheering his new ownership will surely be disappointed:\n\nI hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 25, 2022\n\nA social media platform\'s policies are good if the most extreme 10% on left and right are equally unhappy — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 19, 2022\n\nElsewhere, Musk has said that Twitter is a "town square" or "public square," and that banning people from using the platform effectively prevents them from participating in the important discussions of the day.\n\nThough people who care about fostering a culture of free speech may agree with the tenor of Musk\'s comments, the analogy is a terrible one. For most of America, the public square is the school board meeting and the town council meeting. There are also numerous other privates spaces for civic engagement: the church pulpit and the post-sermon fray it inspires; neighborhood listservs and the cesspool that is NextDoor; or maybe it\'s Facebook, in-person conversations, and email lists. For many millions of Americans, Twitter is not integral to hashing out values, concerns, and disagreements. Think of the implications if we expected the government to treat such companies—which have their own terms of service and standards that they are free to decide and we are free to consent to—as something akin to public utilities.\n\nIf anything, the new owner of a social media company should convey an inflated sense of the platform\'s worth! But Musk has at times, despite his forceful defense of free speech culture on the internet, repeated confused talking points that indicate scattered thinking while simultaneously failing to fully flesh out what day-to-day operations will look like. For example, a lot of content moderation involves the unsexy—and not very ideological—challenge of keeping spam under control. And, as Mike Masnick points out at Techdirt, Musk doesn\'t seem to have a particularly robust understanding of "hate speech" and how much of what we call hate speech is, in fact, protected by the First Amendment.\n\nA lot remains to be seen about how Twitter will change and what Musk will bring to the table. Optimism, with some reservations about Musk\'s ability to execute, seems warranted.

Musk paid $44 billion to acquire the social media platform with the stated aim of turning it into a haven for "free speech."\n\nThe web is awash in speculation over what that means. Conservatives and people booted off the platform have pushed for Musk to reinstate banned accounts, including that of former President Donald Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, prominent Twitter figures are now saying they\'ll leave the platform in protest of its new owner. Among them is English actress Jameela Jamil, who tweeted her fears Monday that Musk "is going to help this hell platform reach its final form of totally lawless hate, bigotry, and misogyny."\n\nIt\'s unclear whether Musk will be able to realize all his plans for Twitter. The tech leader has floated less moderation, less advertising and an open-source algorithm. But Musk\'s stated ideals contradict his own actions.\n\nWhat Musk says he wants\n\nMusk has made clear he wants less moderation — which he considers censorship — on the platform.\n\n"Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated," he said in Monday\'s announcement about the acquisition.\n\nHe also said he wants to defeat the "spambots," or automated accounts that mimic real users; open the algorithm to public inspection and "authenticate all humans" using the platform.\n\nMusk laid out a definition of speech in a TED interview last week.\n\n"A good sign as to whether there is free speech is, is someone you don\'t like allowed to say something you don\'t like? If that is the case, we have free speech," he said.\n\nMusk said Twitter would abide by national laws that restrict speech around the world. Beyond that, he said, he\'d be "very reluctant" to delete posts or permanently ban users who violate the company\'s rules.\n\nHe had previously criticized Trump\'s ban from social media in the wake of the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Twitter and Facebook permanently banned Trump\'s account on the grounds that he incited violence.\n\n"A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech," Musk tweeted days after Trump was banned from both Facebook and Twitter.\n\nHow Musk responds to disagreement\n\nMusk\'s own history, however, puts in doubt his commitment to let people he doesn\'t like speak. As the newsletter Popular Information has documented, Musk has regularly blocked users who criticize him or Tesla; threatened pro-union Tesla employees and company whistleblowers; and has aggressively gone after short-sellers and journalists who are critical of Tesla, sometimes calling their work "false" or "misleading."\n\nIn 2018, he launched a vendetta against Linette Lopez, an Insider journalist critical of Tesla, a move which writer Felix Salmon called "obsessive and deranged."\n\nMusk\'s popular tweets typically send a swarm of his social media fans directly to the accounts of reporters to harass them for hours or days.\n\nSome academics say that Musk\'s hands-off approach threatens to bring Twitter to its bad old days, when harassment and abuse were rampant.\n\n"With Musk, his posturing of free speech — just leave everything up — that would be bad in and of itself," said Paul Barrett, the deputy director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University. "If you stop moderating — with automated systems and human reviews — a site like Twitter, in the space of a short period of time, you would have a cesspool."\n\nSome former Twitter employees are also dismayed by Musk\'s successful bid for the company.\n\n"Twitter is going to let a man-child essentially take over their platform," said Leslie Miley, a former Twitter employee who has also worked for Google and Apple. Miley, who was the only Black engineer at Twitter in a leadership position when he left the company in 2015, echoed doubts shared by others about Musk\'s grasp of the platform\'s complexities.\n\n"I am not sure if Elon knows what he is getting," Miley said. "He may just find that having Twitter is a lot different than wanting Twitter."\n\nUnfettered expression does not attract advertisers\n\nA decade ago, a Twitter executive called the company "the free speech wing of the free speech party," underscoring its commitment to untrammeled freedom of expression. But the company reversed itself after reports of online abuse and harassment became frequent.\n\nIn the U.S., a visceral 2014 article by journalist Amanda Hess exposed the incessant, vile harassment many women faced just for posting on Twitter or other online forums. Twitter also learned about the consequences of an unmoderated social platform: mainly, that it undercut their funding from advertisers.\n\nAds are how Twitter makes money, and companies generally don\'t want their ads running against violent threats, hate speech that bleeds into incitement or incendiary information aimed at tipping elections or undermining public health.\n\nGoogle, Barrett pointed out, quickly learned this lesson the hard way when major companies like Toyota and Anheuser-Busch yanked their ads after they ran ahead of YouTube videos produced by extremists in 2015.\n\nOnce it was clear just how unhealthy the conversation had gotten, Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey spent years trying to improve what he called the "health" of the conversation on the platform.\n\nThe company was an early adopter of the "report abuse" button after U.K. member of parliament Stella Creasy received a barrage of rape and death threats on the platform. The online abuse was the result of a seemingly positive tweet in support of feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez, who successfully advocated for novelist Jane Austen to appear on a British banknote. Creasy\'s online harasser was sent to prison for 18 weeks.\n\nTwitter has continued to craft rules and invest in staff and technology that detected violent threats, harassment and misinformation that violated its policies. After evidence emerged that Russia used Twitter\'s platforms to try to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election, social media companies stepped up their efforts against political misinformation. All have struggled with defining "misinformation," however, and been accused of both leaving up false content as well as over-censoring legitimate posts.\n\nHard to unwind moderation\n\nThe big question now is how far Musk wants to ratchet back these systems — and whether users and advertisers will stick around if he does.\n\nLike Miley, the former Twitter engineer, experts who have studied content moderation and researched Twitter express doubt that Musk knows what he is getting into. After all, there are plenty of fledgling examples of so-called free speech-focused platforms that have been launched in the past few years as Twitter alternatives, largely by conservatives unhappy with the Twitter\'s crackdown on hate, harassment and misinformation. Many such sites have struggled to deal with toxic content, and at least one has been cut off by its own technology providers in protest.\n\n"This move just shows how effective (moderation features) have been to annoy those in power," said Kirsten Martin, a professor of technology ethics at the University of Notre Dame. "I would be worried as to how this would change Twitter\'s values."\n\nThe fact that no other bidders emerged in public before Musk\'s deal was a sign that other would-be acquirers might find Twitter too difficult to improve, said Third Bridge analyst Scott Kessler.\n\n"This platform is pretty much the same one we\'ve had over the last decade or so," Kessler said. "You\'ve had a lot of smart people trying to figure out what they should do, and they\'ve had trouble. It\'s probably going to be tough to make a lot of headway."\n\nEven now, Americans say they\'re more likely to be harassed on social media than any other online forum, with women, people of color and LGBTQ users reporting a disproportionate amount of that abuse. Roughly 80% of users believe the companies are still doing only a "fair or poor" job of handling that harassment, according to a Pew Research Center survey of U.S. adults last year.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/04/30/39aaad79-fd57-40fa-b203-bc4143cf40f2/thumbnail/1200x630g8/aef00fb0dcf931880dd52af0a50dc345/gettyimages-1206290121.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:24'}

Because those who are investigating the Biden family and their enterprise can be fired by the head of the family who is being investigated,” Hagerty said.\n\nGarland declined to say whether the department has or is considering appointing a special counsel, though he noted that special counsels are also employees of the Department of Justice.\n\nHe also would not answer when asked if he agreed with the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller, who was tasked with investigating allegations of collusion between Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia.\n\n“The question of whether to have a special counsel is one that is internal decision-making in the department, so I don’t want to make any judgments one way or the other,” Garland told Sen.

In Canada, vaccine-free Canadians still cannot board a train or a plane and travel from one region of the country to another.\n\nIn Canada, air and train travel are regulated by the federal government, even when you travel within the same province. The feds have made it so only a vaccine passport, or very limited jab exemptions, will afford you the opportunity to visit family, friends, or travel for work.\n\nThis means that if you lived in, let’s say, Kitchener, Ontario, you could not get on a VIA Rail train and travel to Toronto… even though you could travel from Kitchener to Toronto on a commuter train that is not under federal jurisdiction.\n\nIsn’t “science” wonderful!\n\nOh, and vaccine-free Canadians also can’t LEAVE the country. Unjabbed Canadians are told they can’t “put others at risk” by boarding a plane with vaccinated people (because vaccines suddenly…work?). Apparently, it is good for the unvaccinated to stay in Canada, even though … they are risk to everyone else who is protected by a vaccine?\n\nTrudeau’s insecurity on display\n\nNow, on the one hand it is quite easy to understand why Trudeau is acting like an evil dictator: he has proven himself to be an immoral tyrant on many occasions. However, given the fact that other leftist tyrants have eased up, it is clearly not just leftism or progressivism that causing him to trap Canadians indefinitely in their home like real-life versions of The Truman Show. (How fitting that it was Canadian Jim Carrey who starred in that film.)\n\nThere is something unique about Trudeau that is causing him to become “regressive” as the rest of the leftist dominated West is affording vaccine-free citizens their civil rights.\n\nTo the outside world, Trudeau may look like a confident – if not cringeworthy – tin-pot dictator, but in reality, he is a 50-year-old boy with little to no virtue. He is essentially a spoiled teenager who can remember lines and present himself well in a tailored suit and has a family name that tricked people into thinking he was competent.\n\nHis (Canadian) father, Pierre Trudeau, for all his faults, was shrewd and intelligent – even if evil. Justin Trudeau is evil and unintelligent and quite obtuse.\n\nI can’t help but think he believes he must prove himself as being his own verified dictator in order to fill his daddy’s shoes. Simply put, he is insecure and projecting.\n\n— Article continues below Petition — PETITION: Ask Elon Musk to REINSTATE LifeSite\'s Twitter accounts Show Petition Text 7936 have signed the petition.

Sign this Petition Please SIGN and SHARE this petition to the new owner of Twitter, Elon Musk, asking him to reinstate LifeSiteNews\' truth-telling Twitter accounts which have been suspended since early 2021. After contentious negotiations, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has purchased Twitter, thereby transforming the tech giant into a private company. A self-styled "free speech absolutist," Mr. Musk\'s entrepreneurial spirit may define his approach to governing Twitter, where, in the marketplace of ideas, the best ideas - not those aided by censorship - will naturally prevail among the competition. Of course, there are limits to free speech. But, for too long, Big Tech giants (including, Twitter, Google, YouTube and Facebook) have subjected their conservative and Christian users to all forms of censorship, desperately trying to silence our voices. So if, as it seems, Mr. Musk will level the playing field for conservatives and Christians and allow a true exchange of ideas to occur on his platform, then we look forward to our chance to re-engage on Twitter. Please SIGN and SHARE this petition to the new owner of Twitter, Elon Musk, asking him to reactivate LifeSiteNews\' truth-telling Twitter accounts which have been suspended since early 2021. They are: https://twitter.com/LifeSite\n\nhttps://twitter.com/LSNCatholic\n\nhttps://twitter.com/WCDM_LSN\n\nhttps://twitter.com/WCEA_LSN These accounts have been blocked by the outgoing Twitter regime for more than a year for calling a ‘transgender woman’ (Assistant Secretary of Health, \'Rachel\' Levine), a man, and for tweeting an article about the same person. The article we tweeted makes mention of the troubling paradox of having a person who denies the basic science of the human anatomy be in an authoritative position in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), but does not cast aspersions or any other such “hate speech” against Levine, according to Twitter’s "rules." It is our fervant hope that Mr. Musk intends to allow - rather than censor - our descriptions of reality as we know them to be true in regards to human sexuality, as well as in other areas of life. Mr. Musk evidently understands how significant freedom of speech is to the functioning of a free society as he was quoted as saying that this deal is important for "the future of civlization." LifeSiteNews believes that being able to spread the truth in charity is absolutely vital for the future of society, as the "truth shall make you free." (Jn 8:32) And so, in order for us to charitably spread the truth far and wide, we now seek to re-engage on Twitter\'s public square. Thank you for SIGNING and SHARING this petition to Elon Musk, urging him to now reinstate LifeSiteNews\' suspended Twitter accounts.

The New Democrats have cozied up to Trudeau in order to pretend they are a sane and legitimate party and have promised to prop up his regime. Promises don’t really mean anything when politicians make them, so we shouldn’t assume that the communists will be loyal to each other.\n\nHowever, it is obvious that public opinion is against Trudeau to a degree that he will not be able to withstand.\n\nThere is a reason why Trudeau had to resort to the Emergencies Act to squash the Freedom Convoy; no one wanted to stop it until they were forced to by law.\n\nThe various levels of provincial and municipal governance could have stopped the movement the way they stop any non-violent protest – but they didn’t want to.\n\nDoes this mean that the cops and all the citizens supported the convoy? Of course not, but I think that enough of them saw how absurd things have become and just wanted something to make the whole charade of 2020-2021-2022 go away.\n\nThe application of the Emergencies Act was wildly unpopular among Canadians, both on the Left and the Right. Leftists were happy to see the movement end but were unimpressed that Trudeau ended it in such an absurd way. Conservatives generally supported the movement, and therefore saw Trudeau as a complete lunatic for doing what he did.\n\nAll of this means that in the long run Trudeau is hurting his reputation, even among his base. This is not news for him as the Conservative leadership race heats up.\n\nFreedom is on the move\n\nWithout giving the impression that I think Canada is on the brink of some massive societal restoration, I would be remiss if I did not speak to the positives.\n\nCurrently, we are witnessing the first real Conservative leadership race in a long time. Pierre Pollievre is filling arenas and convention centres with freedom-loving crowds, and Leslyn Lewis is making leftist journalists look silly on national TV. It is worth remembering that we are talking about a leadership race, not an election, but the swell of right-wing uprising is palpable.\n\nIn fact, the last time something like this happened was after a groundswell of Christian/right-wing sentiment following years of leftist oppression under the former Trudeau and his successors.\n\nAs a result of that, we had Stephen Harper for a decade who, although not perfect, was a saint compared with Trudeau.\n\nThe economy is tanking in Canada, and goods and services are becoming prohibitively expensive for average people. Trudeau and his cronies can appeal to idealism and progressivism all they want, but even left-wingers get ticked off and want change when they are struggling to fill the tank.\n\nUltimately, Trudeau is continuing to trap vaccine-free Canadians from participating fully in society because he knows that if he pulls the plug on his last failing restriction, that his regime will go down the drain.\n\nKennedy Hall is an Ontario based journalist for LifeSiteNews.

Jody Hice (R-Ga.), in all caps. A Twitter survey by Sen. Ted Cruz asked if Musk’s purchase was a good thing, with the only options to answer being “yes” or “no, I hate free speech.” His fellow Texan, Rep. John Carter, signaled his approval with no words at all; three clapping-hands emojis were sufficient.\n\nA pot-smoking, meme-posting evangelist for electric vehicles may be an unlikely hero for conservatives. But the Tesla chief executive’s amorphous vow to restore free speech to the social media platform has resonated among Republicans, who see themselves — starting with their de facto leader, former President Trump — as unfairly targeted by Twitter’s content moderation efforts.\n\nConservatives said their euphoric outpouring was bigger than the possible return of @RealDonaldTrump and changes to Twitter’s ownership. Rather, they see Musk’s takeover as a symbolic, and cathartic, blow against Big Tech, which the right has increasingly viewed with antipathy.\n\n“There’s a gut reaction from a lot of people, going, ‘You know what, it’s about time they get their comeuppance,’ ” said Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.). “It finally feels like someone is standing up for a principle that has been going in an opposite direction lately: less free speech, less ability to express yourself — if you are a conservative.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk centered his bid for Twitter on the premise that the social media company, which he considers a “digital town square,” is too restrictive in clamping down on expression.\n\n“I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” Musk tweeted Monday morning.\n\nMusk’s own politics are idiosyncratic. He’s the foremost face of clean vehicles who called for immediately increasing oil and gas production after the Ukraine-Russia war spiked energy prices. He fled California for Texas because of high taxes but declined to weigh in on Texas’ restrictive abortion law, saying he preferred to “stay out of politics.” He has described himself as politically independent and registered to vote in California with no party preference.\n\nFor conservatives, Musk’s crusade against content restrictions has struck a chord. Roughly half of Republicans feel they cannot express themselves freely on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, according to a Morning Consult poll conducted this month, far exceeding the percentage of Democrats and independents who felt similarly.\n\nPolitics Who did Twitter ban during the Trump era, and why? Could banned Trump allies return to Twitter under Elon Musk? A look at the former president’s backers who were kicked off the social media platform.\n\n“Twitter is a platform that I and many others believe has been more aggressive in blocking Republicans and conservatives than they have toward people on the left,” said Rep. Austin Scott (R-Ga.). “I’m hoping and expecting he will undo that.”\n\nScott is not an avid Twitter user; he does not even have the app on his phone. But he did tweet a congratulatory message to Musk, adding a plea to “restore free speech and bring back President Trump!”\n\nTrump was permanently kicked off the platform on Jan. 8, 2021 — two days after a group of his supporters overran the U.S. Capitol in hopes of blocking the certification of Joe Biden’s win. Twitter imposed the ban “due to the risk of further incitement of violence.”\n\nSo far, Musk has not indicated how he’d handle the former president’s account. Trump, meanwhile, has shown no interest in rejoining the platform that helped power his political rise and gave real-time narration of his presidency.\n\n“I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,” Trump told Fox News, referring to his fledgling social media network. “I hope Elon buys Twitter, because he’ll make improvements to it, and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth.”\n\nRepublicans see Trump as just one example of Twitter’s bias. A number of high-profile conservatives have been suspended or blocked from the platform, including the account of the Babylon Bee, a satirical news website that was suspended for a tweet naming Assistant Health Secretary Rachel Levine, who is transgender, “Man of the Year.”\n\nThe account was locked as a violation of Twitter’s ban on hate speech. Seth Dillon, CEO of Babylon Bee, refused to remove the tweet, asserting that “truth is not hate speech.”\n\n“It’s completely broken,” said Harmeet Dhillon, a conservative lawyer who has sued Twitter multiple times on behalf of clients who were banned. “The company can try to affect elections, try to ban politicians from speaking ... use algorithms, enable false accounts to constantly affect what people see.”\n\nThe extent to which conservatives face bias on the platform has been fiercely examined and debated. A study this month by researchers at MIT and Yale found that Republican users tend to be suspended more often than Democrats but that conservatives are more likely to share misinformation that would provoke such suspensions.\n\nSo far, Musk has offered little explanation as to how his free speech values would play out in practice. He said on Monday that his goals include “enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots and authenticating all humans.”\n\nBut such efforts would require some attempt at regulating content, especially by verifying users. A social media network without any moderation at all could swamp the platform with all sorts of unsavory or offensive material, such as pornography or terrorist content, as well as the online abuse and harassment that are already common occurrences.\n\n“If you don’t have content moderation, you actually have less free speech. The people who are the loudest are the bullies and harassers that drive people away,” said Katie Harbath, a former Republican operative who has worked as public policy director for Facebook.\n\nDhillon, the conservative attorney based in California, said she is not hoping for Musk to completely abandon regulation.\n\n“There’s plenty of room for them to do old-school content moderation of the kind they originally did,” she said, citing as an example prohibitions on making death threats.\n\nWith Musk’s plans still unknown, Harbath, who now runs a tech policy strategy firm, said the celebratory conservatives “are making a hell of a lot of assumptions of what Elon means by all this stuff. I don’t think they should assume he is completely on their side.”\n\nRepublicans’ triumphant tone on Twitter starkly contrasted with the more muted reaction from liberal politicians. Far fewer Democratic members of Congress weighed in on Twitter, although those who did were markedly unenthused.\n\n“This deal is dangerous for our democracy. Billionaires like Elon Musk play by a different set of rules than everyone else, accumulating power for their own gain. We need a wealth tax and strong rules to hold Big Tech accountable,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), with whom Musk has sparred on Twitter.\n\nHuizenga, the Michigan congressman, expected that liberals would be none too pleased with Musk’s purchase. Indeed, some vowed to leave the site entirely — much to Huizenga’s amusement.\n\n“It seems like ‘I’m quitting Twitter’ has become the ‘I’m moving to Canada if Trump wins,’ ” he said, adding, “It’s kind of fun sitting back, watching them completely lose their collective minds.”', 'image': 'https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ac14b68/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2941x1544+0+208/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F86%2F23%2Ff46440b54bd7a6509db9c67caab5%2Fphilanthropy-billionaries-tax-28080.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:57'}

(Patrick Pleul/Pool/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nElon Musk Reveals More Details of His Plans for Twitter After Buyout\n\nElon Musk revealed more details of what he has in mind for changes at Twitter after it was confirmed that the company had accepted his buyout offer, with the tech mogul’s plans including new features and ways to enhance trust in the platform.\n\nTwitter’s board of directors said on April 25 that it had approved Musk’s offer to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share in cash, in a deal worth around $44 billion.\n\nThe buyout represents a 38 percent premium over Twitter’s closing stock price on April 1, with Parag Agrawal, CEO of Twitter, saying in a statement that he believes the deal “is the best path forward for Twitter’s stockholders.”\n\n‘Bedrock of a Functioning Democracy’\n\nIn a statement, Musk provided some details about what kind of changes he has in mind for the social media platform, whose commitment to free speech he has repeatedly called into question.\n\n“Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,” Musk said. This dovetails with his earlier statements that Twitter functions as a “de facto town square” where important conversations should be able to take place with as few constraints as possible.\n\nMusk said Monday that Twitter has “tremendous potential” and that he wants to work with the company and its users to “unlock” and make the platform “better than ever.”\n\nHe said he plans on “enhancing” Twitter with new features, which he did not provide further details on. Musk earlier created a Twitter poll asking users if they want an edit button on the platform, suggesting that this could be one of the changes he is seeking to effect.\n\nMusk also said on Monday he wants to make the platform’s algorithms “open source to increase trust,” while “defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.”\n\nThis, too, reinforces his earlier remarks that his objective in seeking to buy Twitter and turn it into a private company was to transform it into a bastion of free speech by opening up its algorithm to public scrutiny and by making its moderation policies more transparent.\n\n‘Black Box Algorithm’\n\nA self-described “free speech absolutist,” Musk told the audience at a recent TED event in Vancouver, Canada, that Twitter should permit unconstrained expression, though it should do so in line with the law.\n\n“In my view, Twitter should match the laws of the country,” Musk said, acknowledging reasonable legal caps on free speech like direct incitement to violence or shouting “fire” in a crowded theater.\n\n“But going beyond that and having it be unclear who’s making what changes to where, having tweets mysteriously be promoted and demoted with no insight into what’s going on, having a black box algorithm promote some things and not other things, I think this can be quite dangerous,” Musk said.\n\n“My strong, intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization,” he added.\n\nErr on Side of Free Speech\n\nMusk also expressed reluctance about permanent bans of users from Twitter, preferring instead temporary “time-outs.”\n\n“I’m not saying that I have all the answers here,” Musk said at the TED talk. But I do think that we want to be just very reluctant to delete things, just be very cautious with permanent bans. Timeouts I think are better than permanent bans.”\n\nIn terms of calibrating Twitter’s moderation policies, Musk said he’d want to err on the side of free speech.\n\n“If in doubt, let the speech, let it exist,” Musk said. “If it’s a grey area, I would say let the tweet exist. But obviously in a case where there’s perhaps a lot of controversy, that you would not want to necessarily promote that tweet.”\n\n“A good sign as to whether there’s free speech is, is someone you don’t like allowed to say something you don’t like,” Musk said. “And if that is the case, then we have free speech.”\n\n‘We Are Concerned’\n\nMusk has repeatedly questioned Twitter’s commitment to free speech, after accusations that the platform suppressed some minority and politically conservative viewpoints, claims Twitter has denied.\n\nMany free speech advocates have hailed Musk’s takeover bid, while those opposed have expressed fear that fewer constraints on expression on Twitter will make it too easy to abuse the platform’s reach and power by, for example, spreading disinformation.\n\nIn a series of tweets reacting to Musk’s takeover moves, Amnesty International expressed concern about the erosion of policies meant to protect users.\n\n“We are concerned with any steps that Twitter might take to erode enforcement of the policies and mechanisms designed to protect users,” Amnesty International wrote.\n\n“The last thing we need is a Twitter that wilfully turns a blind eye to violent and abusive speech against users,” the group said.\n\nAs it was confirmed Musk would purchase Twitter, the Tesla founder urged his “worst critics” to stay on the platform.\n\n“I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” he wrote in a Twitter post.\n\nDan Ives, an analyst at investment firm Wedbush Securities, told the BBC that he expects most users will take a “wait-and-see approach” on whether they stay or leave the platform, based on the changes that take place.\n\n“Now it’s about courting new users and stopping defectors from the platform,” Ives told the outlet.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/19/article-image-cal-thomas-3-1200x804.jpeg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:50'}

I really believe that they\'re sick people," Trump responded.\n\nWhen asked if he misses Twitter, Trump declined to answer, instead promoting his own social media platform, Truth Social, though many have criticized the app\'s reliability in the first two months since it launched.\n\n"But we need a voice," Trump said. "The good news is I have a voice because I do interviews."\n\nHe added that since he was banned, Twitter has now become "boring."\n\nSome have speculated that Trump\'s account could be reinstated after Musk purchased the platform Monday for about $44 billion, a possibility that has excited some conservatives.\n\nTrump\'s active use of Twitter became a hallmark of his presidency, with his tweets often landing him in hot water. But concerns about potential violence prompted the company—as well as other social media platforms—to ban him after the Capitol riot.\n\nMusk has not yet said whether he would move to unban Trump. But in the past, Musk has advocated for "free speech" on the platform.\n\n"Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated," he said in a joint statement with Twitter following his purchase.\n\nEven if his account were no longer banned, Trump may not make a return.\n\n"Twitter\'s become very boring. They\'ve gotten rid of a lot of good voices on Twitter, a lot of their conservative voices," he said during a recent interview with SiriusXM\'s Americano Media.\n\nDevin Nunes, the CEO of Trump Media & Technology Group, also said Monday that Trump would likely not make a Twitter return.\n\n"Well, I can only report what he said. He said he really doesn\'t have an interest in going on Twitter, and my guess is that would continue to be the same," Nunes said during a Fox News interview.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Twitter for comment.', 'image': 'https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2026561/trump-calls-twitter-mentally-ill-ban.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:01'}

This feels like the first flashback scene we see in a dystopian drama after the words “SIX MONTHS EARLIER …” Quite where we’ll be in six months’ time as far as Twitter is concerned remains tantalisingly unclear, but it seems difficult to imagine it will be either a more or less pleasant space. It’s a social media platform. I’m not sure what further evidence humanity needs before we cotton on to the idea that such a thing might be an intrinsically toxic concept. Of course, there will always be some people who think it just hasn’t been done right yet. Like communism, or a British version of The Daily Show.\n\nAnyway, if Musk’s takeover goes through, he’ll assume control of a platform where the people on the right are incredibly angry about free speech, and those on the left are incredibly angry about hate speech. Which is to say: they have so much in common. As the tech visionary Jaron Lanier has long been excellent at pointing out, the best way to keep people on platforms is to make them angry. So the platforms are designed to make them angry. You might consider the anger worth it for your version of advertising (I myself will post this column on Twitter), but even then it is a weirdly grim cost of doing business that just conceivably ought to be weighed far more carefully than it is.\n\nUnlike the UK, Musk manufactures other things besides anger, but Twitter is the platform where, in a single calendar year, his posts led to multiple lawsuits, a fall in his stock price, and a Securities and Exchange Commission settlement that resulted in his chairmanship of Tesla being forcibly ended. Yet in a move that will feel familiar to a lot of Twitter users, he has not logged off, but leaned in further. When I was a child, there was a guy called Victor Kiam who owned Remington, and he would personally feature in the firm’s electric razor adverts, going: “I liked the shaver so much, I bought the company.” It would be nice to see Musk do something similar. “I liked calling innocent people paedos so much, I bought the company.”\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the distress of Twitter users feels overplayed. Perhaps Elon embodies a kind of radical honesty and self-awareness not shared by other denizens of the site. People who seem to spend half their lives complaining about Twitter, on Twitter, seem stunned by the idea that a shitposter would ultimately buy it. Catch up! It doesn’t feel like a complete coincidence that all social media platforms are owned by men you’d run a mile from socially.\n\nMusk is one of them – a brilliant, horrid, ridiculous and very occasionally endearing grotesque. A sort of intergalactically successful Dominic Cummings. And yet, despite Elon’s give-a-toss gift for making himself what Twitter users might call the “main character”, I can’t detest him entirely. If he pulls off the radical green energy transition embodied in Tesla, or even just one of his other wildly ambitious schemes, humans might have to accept some of the shit that’s gone with it. Accept it angrily, of course – how else, we’re on a social media platform! – but accept it nonetheless. A huge number of other people in public life behave appallingly and achieve absolutely nothing but harm.\n\nBut if endlessly righteous folk balk at the mere idea of necessary evils, why do they act like their own involvement in Twitter is one? It isn’t. It’s easy to focus on the high-profile people who are always on Twitter. But the sheer numbers of highly successful, highly creative and highly interesting people in the worlds of arts, business, science and beyond who AREN’T on it should tell a much more powerful story. They are part of all kinds of era-defining creative and commercial conversations and breakthroughs – and somehow manage to do it all without lavishing half the day scrolling past a bunch of other people having a row.\n\nLanier has cast detailed doubt on whether most Twitter advocacy is even meaningfully effective, despite sometimes appearing to be so. If you spend your day caught up in online fighting, it’s preferable to tell yourself you’re involved in consciousness-raising for your cause. An alternative view is that you are simply obsessively polarising your particular debate, to the point where compromise – boring, unfashionable, yet historically always necessary – becomes a more distant possibility.\n\nMy “unpopular opinion”, in one of Twitter’s tellingly popular phrases, is that those who spend a significant amount of time arguing on it work for the platform and not for their cause. The Musk takeover at least makes it easier to see whose pocket you’re putting money into as you delude yourself you’re winning arguments. I’m certainly not saying I follow this rule, but in general I think arguing on the internet is like playing real tennis: even if you win, you’re still a twat.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5899b28a3a52d992407b1aa95d2689c2b1d4703f/0_273_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=e4d7eefe6e510bd81cf93360935a1d81', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:53'}

Twitter said that after reviewing Trump\'s tweets and the context surrounding them, it decided to permanently suspend his account "due to the risk of further incitement of violence."\n\nThe former president used his Twitter account in the weeks between the 2020 presidential election and the January 6 insurrection to encourage his supporters to gather in Washington in protest of the election, which he falsely claimed was rigged against him.\n\nTrump does not yet use Truth Social, though Devin Nunes, a former congressman from California who serves as the CEO of the Trump Media and Technology Group, said that\'s "coming soon."\n\n"President Trump has no reason to go back to Twitter, and why would we want to go and be reliant on anyone?" Nunes told Fox News\' "Fox & Friends" in an interview Tuesday.\n\nHe and other Republicans have accused sites like Twitter and Facebook of censoring conservative voices and have called for the repeal of a 1996 law that shields social media companies from being held liable for content posted by their users.\n\nTwitter announced Monday that it reached an agreement with Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, to buy the company. The deal values the company at roughly $44 billion. Once the transaction is completed, Twitter will become privately held.\n\n"Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated," Musk, who has 85 million followers, said in a statement.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/04/22/189f3788-015e-485b-b413-778f7a5d703d/thumbnail/1200x630g2/9b65fe3dabaa3d87353c5c5fda069a17/ap22103558941419.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:57'}

REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz\n\nAttorney General Tight-Lipped on Hunter Biden Investigation\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland told lawmakers “there will not be interference,” but declined to say whether he has been briefed on the federal tax investigation into Hunter Biden by the U.S. attorney’s office in Delaware.\n\nGarland was questioned about the federal investigation into Biden by Sens. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) and Mike Braun (R-Ind.) at an April 26 Senate Committee on Appropriations hearing.\n\n“As I said during my nomination hearing, the investigation is being run by and supervised by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware. He [David Weiss] is supervising the investigation, and I’m not at liberty to talk about internal DOJ deliberations—but he is in charge of that investigation, and there will not be interference of any political or improper kind,” Garland said, also declining to comment on whether other senior DOJ officials have been briefed.\n\nHagerty expressed skepticism at Garland’s promise, given recent statements from the White House regarding Hunter Biden’s innocence.\n\n“I wonder why the president is resorting to go to TV and … his surrogates. Earlier this month, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain said on TV that the president is confident that his son didn’t break the law, and the White House communications director said President Biden maintains his position that his son did nothing that was unethical,” Hagerty said.\n\nThe senator asked Garland whether U.S. President Joe Biden had told him his son is innocent.\n\n“Absolutely not,” Garland responded. “He has not done that, and he has committed to not interfere in the investigation.”\n\nHagerty pressed further, asking Garland how the public could be confident there won’t be political interference in the investigation.\n\n“Because we put a Trump appointee in charge of the investigation,” Garland said, referring to Weiss. “And because you have me as attorney general, who’s committed to the independence of the DOJ from any influence from the White House.”\n\nHagerty then asked Garland whether the DOJ was considering assigning a special counsel to investigate Hunter Biden. Garland again declined to comment.\n\nWhen asked under what circumstances a special counsel would be used in the investigation, Garland said, “it depends on the circumstances.”\n\nBraun asked similar questions about a potential special counsel and received similar responses.\n\n“The question is an internal DOJ matter,” Garland repeated. “I don’t want to make judgments, but I’m comfortable with the Attorney from Delaware continuing.”\n\nThe federal investigation into Hunter Biden’s finances was revealed in December 2020, and few updates have been provided since then.\n\nAttorney Clint Lancaster, who represented an Arkansas woman who filed the lawsuit in 2019 alleging that Hunter Biden was the father of her daughter Navy Joan Roberts, told CBS News earlier this month that federal prosecutors subpoenaed the documents from his case.\n\n“They wanted every record relating to Hunter Biden we had,” he said of the paternity case, which was settled in 2020.\n\nLancaster said the records included Hunter Biden’s “affidavit of financial means” during the paternity lawsuit. A financial affidavit is generally a statement showing income, expenses, assets, and liabilities.\n\nAdditionally, he said the tax records he and Roberts provided overlapped during the same time period as Hunter Biden’s foreign business activities.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/1.tagreuters.com2022binary_LYNXNPEI3510J-FILEDIMAGE-1200x833.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:47'}

Bill Hagerty (R-TN) asked Garland if he knew of the probe into the president’s son. Garland refused to reveal any internal deliberations against Hunter but noted the investigation is being run by David Weiss, a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nWeiss, a 20-year federal prosecutor, will have to determine if there is enough evidence to seek a federal grand jury indictment against Hunter Biden in an investigation that may end up including other members of the Biden family, such as Joe Biden’s brother James Biden, and potentially the president himself.\n\n“I’m aware of that, but he reports to you,” Hagerty pressed about the investigation under Weiss.\n\n“He is supervising the investigation and I’m not at liberty to talk about internal Justice Department deliberations, but he is in charge of that investigation,” Garland reiterated.\n\nGarland then promised the Biden administration would not interfere in the investigation. “There will not be interference of any political or improper kind.”\n\nHagerty continued his line of questioning by asking if Joe Biden ever told Garland that Hunter did not break any laws, including tax fraud, money laundering, and violation of lobbying laws.\n\n“Absolutely not. And the President has not done that. And the President is committed not to interfere, not only in that investigation but any other kind of investigation,” Garland claimed.\n\nLater in the hearing, Garland refused to say whether a special counsel should be placed over the investigation to maintain a just investigation. A special counsel would provide a degree of separation between Biden’s administration and the investigation. Legal experts have said a special counsel is necessary because Joe Biden has denied any wrongdoing by Hunter and may have influenced the ongoing investigation.\n\n“The question of whether they have a special counsel is one that is an internal decision-making within the department, so I don’t want to make any judgments one way or the other,” Garland responded. “But I’m quite comfortable with the United States attorney for that district continuing in the role that he’s [Weiss] playing.”\n\nDuring the 2020 presidential debate, Joe Biden claimed Hunter’s “laptop from hell” was a Russian plant “and a smear campaign.” Joe Biden has repeatedly claimed he was never involved in the family business.\n\nJoe Biden said the emails on Hunter’s laptop were a “Russian plant” and “a smear campaign.” Today new emails indicate that Biden was PAYING Hunter’s bills for a deal with a Chinese government-controlled entity. pic.twitter.com/K3Ojf3SyIg — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) April 26, 2022\n\nBut according to White House visitor logs obtained by the New York Post on Saturday, Hunter’s corrupt business partner, Eric Schwerin, met with Joe Biden at the White House 19 times between 2009 and 2015. Joe Biden was vice president during this time. The contact between Joe Biden and Schwerin directly contradicts Joe Biden’s repeated claims he was never involved in the family business. The Post’s reporting adds a twelfth instance Joe Biden has been involved in the family’s business scheme.\n\nDOOCY: "The President has said that he never spoke to his son about his overseas business dealings.

Sixty percent say Hunter Biden has sold “influence and access” to Joe Biden. The poll also shows 67 percent believe Joe Biden should be impeached if he “secretly participated and facilitated” in the family’s business.\n\nText messages from 2019 on Hunter’s “laptop from hell” depict the Biden family payout mechanism.

But don’t worry, unlike Pop [Joe], I won’t make you give me half your salary.”\n\nThe Biden’s family payment mechanism of collecting 50 percent of family salaries for 30 years could be legal “predicates” for racketeering charges, according to former Utah U.S. attorney Brett Tolman.\n\nFollow Wendell Husebø on Twitter and Gettr @WendellHusebø.

Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.) told reporters following the meeting.\n\n“We are in a different position now than we were in the past,” he said. “There’s ample vaccines available. There is the ability to test and quarantine that work. And so, Title 42 should be lifted, and that we should focus on border management policy in order to make sure that they have the resources in order to move forward.”\n\nBut the administration’s plans to stop enforcing Title 42 were thrown into doubt as the meeting came to a close. A Trump-appointed federal judge in Louisiana said he planned to block the administration’s plans for rescinding the public health order, a win for a group of GOP-led states who sued to stop Biden from moving forward.\n\nThe meeting punctuated internal disagreement in the Democratic Party around the Biden administration’s decision to end enforcement of the Title 42 authority, a public health order that allows border officials to speedily turn away migrants at the U.S. southern border.\n\nImmigration advocates have a litany of concerns about the policy, but at the center of those issues is that it allows officials to forego asylum screenings, blocking persecuted migrants from exercising a right they have under U.S. law.\n\nWhile many support the Biden administration’s decision and indeed wish it had come sooner, others have expressed concern about the plans amid a prolonged spike in border crossings.\n\n“Yes they’re listening to the immigration activists, but my question is who’s listening to the men and women in green and in blue and, more importantly, who is listening to the border communities – the sheriffs, the landowners, the rest of the people who live on the border?” Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), who represents a border community and has raised concerns about the policy decision, said on “Fox News Sunday.”\n\nRep. Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.), who was tasked with presenting the group’s position on Title 42 to Biden, said the meeting touched on a series of issues before turning to immigration, an issue that still led coverage of the meeting.\n\n“The reality is when you talk to Latinos they’re talking about the economy, jobs, air pollution, and so the media is talking about things that are divisive,” said Barragán.\n\nBarragán added that the CHC puts more blame over the immigration policy crisis on former President Trump than on Biden.\n\n“The bottom line is this president walked into a tough situation with a prior administration who dismantled the legal immigration system,” she said.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the meeting was part of Biden’s outreach to individual congressional caucuses. Biden has recently met with the Congressional Progressive Caucus as well as other groups in Congress.\n\nAttendees said that it also covered the implementation of the bipartisan infrastructure law, immigration reform, and environmental justice.\n\nAt one point, an aide to the president walked into the room with a note saying the 30-minute meeting had gone on for 62 minutes.\n\nBiden, rather than keep the information to himself, read the note out loud to laughter from the attendees.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House is facing pressure from immigration advocates to forcefully oppose a bill that has attracted support from moderate senators that would delay an end to the enforcement of Title 42. The White House has not taken a position on the legislation.\n\n“I just wish that the Biden administration would stand up and explain what it’s doing and own it,” said Clara Long, associate director at Human Rights Watch who focuses on immigration and border policy.\n\nPsaki again on Monday said it would be up to Congress to make any changes to CDC’s Title 42 enforcement, but she declined to say whether Biden would sign legislation that did so.\n\n“This would be Congress having the discussion. We are continuing to prepare for a May 23 implementation,” Psaki said. “There will be a range of conversations about this over the coming days.”\n\nThe lawsuits filed by GOP-led states seem to be the biggest immediate threat to the administration’s plans. Some have speculated that the White House would like to see the courts thwart their plans in order to take a hot-button political issue off Biden’s plate.\n\n“I think there’s a theory going around that they’re hoping the courts give them a get-out-of-jail-free card,” said Long.\n\nBiden’s approval ratings are particularly low on his handling of immigration.\n\nA Politico/Morning Consult poll conducted earlier this month found that 54 percent of registered voters oppose Biden’s decision to lift Title 42.\n\nBut a different poll conducted in February by Impact Research for the National Immigration Law Center found that 52 percent of likely 2022 voters support ending Title 42 enforcement.\n\nStill, most CHC members believe that the administration can push forward with its vision of border policy, because Republicans are unlikely to relent from attacking Biden on immigration and the border.\n\n“No matter what the president does, they’re going to make noise. The president and the Democratic-controlled Congress have done amazing things, that’s why econ has improved,” said Rep. Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.), who attended the meeting.\n\n“Republicans don’t want to focus on the glass that’s half full, they want to convince us the glass is half empty,” he added.\n\nSome advocates for ending the policy, which they say represented one prong of the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant agenda, argue that Democrats are risking turning off their base by voicing support for continuing the policy.\n\n“This is a policy that can help you win and the flipside of that is embracing the Republican talking points is not going to help you win those Democratic voters that you desperately need to turn out for you in November,” said Bri Gillis, political director of the National Immigration Law Center’s Immigrant Justice Fund.\n\nStill, some Democrats say the discussion of Title 42 is moot.\n\n“There’s nothing to debate, you’re either for Title 42 or you’re not,” said Rep. Lou Correa (D-Calif.), a CHC member who did not attend the meeting.\n\n“Everybody’s talking abt Title 42 when that’s not the issue. The real issue is American industrial might, nearshoring of American jobs from China, creating a stronger manufacturing base, and a lot of that relies on immigrants. And we’re talking about Title 42. Doesn’t even come close to addressing the bigger public policy issues in this country and that’s what everybody’s talking about. And it’s hurting us,” said Correa.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/ruizraul_031821gn_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:41'}

They stole this election. We all know. They will destroy our country next.”\n\nThe message about Trump potentially invoking martial law, earlier reported by CNN on Monday and confirmed by the Guardian, came a month after the idea had been raised in a heated Oval Office meeting a month before, where Trump considered ways to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nMeadows did not appear to respond to Greene’s text. But the messages Trump’s top White House aide was receiving shows the extraordinary ideas swirling around Trump after he and his operatives were unable to stop the certification of Biden’s election win on January 6.\n\nGreene – one of Trump’s fiercest far-right defenders on Capitol Hill – also texted Meadows days before the Capitol attack asking about how to prepare for objections to Biden’s win at the joint session of Congress, the text messages show.\n\n“Good morning Mark, I’m here in DC. We have to get organized for the 6th,” Greene wrote on 31 December. “I would like to meet with Rudy Giuliani again. We didn’t get to speak with him long. Also anyone who can help. We are getting a lot of members on board.”\n\nThat text message from Greene, who had not yet been sworn in as a member of Congress, a week before the Capitol attack also underscores her close relationship with the Trump White House and an extraordinary level of coordination to obstruct Biden being certified as president.\n\nBut the text messages that Meadows did not turn over to the select committee – as opposed to the communications he agreed to produce for the investigation – were perhaps more notable as the panel investigates connections between the White House and the Capitol attack.\n\nThe panel is aware, for instance, that Meadows had contacts through December 2020 and January 2021 with organizers of the Save America rally at the Ellipse that descended into the Capitol attack as well as with Trump campaign officials, say sources close to the inquiry.\n\nYet none of the text messages Meadows produced to the select committee through a cooperation deal agreed last year and in response to a subpoena show any such contacts, raising the specter that he might have deliberately withheld some communications.\n\nThe former White House chief of staff appears to have ultimately turned over no text messages between 9 December and 21 December, a critical time period in the lead-up to the Capitol attack during which a number of key moments took place.\n\nMeadows appeared to be aware of efforts by the White House and others, for instance, to send fake Trump slates of electors to Congress. The idea was to have “dueling” slates of electors force then-vice president Mike Pence to discount those votes and return Trump to office.\n\nThat scheme – which the select committee believes was coordinated in part by the Trump White House, the sources said – appeared to occur on 14 December, the deadline under the Electoral Count Act for states to send electoral college votes to Congress.\n\nMeadows also was in close contact with Trump’s attorney Rudy Giuliani and others after the contentious Oval Office meeting with Trump on 18 December, as he sought to bar onetime Trump campaign lawyer and conspiracy theorist Sidney Powell from the White House.\n\nBut Meadows appears to have turned over no text messages from that crucial period, as allies of the former president started to set their sights on January 6, including the Stop the Steal movement that started to plan a protest at the Capitol around that time.\n\nThe seeming omission may be explained in part by the fact that Meadows was communicating about those plans on his personal cell phone – against which the select committee issued a subpoena contested by Meadows in federal court as “overly broad”.\n\nThe absence of messages between 9 December and 21 December may also be explained more straightforwardly by the fact that Meadows did not receive any messages during that period. Meadows’ lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nHouse investigators are not convinced they have been given all the text messages relevant to their subpoena, according to one source with knowledge of the matter, and expect to continue pursuing Meadows’ documents and personal communications in court.\n\nIn a motion for summary judgment with respect to Meadows’ records, the select committee said in a 248-page court filing late on Friday that it believed Meadows’ claims for withholding material from the investigation on grounds of executive privilege were baseless.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfe079c4faec28229651078fa1ef1445f13623c9/0_149_4504_2704/master/4504.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bb0615f20d2d295d9c507d24a68b0912', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:54'}

She returned to Washington on Monday.\n\nHarris “will isolate and continue to work from the Vice President’s residence,” Kirsten Allen, her spokesperson, said in a statement. “The Vice President will return to the White House when she tests negative.”\n\nHarris had avoided catching the virus for months, despite close contacts testing positive. Jamal Simmons, her communications director, announced a positive result earlier this month; Harris’ husband, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, contracted the virus in March.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe vice president’s positive tests could create governing concerns given that Harris is the first in line of presidential succession to Biden, 79. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), second in line, announced a positive test earlier this month.\n\nHarris, 57, has been vaccinated and boosted twice. The shots greatly diminish the chances of her becoming seriously ill. When former President Trump, 75, was hospitalized with COVID-19 in October 2020, he was at much higher risk, given his age and the lack of available vaccines. Trump has said he has since been vaccinated and boosted.\n\nWhite House officials have said that they expect Biden will catch the virus, but he has not been avoiding events with crowds. He is scheduled to attend the White House Correspondents Assn. dinner Saturday and to speak at a memorial service Sunday for former Vice President Walter Mondale in Minneapolis.\n\n“Like many Americans, he makes risk assessments,” Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.\n\nHarris had initially planned to return to Washington from California, where she took some personal time and gave a speech about anti-satellite missiles and another about maternal health, on Tuesday. Her office would not say why she altered her travel plans to return a day earlier but noted that she was not experiencing any symptoms before testing positive.\n\nBecause she had not been expected in Washington until Tuesday, Harris had a light schedule, with no meetings in the morning and no public events all day, said Allen, the spokeswoman.\n\nHarris took a rapid antigen test Tuesday morning after going to work at the White House, Allen said. After that test came back positive, Allen said, Harris took a PCR test, a more accurate assessment that confirmed the rapid result. Harris left the White House for her residence at the U.S. Naval Observatory by motorcade.\n\nBiden and Harris later spoke by phone. “He wanted to check in and make sure she has everything she needs as she quarantines at home,” the White House said in a statement.\n\nThough Harris did not attend any formal meetings, the White House is still tracing her contacts to determine who may have been exposed to her. Even when they are not in formal meetings, vice presidents interact with an array of policy, communications and personal staff.\n\n“Should we identify a close a close contact, we will notify them as appropriate,” Allen said.\n\nHer office is also going through her schedule to see which public events and private meetings need to be canceled or shifted to a virtual setting.\n\nHarris plans to work from her residence for at least five days and will not return to the White House until she receives a negative test. Allen declined to say whether Harris would be taking any medication, adding that such decisions would be left to White House physicians.\n\nThe latest wave of COVID, sparked by the Omicron BA. 2 subvariants, has swept through official Washington in recent weeks, infecting many members of Congress and the executive branch. The White House rhetoric has shifted from preventing infections to promoting vaccines, boosters and therapeutics.\n\n“It is going to be hard to ensure that no one gets COVID in America,” Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House’s coronavirus coordinator, told reporters Tuesday. “That’s not even a policy. The goal of our policy should be obviously to minimize infections whenever possible, but to make sure people don’t get seriously ill. The best ways of doing that are make sure people are vaccinated and boosted as the vice president is and making sure we have plenty of therapeutics.”\n\nMinutes after Harris announced her result, two Democratic members of the Senate — Ron Wyden of Oregon and Chris Murphy of Connecticut — announced they too had contracted what they believed to be mild forms of the virus.\n\n“It’s a bummer, but I’m sure if I wasn’t fully vaccinated I would be feeling a lot worse. So remember to get your booster!” Murphy tweeted.\n\nSimmons, Harris’ communications director, tested positive for the virus after attending the April 2 Gridiron dinner, a traditional white-tie gathering of reporters and politicians that features light roasts and songs.\n\nAtty. Gen. Merrick Garland and Gina Raimondo, the secretary of Commerce, announced positive test results following the dinner, as did Reps. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank) and Joaquin Castro (D-Texas).\n\nAll of them had been vaccinated, and none became seriously ill.\n\nHarris’ positive tests come as the administration has tried to push the country toward normalcy, eliminating mask requirements in many settings and returning to public gatherings. A federal judge in Florida took it a step further last week, overturning a federal requirement to wear masks on airplanes, trains and buses. The administration is appealing that ruling.\n\n“None of us can predict with any certainty where exactly this pandemic is going, what the virus is going to do next. All we can do is prepare,” Jha said, urging Congress to pass another round of funding to combat the virus.\n\nStaff writer Eli Stokols contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n', 'image': 'https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ab3b3ac/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffb%2Fff%2Fcfc38a794c329c2a8d3684ababb9%2F947026-na-pol-0421-vp-cali-trip-kkn-25884.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:57'}

The former House member, who is the first bisexual member of the Senate, 'joked with Democrats about how easy it was for her to charm Republican men,' according to the book.\n\n'Sinema, a fitness enthusiast who was 36 when she entered Congress, boasted knowingly to colleagues and aides that her cleavage had an extraordinary persuasive effect on the uptight men of the GOP.

He had called the Capitol riot in a Jan. 6th column a 'disgrace,' where he wrote that 'one point of the riot was to further pressure Pence (“Hang Mike Pence!”), but much of the lobbying took place behind closed doors, among Trump’s advisers.')\n\nTrump also took a shot at now Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.

After news of Musk’s takeover, news website Politico contacted several top Republican members and aides to gauge reaction to a potential Trump Twitter return.\n\n“Every single one of them told us that they hoped the former president stays the hell away from Twitter,” Politico reported.\n\nTrump himself has said he won’t be back, telling Fox News: “I am going to be staying on Truth.”\n\nThe twice-impeached former commander-in-chief is not known for his consistency, however. He has reportedly expressed discontent with how Truth Social has performed – “What the fuck is going on,” the Daily Beast reported Trump as asking aides in March – and to return to relevance, and to win back the spotlight he craves, the former president might need Twitter.\n\n“If he wants to intervene on behalf of a candidate he has now endorsed in the midterm elections, being able to reach that number of people with messages supporting those candidates is a way of essentially getting free advertising time to reach people who are more likely to vote as a result of getting a signal from Donald Trump,” Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, told Time.\n\nTrump may have insisted that he will snub Twitter and stick with Truth Social, but his commitment to his own platform has so far been tepid at best – Trump has posted on Truth Social just once.\n\nIf that lack of interaction hasn’t helped Truth Social, neither did the botched rollout on 21 February. Tens of thousands of people were unable to access the network – the Guardian was finally allowed in on 5 March – and by early April the Truth Social app was the 355th most popular on Apple devices.\n\nIn terms of daily active users, Truth Social had 513,000, the Daily Beast reported. Twitter has about 217 million.\n\nLack of usage – both by Trump and by the general public – is not the only problem the new network faces.\n\nShares in Digital World Acquisition Corporation, the firm which plans to merge with Trump Media & Technology Group, dropped 13% on Monday after news of Musk’s deal. Since Musk became the largest shareholder in Twitter TMTG shares have fallen by 44% overall, and two key Truth Social executives quit the platform in April.\n\nSince Trump was removed from Twitter his missives have been limited to email blasts sent from his Save America Pac, the messages frequently bleating about a “stolen election” in 2020. At the moment those emails are received by a mixture of supporters and vaguely interested journalists.\n\nIf Trump resumed tweeting, he’d have a far bigger audience for his misinformation – which could have serious consequences.\n\n“The real danger would come after election day,” Gertz said, “when he could use that same megaphone to spread lies about voter fraud as a pretext for overturning elections. If that happens, another January 6 – perhaps a more successful one – is very much in play.”', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a92109698abfe8cebc8ed79f918f6e0cb5a652cf/0_156_5131_3078/master/5131.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0c9734ab4bdc644afa8fecabe2eaf914', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:03'}

Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) has voiced his concern about “the frequency” he says Bedoya “has publicly expressed divisive views on policy matters.”\n\nThe Senate schedule was thrown into disarray Tuesday after Harris, Murphy and Wyden announced they had become infected.\n\nKirsten Allen, a spokeswoman for Harris, said the vice president will isolate and continue to work from her official residence and will return to the White House only after testing negative.\n\nMurphy announced around lunchtime that he had felt “mild symptoms overnight” and tested positive for the virus Tuesday morning.\n\n“We’ve done the contact tracing and let people know. It’s a bummer, but I’m sure if I wasn’t fully vaccinated I would be feeling a lot worse. So remember to get your booster!” he tweeted.\n\nWyden’s office issued a statement reporting that the senator had tested positive Tuesday “as part of routine testing” and plans to stay away from the Senate for the rest of the week.\n\n“He is in Washington, D.C., and working from his residence while following CDC guidance to quarantine,” Wyden’s office said.\n\nThe Senate will go ahead with a confirmation vote on Lael Brainard to serve as vice chair of the Fed’s board of governors scheduled for 2:15 p.m. Tuesday, and she is expected to be confirmed.\n\nFifty-four senators voted Monday afternoon to advance Brainard, including eight Republicans.\n\nSarah Bloom Raskin, Biden’s first choice to serve as the Federal Reserve’s vice chair of supervision, a key regulatory post, withdrew her nomination last month after encountering strong Republican opposition.\n\nHer nomination was doomed when centrist Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) said he wouldn’t support her.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/toomeypat_murphychris_031022gn_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:05'}

Those measures aim to make the services more appealing to advertisers seeking a safe venue, and to better accommodate politicians and regulators arguing that the platforms are responsible for all of their content. But the moves have alienated some users who, like Mr. Musk, say they go overboard.\n\nHow Twitter operates won’t be entirely up to Mr. Musk.\n\n“Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules—regardless of their shareholding,” Thierry Breton, the EU regulator, wrote Tuesday on Twitter. “Mr Musk knows this well.”\n\nMr. Breton expressed confidence that Twitter, under Mr. Musk’s ownership, would conform to the bloc’s new rules, which still need formal approval from the EU Parliament and representatives from EU countries.\n\nMr. Musk’s planned changes at Twitter, and the response, will be closely watched. Twitter is smaller and less profitable than other social-media companies. It claims 217 million so-called monetizable daily users compared with 1.9 billion daily users for Meta Platforms Inc.’s core Facebook platform and a billion-plus monthly users for TikTok. But Twitter users include media personalities, politicians, activists and tech aficionados who help shape social discourse.\n\n“It has influence way beyond its user base and way beyond its valuation, and so we care about it,” said David Kaye, former United Nations special rapporteur focused on free speech and now a law professor at the University of California, Irvine.\n\nTwitter’s existing content policies haven’t brought about huge financial success; it has struggled to deliver consistent profits. Photo: Laura Morton for The Wall Street Journal\n\nMr. Musk, chief executive of Tesla Inc. and Space Exploration Technologies Corp. as well as the world’s richest person, is one of Twitter’s most prominent users, employing the platform for everything from promoting his companies to battling rivals and critics. In Monday’s deal announcement, he said he wants to open up Twitter’s algorithms to public scrutiny, “defeat” spammers and authenticate users’ identities.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Musk said he views “free speech” as that permitted by the law—a far broader definition of what is allowable than most major social networks have adopted. “I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law,” he said in a tweet. “If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect. Therefore, going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people.”\n\nSome industry executives and analysts say Mr. Musk is in for an awakening. Reversing Twitter’s efforts risks stoking advertisers’ worries about the placement of their ads, potentially pushing them toward competitors like Snap Inc. and Meta, said Ben Black, co-head of internet research at Deutsche Bank.\n\nElon Musk struck a deal on Monday to buy Twitter for about $44 billion, moving the world’s richest man a step closer to taking control of the social-media platform.

The platform often took a hands-off approach even to content from officially designated terrorist groups, drawing criticism from researchers, lawmakers and victims’ families.\n\nIt stepped up moderation over the years, removing accounts connected to the terrorist group ISIS in 2014, for example. That accelerated during and after the 2016 U.S. presidential race, which saw a jump in complaints about white nationalists and others using the platform to attack and harass minority users.\n\nOther industry leaders who favored looser policies, including Meta co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, have gradually embraced more intervention. Platforms including Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest Inc. and Reddit Inc. all have added staff or bolstered rules to monitor their content, though each draws the lines differently.\n\nTheir efforts target a range of potentially problematic content, from hate speech and false information about elections to what they see as fringe views on health, along with other issues the platforms consider harmful. Pinterest recently banned posts that it deems to contain misinformation about climate change.\n\nTwitter and other platforms also have systems allowing users to report claims of abuse by other users, which can lead to account suspensions that some of those involved say can be arbitrary or unfair.\n\nMore moderating has required complex, and often confusing, guidelines for employees and users. Such efforts have led to some divisive decisions, including bans by Twitter and Facebook of then-President Donald Trump for posts encouraging the rioters who attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, seeking to halt certification of President Biden’s electoral victory.\n\nThose bans were widely praised on the left and by some Republicans. But Mr. Trump and his supporters blasted it and have backed rival social-media apps with fewer restrictions that so far have gained limited traction, including Parler, Gab, and Gettr, which former Trump adviser Jason Miller launched last year.\n\nMany in the Trump camp have voiced support for Mr. Musk’s planned Twitter acquisition, though Mr. Trump told Fox News on Monday that he doesn’t plan to return to the platform and would instead use his social-media startup, Truth Social.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up Technology A weekly digest of tech reviews, headlines, columns and your questions answered by WSJ's Personal Tech gurus. PREVIEW\n\nDevin Nunes, CEO of Truth Social, lauded Monday’s Twitter deal, though he said he doesn’t see the platform, even under Mr. Musk, as a direct competitor because of their different target audiences. “This is a great, great day,” the Trump ally and former GOP congressman said. “Finally we’re getting some movement in the right direction here in terms of opening the internet back up and giving people their voice back.”\n\nTwitter’s existing policies haven’t brought about huge financial success; it has struggled to deliver consistent profits. And losing advertisers might not be a problem for Mr. Musk. He has said he wants the platform to rely less on advertising—which accounts for about 90% of its revenue, totaling $5.1 billion last year—and to focus more on a subscription business model. The platform currently offers Twitter Blue, a $2.99-a-month subscription service that gives customers access to premium features.\n\nDespite Mr. Trump’s comments Monday, many observers and Twitter employees are focused on Mr. Musk’s handling of the former president’s account as a potential indicator of his plans. During an all-hands meeting on Monday, Twitter CEO Parag Agarwal was asked if the company might reinstate Mr. Trump once Mr. Musk’s ownership is completed. Mr. Agarwal said it wasn’t clear.\n\n—Patience Haggin contributed to this article.\n\nElon Musk and Twitter More coverage of the billionaire's bid for Twitter, selected by editors Latest Developments\n\nWrite to Deepa Seetharaman at Deepa.Seetharaman@wsj.com and Meghan Bobrowsky at Meghan.Bobrowsky@wsj.com", 'image': 'https://images.wsj.net/im-531039/social', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:07'}

He said that the book describes how “populist economic nationalism has arrived as a movement and why we need to embrace it.”\n\nIn 2021, Navarro published the book “In Trump Time: A Journal of America’s Plague Year,” which was ranked as a top-10 bestseller by USA Today and has been a bestseller on Amazon. Navarro previously noted that more than 200,000 copies of “In Trump Time” had been pre-sold, according to distributors, before it was available to the public.\n\nHowever, “In Trump Time” was omitted from The New York Times’ non-fiction bestseller list even though it should have been ranked at least third on the list from Nov. 21, 2021, Navarro said at the time, citing statistics published by Bookscan, the definitive industry source used for book rankings.\n\n“The New York Times in its cancel culture, virtue signaling, fascist world, did not put it on the list,” Navarro told The Epoch Times. “And that had a material harm to the sales of the book because people use that New York Times bestseller list as what we call in economics a ‘signal’ as to whether a book is worthy of purchase. So there was a great grassroots performance by the book itself. But my judgment, if we weren’t in a cancel culture world, we probably would have sold a million copies of that book.”\n\nIn response to Navarro’s allegations, Nicole Taylor, a communications director at The New York Times, told The Epoch Times in an email that the publication’s best-seller lists are “based on a detailed analysis of book sales from a wide range of retailers who provide us with specific and confidential context of their sales each week.”\n\nThe New York Times representative added that “sales data from our confidential panel of reporting stores is separate from what is reported to Bookscan or other entities” and that publication’s “Best Sellers department has reviewed the data they received for the sales week of November 21, 2021 and is confident in the accuracy of the Best-Seller Lists for that week.”\n\nNavarro, in an email response, called The New York Times’ statement a “misdirection,” saying that “In Trump Time” sold over 30,000 books during the week in question. “We sold twice as many books or more as half of the titles that appeared on the list,” he said.\n\nThe former official announced “Taking Back Trump’s America,” which is scheduled for release in September, while guest-hosting Stephen K. Bannon’s “War Room” podcast on April 15, and said “hands down the ‘War Room’ is the most powerful platform to sell thoughtful books to the American public. It really astonishes people, authors, publishers, when they go on the road and see how lettered the audience is.”\n\n“I’m counting also on publications like The Epoch Times,” he said. “My hope is that avid readers of The Epoch Times will embrace ‘Taking Back Trump’s America.’”\n\nNavarro revealed that The Epoch Times will be included in the book, saying, “I talk about The Epoch Times in glowing terms in the ‘Taking Back Trump’s America’ book with respect to how it’s grown rapidly from what was a niche publication to one of the most important international newspapers in the world.”\n\nThe former official projected large gains for the Republicans in November’s midterms, driven by growing dissatisfaction with what he described as increasingly radical Democratic policies.\n\n“I think a safe bet is a 60-seat swing [in favor of the Republican Party], which is similar to what happened to Obama with the Tea Party [movement] and when [Newt] Gingrich came along [in the 1994 midterm elections], but depending on how redistricting goes around the country, that could go as high as 80 and as low as 30 or 40,” Navarro said.\n\n“I think a large portion of the country now is united against the Democrat Party,” he added, describing its performance as showing that “it’s a radical political party.”\n\n“It’s really out of touch in the center of this country.”\n\nDespite Republican Party advantages heading into the midterms, Navarro noted that there are struggles between globalists and nationalists happening within the party.\n\n“It’s also true that there’s an important war going on now within the Republican Party between the party of Davos, Wall Street, multinational corporations that offshore our jobs versus the Trump Republicans who embrace secure borders, embrace fair rather than simply so-called free trade,” he said. “If we simply have a Republican majority with the current leadership in charge, Mitch McConnell in the Senate, Kevin McCarthy in the House, we’re going to have basically the status quo ante, and it will not serve the center of this country.”\n\nNavarro emphasized the distinction between “RINO,” an acronym for “Republican in Name Only,” and “Trump” Republicans.\n\n“The Karl Rove faction, the Wall Street faction, the Liz Cheney faction … Mitch McConnell, [Kevin] McCarthy, they’re all supporting RINO Republicans rather than Trump Republicans,” he said, adding that the Republican primaries will serve as a critical test to determine which camp prevails.\n\nA primary race that Navarro is particularly interested in is the Republican primary race in South Carolina’s 1st Congressional District between Trump-endorsed Katie Arrington and first-term incumbent Nancy Mace. Following the events of Jan. 6, 2021, and in what was her first speech on the floor of the House of Representatives, Mace, who had worked on the 2016 Trump campaign, blamed the president for the breach of the Capitol. A story was also posted to her official Congressional website that included “Mace Condemns President Trump” in the headline.\n\nMace is a poster child for the RINO, Rove, corporate media effort to stop the Trump movement,” Navarro told The Epoch Times. Trump endorsed primary challenger Katie Arrington in February, calling Mace “an absolutely terrible candidate” who “has been very disloyal to the Republican Party.”\n\nWhen reached for comment, Austin McCubbin, manager for Rep. Mace’s congressional campaign wrote in an e-mailed statement, “Conservative organizations all score Mace as having a near perfect voting record, because she doesn’t sacrifice her principles.”\n\nNavarro, in response, said in an email, “I was in the trenches with Katie Arrington in the Trump administration when we were fighting to save millions of lives at the start of the pandemic and she was a warrior.”\n\n“The only thing you need to know about Mace is she supported the Democrats effort to steal the election from Donald Trump,” he added.\n\nExecutive Privilege\n\nNavarro described how he is protecting executive privilege in the face of intense pressure from the Democrat-majority House committee investigating the events of Jan. 6.\n\nThe Trump aide refused to comply with a subpoena from the House committee, citing executive privilege. In a highly partisan vote this month, the House of Representatives voted to formally ask the Justice Department to prosecute Navarro and another top Trump adviser on criminal contempt charges for not complying with the subpoena.\n\nAfter the November 2020 presidential election when Trump and allies, including Navarro, alleged largescale election irregularities and fraud, Navarro coordinated what he calls the “Green Bay Sweep” strategy with Trump and Stephen Bannon, who previously served as Trump’s chief White House strategist. The Green Bay Sweep Strategy, named after a football play made famous by the Green Bay Packers, involved members of Congress formally contesting election results in six battleground states before the certification of presidential election results on Jan. 6.\n\nNavarro writes in his book “In Trump Time” regarding Jan. 6, “The political and legal beauty of the strategy was this: by law, both the House of Representatives and the Senate must spend up to two hours of debate per state on each requested challenge. For the six battleground states, that would add up to as much as twenty-four hours of nationally televised hearings across the two chambers of Congress. Through these televised proceedings, we would finally be able to short-circuit the crushing censorship of the anti-Trump media and take our case directly to the American people.”\n\nHe also writes of the event, “The goal is not to get the election overturned today. The goal is to subject the ballots—the legal votes of American citizens along with what we believe to be a flood of illegal ballots—to careful scrutiny and investigation.”\n\nNavarro explained his reasons for maintaining privilege during the House committee proceedings, and suggested that the matter may ultimately have to be resolved by the Supreme Court.\n\n“President Trump has asserted executive privilege, number one,” Navarro told The Epoch Times. “Number two, I informed the [House January 6] committee very clearly that it was not my privilege to waive, therefore I could not comply with their subpoena. And I directed them—and this is equally important—I directed them to negotiate directly with [Trump] and his attorneys for any partial or full waiver of the privilege, and then I would be happy to comply if President Trump himself or his attorneys negotiated something with them. It’s not my privilege to waive.”\n\nHe added, “Subsequent to that, the committee colluded either explicitly or tacitly with the Biden White House to do an end run around that direction, and they chose to have Biden take the legal step of waiving President Trump’s privilege in this matter. And that’s where things stand. So, there’s going to be ongoing legal activities related to that … But this is a Supreme Court decision waiting to happen, because the [House Jan. 6] committee itself is acting in an illegal manner.”\n\nThe White House and the House Jan. 6 committee did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nNavarro in late 2020 completed a report, “The Navarro Report,” documenting detailed evidence and statistical receipts of widespread election fraud and irregularities in the 2020 presidential election. He noted this report has never been discredited, despite Democrats and others maintaining that there was no election fraud.\n\n“The central premise of the Jan. 6 committee is that the election was fair. And they simply assert that there was no fraud or irregularities,” Navarro said. “The problem with that is that there is abundant evidence to the contrary, starting with a very extensive and extensively referenced three-volume report I did that explains what that fraud and what those irregularities were, and how and why the Democrats were able to pull off essentially what was a stolen election.”\n\nNavarro also pointed to corporate media turning a blind eye to the Navarro Report and the substantial evidence of fraud in the 2020 presidential election that it details.\n\n“Just as the corporate media ignored purposefully the “In Trump Time” book, which arguably is the best history to date of the Trump White House, they have ignored any reference to the three-volume Navarro Report … The report’s been out there well prior to January 6, and nobody has ever discredited it.”\n\nDefending Against China\n\nThe former official described the Biden administration’s handling of its relationship with the Chinese regime as “total appeasement.”\n\n“I’m very, very concerned that the weakness that Biden showed Putin has resulted in the invasion of Ukraine. The weakness that Biden is showing Xi Jinping may result in an invasion of Taiwan,” he said.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nNavarro, who has authored books including “The Coming China Wars,” “Death By China,” and “Crouching Tiger: What China’s Militarism Means for the World,” is known for his strong defense of the United States against totalitarian China’s aggression, and was one of the chief architects of the Trump administration’s tough trade policies with respect to Beijing. Trump slapped nearly $360 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods during his presidency.\n\nIn the Trump White House, Navarro identified the Chinese Communist Party’s “seven deadly sins” of economic aggression, including cyber hacking to steal trade secrets, intellectual property theft, forced technology transfer, below-cost dumping of products into American markets, the use of heavily subsidized state-owned enterprises that employ predatory pricing, currency manipulation, and the flooding of American communities with fentanyl and other opioids.\n\nWhen asked about what the United States should do now to continue to defend against totalitarian China’s aggression, Navarro stated, “We were ready in a second [Trump administration] term to really up the tariffs.”\n\nHe continued, “I think something that would be a perfect complement to tariffs would be a complete cutting off of capital flows from America to China. It’s crazy that our pension funds, for example, are supporting companies in China that make weapons, for example.

In June 2021, the Biden administration replaced this order with a revised version that in some ways expanded upon the original, including by widening the scope of Chinese companies that could be sanctioned.\n\nNavarro said that “China is an existential threat to the country,” and added, “My view is and has long been that we should stop doing any kind of business with them until they cease their economic aggressions. Geopolitical, revanchist, and imperialist aggression.”\n\nPointing to the need for America to show strength in the face of totalitarian China’s continuing and intensifying aggression, Navarro said, “Strength invites peace, weakness invites war.”', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2021/01/28/CPAC_2019_9A6A5372-1-1200x800.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:57'}

He was suspended for endorsing a Babylon Bee Twitter post that joked that U.S. Assistant Secretary of Health Rachel Levine, also known as Richard Levine—a biological male who is described as transgender—is the site’s “Man of the Year” for 2022.\n\nIn a statement several weeks ago, Twitter claimed that the Babylon Bee post violated the site’s rules, claiming the joke was “hateful content,” according to the satirical website’s founder, Seth Dillon. Carlson’s account also re-posted a comment from Charlie Kirk saying Levine spent “54 years of his life as a man.”\n\nThe move comes after tech entrepreneur Elon Musk and Twitter came to an agreement for Musk to take the company private for $44 billion on Monday.\n\n“A free Twitter would mean a direct challenge to the people in charge of our country’s institutions many of whom are incompetent,” Carlson said on his top-rated Fox News program on Monday evening. “For the first time in years we’ll be able to talk honestly about our leaders. We’ll be able to have the kind of conversations that make democracy possible.”\n\nMusk’s takeover of Twitter triggered questions about whether certain users, including former President Donald Trump, would return to the platform. Trump, however, told news outlets Monday that he plans on staying with his social media site Truth Social and won’t return to Twitter.\n\n“We’re taking in millions of people, and what we’re finding is that the response on Truth is much better than being on Twitter. Twitter has bots and fake accounts, and we are doing everything we can,” Trump said. So far, Trump has only made one post on Truth Social since it was launched in February 2022.\n\nIn mid-April, Trump told Americano News that “Twitter’s become very boring” in recent months because “they’ve gotten rid of a lot of good voices on Twitter … a lot of their conservative voices.”\n\nThe deal was cemented roughly two weeks after the billionaire first revealed a 9 percent stake in the platform. Musk said last week that he had lined up $46.5 billion in financing to buy Twitter, putting pressure on the company’s board to negotiate a deal.\n\nTwitter said the transaction was unanimously approved by its board of directors and is expected to close in 2022, pending regulatory sign-off and the approval of shareholders.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2018/11/09/Tucker-Carlson-debate-1200x800.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:47'}

The constitutional protection of speech does not, on its own, engender a society in which the chance to be heard is truly abundant and free and equitably distributed.\n\n“Freedom for the wolves has often meant death to the sheep,” Mr. Berlin once said. This is a point often lost on Americans. Government — or large centralized authority — is one threat to liberty but not the only one. When it comes to speech, what has often kept a great many people from speaking isn’t censorship but the lack of a platform. Social media, including Twitter, came along and promised to change that. But when it became a cesspit of hate and harassment for women and people of color in particular, it began to offer a miserable bargain: You can be free to say what you wish, but your life can be made unrelentingly painful if you so dare.\n\nThe “censorship” that Mr. Musk performatively deplores consists of efforts to rectify these very real problems of harassment and abuse. Twitter has taken modest but wildly inadequate steps to improve safety on the platform. It has acknowledged it has a problem. It has recognized positive freedom of speech — the creation of a safe and non-life-ruining environment for the airing of thoughts. And it is this that Mr. Musk and his ilk seem to loathe.\n\nThis is why his deal to purchase Twitter is so dangerous. In recent years, there has been progress toward positive freedom of speech — real work to give everyone, truly everyone, more meaningful occasion to speak. Mr. Musk apparently wants to shut that down. Instead, in a moment of proto-fascism on the political right, his priority seems to be to undam the flood of bile and bigotry and bullying and disinformation.\n\nThe country already faces the very real prospect, starting at noon on Jan. 20, 2025, of a descent toward racist authoritarianism and a protracted slide away from liberal democracy. If your idea of what the country needs in this moment is less clamping down on hate and lies and more rightists gone wild, whew.\n\nThe plutocrats have already rigged the economy. That’s just the first step. Then you take some of the spoils and reinvest it in buying even more political influence, so that political inequality can help keep economic inequality yawning. You buy up media or social media platforms and thus can help rig the discourse in your favor, taking control of the tools used by regular people to fight back. You venture, as Mr. Musk did, to a TED conference and, without much pushback, brand yourself as a kind of public intellectual, a thought leader, a visionary, and thereby in many people’s minds you became a sage, not a robber baron.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be this way. We can have nice things. But we’re going to have to learn to see through the fraudulent stories that elevate figures like Mr. Musk into heroes. We’re going to have to legislate real guardrails — perhaps like those created by the European Union’s Digital Services Act — on social media platforms that are too big to entrust democracy to. We’re going to have to build nonprofit alternatives to the platforms and see if they can become meaningful venues.', 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/26/opinion/26giridharadas_2/26giridharadas_2-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:56'}

Co-founder Jack Dorsey (right) holds a board seat, but is expected to give it up in May\n\nMusk is known for using Twitter to post inflammatory messages, much like former President Donald Trump.\n\nParag Agrawal, the CEO, said on Monday that it was up to Musk to decide whether to readmit Trump.\n\nTrump on Monday said he would not be rejoining the site if Musk allowed him to - instead saying he would continue to use his own TRUTH Social.\n\nSome experts are pointing to a tough road ahead for Twitter if Musk, who calls himself a free speech absolutist, gets his way.\n\n'We expect advertisers will be less willing to spend on Twitter if Elon Musk removes content moderation in order to promote free speech,' MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson said.\n\nThe 16-year old company, which has emerged as one of the world's most influential online public squares with about over 200 million users, reported $4.51 billion in ad revenue for 2021, accounting for about 89% of its overall sales.\n\n'The challenge (for Twitter) will be maintaining and building revenue given that the controversial opinions (Musk) hopes to give more of a free rein to are often unpalatable to advertisers,' Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Susannah Streeter said.\n\nTesla tycoon versus Big Tech: How swashbuckling billionaire Elon Musk fought off 'poison pill', lawsuits and hostile board of directors before $44bn Twitter takeover\n\nIt has been one of the most dramatic takeover attempts in history, seeing a swashbuckling billionaire pitted against one of the largest tech giants in the world.\n\nBut Elon Musk's seizing of Twitter has been a months-long pursuit that has seen him send shockwaves through the world of business.\n\nThe Tesla magnate started hoarding shares in the social media firm at the start of the year in an apparent bid to preserve free speech online.\n\nHe quickly rocketed to the top of its shareholders' list, acquiring a huge 9% stake in the tech giant.\n\nBut then he hit choppy waters, accepting a place on the board then rejecting it, getting embroiled in lawsuits and seeing rival companies circle to buy Twitter.\n\nMeanwhile bosses at the social media firm appeared to do all they could to ensure he could not not seize it - even launching a 'poison pill' strategy to sink his chances.\n\nYet Musk brazenly blasted through all the obstacles, punting a $43 billion offer earlier this month and showing how he would finance it.\n\nThe two sides were reportedly working into the early morning on Monday to finalize the 'fast-moving' negotiations.\n\nIt saw Twitter shares in the US soar by four percent as the markets opened to $50.84 a share.\n\nOn Monday, Musk called for his 'worst critics' to remain on the platform because 'that is what free speech means'.\n\nHere, DailyMail.com looks at the rollercoaster journey he has been on over the last few months as he seizes his prize.\n\n\n\nThe Tesla magnate started hoarding shares in the social media firm at the start of the year in an apparent bid to preserve free speech online\n\nJanuary 31: Musk hoards Twitter shares and buys them 'almost daily'\n\nMusk started buying Twitter stock on January 31 and continued to buy shares during every trading session through April 1, according to an SEC filing.\n\nJust days earlier, he told his 80 million followers on the site he was ' giving serious thought ' to creating his own social media platform.\n\nA user asked him: 'Would you consider building a new social media platform, @elonmusk?\n\n'One that would consist an open source algorithm, one where free speech and adhering to free speech is given top priority, one where propaganda is very minimal. I think that kind of a platform is needed.'\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO replied through his official account: 'Am giving serious thought to this.'\n\nThe billionaire businessman, 50, appeared to be suggesting he was sick of Twitter over the right to freedom of speech.\n\nApril 4: Musk says he bought 9.2 percent stake in firm a month earlier\n\nMusk revealed he had purchased a 9.2 percent stake in the social media giant on March 14.\n\nHe tweeted 'oh hi lol' after the news sent shockwaves through the business world and across social media. He added: 'Do you want an edit button?'\n\nApril 5: He joins Twitter's board of directors - sees share price rocket\n\nTwitter said the tech tycoon was joining the company's board of directors, causing the social media platform's shares to rise over 7 per cent in premarket trading.\n\nIt led to speculation he would try to address what he called the platform's 'failure to adhere to free speech principles' and 'fundamentally undermine democracy'.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Musk would have served on the board until the company's 2024 annual shareholders meeting.\n\nAs long as he remains a director, the agreement said, he could not won more than 14.9 percent of the company's stock.\n\nIt meant he would not have been able to take over the company until well after his term on the board was over.\n\nThe firm said: 'Twitter is committed to impartiality in the development and enforcement of its policies and rules.\n\n'Our policy decisions are not determined by the Board or shareholders, and we have no plans to reverse any policy decisions.'\n\n'As always our Board plays an important advisory and feedback role across the entirety of our service.\n\n'Our day to day operations and decisions are made by Twitter management and employees.'\n\nApril 8: Asset managers take over Musk as largest shareholders\n\nAsset manager Vanguard Group increased its stake to overtake Musk as the largest shareholder.\n\nVanguard owned 10.3 percent of Twitter, while the Tesla tycoon owned 9.1 per cent, making him the largest individual shareholder.\n\nVanguard, led by CEO Tim Buckley, increased its stake in the company at some point during the first quarter, according to SEC filings made on April 8.\n\nIt previously reported owning 67.2million shares of Twitter or about 8.4 per cent of the company as of the end of December, according to FactSet.\n\nOther owners of large quantities of Twitter stock included Morgan Stanley, Fidelity and Black Rock.\n\nVanguard, led by CEO Tim Buckley, increased its stake in the company at some point during the first quarter, according to SEC filings made on April 8\n\nApril 9: Musk rejects the offer to join Twitter's board of directors\n\nMusk rejected an offer to join Twitter's board after disclosing his stake in the company.\n\nAnalysts said the move signaled his intention to take over the company as a board seat would have limited his stake to just under 15 per cent.\n\nParag Agrawal said the board would still 'remain open' to Musk's input, but warned: 'There will be distractions ahead but our goals and priorities remain unchanged.'\n\nHe said: 'The board and I had many discussions about Elon joining the board, and with Elon directly. We were excited to collaborate and clear about the risks.\n\n'We also believed that having Elon as a fiduciary of the company where he, like all board members, has to act in the best interests of the company and all our shareholders, was the best path forward. The board offered him a seat.'\n\nAgrawal continued: 'We announced on Tuesday that Elon would be appointed to the board contingent on a background check and formal acceptance.\n\n'Elon's appointment to the board was to become officially effective 4/9, but Elon shared that same morning that he will no longer be joining the board.'\n\nParag Agrawal said the board would still 'remain open' to Musk's input, but warned: 'There will be distractions ahead but our goals and priorities remain unchanged'\n\nApril 12: Twitter shareholder Marc Bain Rasella files suit against Musk\n\nMarc Bain Rasella filed a lawsuit against Musk for alleged securities fraud at a Manhattan federal court, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nThe suit claimed the billionaire was required to disclose his holdings to the SEC by March 24, but the delay kept Twitter's share price down allowing Musk to buy more.\n\nMusk was accused of violating a regulatory deadline to reveal he had accumulated a stake of at least five per cent.\n\nInstead, according to the complaint, Musk did not disclose his position in Twitter until he had almost doubled his stake to more than nine per cent.\n\nThat strategy, the lawsuit alleges, hurt less wealthy investors who sold shares in the company in the nearly two weeks before Musk acknowledged holding a major stake.\n\nApril 14: The Tesla tycoon offers to buy Twitter for $43 BILLION\n\nMusk offered to buy Twitter for $43billion, a regulatory filing showed, as he moved to seize the social media giant.\n\nMusk's offer price of $54.20 per share represented a 38 per cent premium to the closing price of Twitter's stock on April 1.\n\nThis was the last trading day before the Tesla CEO's over nine per cent investment in the company was publicly announced.\n\nIt even appeared to reference marijuana - also known as 420 - a common reference used by Musk on Twitter.\n\nTwitter said in a regulatory filing Musk provided a letter containing a proposal to buy the remaining shares of Twitter he did not already own.\n\nApril 15: Twitter launches 'poison pill' strategy to stop Musk buyout\n\nTwitter's board announced a dramatic poison pill plan to prevent Musk from increasing his stake in the company.\n\nAlso known as a shareholder rights provision, the plan would trigger a dilution of shares if any shareholder builds up a 15 per cent stake without the board's approval.\n\nThe plan did not prevent Twitter from accepting Musk's offer or entering negotiations with him or other potential buyers.\n\nBut it did stop the billionaire from putting pressure on the board by buying up ever more shares on the open market.\n\nMusk hit back with a laughing emoji to a version of the classic 'Distracted Boyfriend' meme mocking Twitter's board.\n\nThe imaged depicted 'Twitter's board' looking wistfully at the option to 'keep that easy gig that gives me shares' as 'Twitter investors' look on with disgust.\n\nTwitter's board is led by chairman Bret Taylor, who is also the co-CEO of business software giant Salesforce\n\nApril 16: Musk tweets Love Me Tender in tease of hostile takeover\n\nMusk tweeted 'Love Me Tender' as he again teased at the possibility of a hostile takeover of Twitter.\n\nThe billionaire posted the Elvis Presley lyrics in a potential bid to lure shareholders with a tender offer that could see him seize control.\n\nA tender offer would see him bypass the board and go to shareholders with his offer of $54.20 a share - but he would need to show how he would finance his bid.\n\nHe also appeared to suggest he would strip board members of their salaries, saying they would get '$0 if my bid succeeds'.\n\nApril 18: Jack Dorsey slams the Twitter board for 'plots and coups'\n\nJack Dorsey slammed the board of Twitter as he weighed into the toxic fight over Elon Musk's attempted hostile takeover for the first time.\n\nThe former CEO, who is still a member of the board himself, blasted the 'plots and coups' that were 'consistently the dysfunction of the company'.\n\nIn a series of bombshell tweets and replies, he endorsed one posting saying that 'a bad board will kill a company every time'.\n\nReplying to one post, he said: 'When I was fired in 2008 and made chair, the board took most of my shares away from me.\n\n'I also gave 1 per cent of the company back to the employee pool in 2015. So, ended up with very little of company.'\n\nHe also replied to one comment mentioning 'plots and coups' in the Twitter board saying: 'it's consistently been the dysfunction of the company'.\n\nEarlier in the thread, he replied to a post quoting a 'Silicon Valley proverb' by venture capitalist Fred Destin.\n\nIt said: 'Good boards don't create good companies, but a bad board will kill a company every time.' Dorsey said: 'Big facts.'\n\nFormer CEO Dorsey slammed Twitter's board of directors on as he replied to a series of unfriendly tweets\n\nApril 21: SpaceX boss unveils his $46.5billion financing package\n\nElon Musk unveiled his $46.5billion financing package to fund his takeover of Twitter - using Tesla as collateral.\n\nThe world's richest man filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission outlining how he would seize the social media giant.\n\nHe committed $21billion in equity, $13billion from Morgan Stanley in debt facilities and another $12.5billion from the bank and others in margin loans.\n\nBut 'a portion' of his shares in Tesla have been put forward as collateral, which analysts feared could have a huge impact on the firm.\n\nThe 50-year-old billionaire also revealed he was weighing up launching a tender offer for Twitter after the company ignored his acquisition offer.\n\nHe said he was exploring getting stocks directly from shareholders but admitted he 'has not determined whether to do so at this time'.\n\nMusk filed the document with the SEC showing how he planned to take over Twitter for about $46.5billion.\n\nHe secured a debt commitment letter from Morgan Stanley Senior Funding to the tune of $13billion in financing.\n\nThis was made up of a loan of $6.5billion, a senior secured revolving facility for $500million, a bridge loan of up to $3billion and an unsecured bridge loan for up to $3billion.\n\nHe also got a margin loan commitment letter from Morgan Stanley for $12.5 billion in margin loans. And Musk also got $21billion through equity financing.\n\nBut he has used 'a portion' of his shares in Tesla as collateral in the high-stakes move, which analysts warned could have huge ramifications for the company.\n\nApril 22: Musk posts 'boner' killer picture of Bill Gates on Twitter\n\nMusk dissed Bill Gates' gut on Twitter, posting a photo of the Microsoft mogul next to Apple's controversial pregnant man emoji 'in case you need to lose a boner.'\n\nHe posted a follow-up image in response to the Friday post of six hooded figured captioned 'shadow ban council reviewing Tweet'.\n\nThe joke could further infuriate woke Twitter staffers angered by Musk's ongoing bid to buy the firm after saying he would support free speech.\n\nThat is because the pregnant man emoji is aimed at being inclusive to transgender people - with Musk frequently taking aim at what he sees as woke overreach.\n\nApril 25: Musk finalizes deal to buy Twitter\n\nMusk was closing in on seizing Twitter as talks between the Tesla magnate and the tech giant entered their final stages, reports say.\n\nThe tycoon's representatives were said to be hammering out terms including a timeline and fees if an agreement was signed and then fell apart.\n\nThe two sides were reportedly working into the early morning to finalize the 'fluid and fast-moving' negotiations.\n\nTwitter shares soared by four percent as the markets opened to $50.84 a share amid reports it would be seized by Musk.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Twitter announced it had 'entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by an entity wholly owned by Elon Musk, for $54.20 per share in cash in a transaction valued at approximately $44 billion. Upon completion of the transaction, Twitter will become a privately held company.'", 'image': 'https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/26/14/57069119-0-image-a-49_1650980561815.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:46'}

After months in short supply, federal officials say the medications are now more widely available, yet are being underused.\n\nAs part of the new effort, the federal government plans to allow thousands of more pharmacies to directly order highly effective COVID-19 treatments like Pfizer\'s Paxlovid antiviral pills, which can reduce the risk of becoming severely ill. They also plan to launch additional "test-to-treat" sites, where Americans can get diagnosed and receive the pills in a single visit.\n\nPaxlovid was first authorized by the Food and Drug Administration in December, and supplies were hard to come by at first. Now the pills are no longer scarce, but they still aren\'t getting to everyone who might benefit from treatment.\n\n"It\'s pretty clear from the uptake of Paxlovid, and the rate of hospitalizations and deaths over the months that Paxlovid has been available, that there are still some folks who could have benefited from these medications," an administration official told reporters on Monday in a briefing to preview the announcement.\n\nFederal officials have voiced concerns publicly for weeks that treatments like Paxlovid, Merck and Ridgeback\'s Lagevrio antiviral pills, and Eli Lilly\'s bebtelovimab monoclonal antibody drug were not reaching enough Americans.\n\nOfficials said Monday that reported use of the antiviral pills has more than doubled over the past month, from 22,000 courses a week to over 55,000. That comes as cases and hospitalizations have begun to climb nationwide, driven by the highly-contagious Omicron BA.2 subvariant.\n\nIn New England, federal data has tracked the pace of new COVID-19 hospitalizations surging among patients 70 and older — the age group most vulnerable to severe COVID-19 — since the beginning of April. The rate of new admissions is now higher than the peak reached over the Delta variant wave last year, but remains a fraction of the record highs during the winter Omicron wave.\n\n"We certainly know that there\'s more room to go. We can save more lives by giving this medication to more people," said the official.\n\nGetting Paxlovid antiviral pills\n\nPaxlovid treatment needs to begin within a few days of first developing symptoms.\n\nA course of treatment is made up of three tablets that are taken twice a day, in the morning and evening, over the course of five days, for a total of 30 pills. Initial clinical trials showed the drug reduced the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization or death by 88%, compared to placebo.\n\nPaxlovid cannot be taken at the same time as several medications that can reduce the drug\'s efficacy or lead to potentially fatal side effects.\n\nThrough outreach to doctors and patients, officials say they hope more eligible Americans will act quickly to get the now-plentiful antiviral pills sitting on pharmacy shelves.\n\nPfizer\'s COVID-19 drug Paxlovid Fabian Sommer/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\n"A lot of providers early on in that scarcity mindset, when there were fewer courses available across the country, were really reserving this for only the folks who they thought would be the sickest of the sick," an administration official told reporters.\n\nOn Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health alert urging doctors to step up prescribing of effective COVID-19 treatments — and imploring at-risk patients who test positive not to delay in contacting their doctors, "even if your symptoms are mild."\n\nA "tranche" of more than 100,000 courses of the antiviral pills will be made available to all of the federal government\'s pharmacy partners to order directly, instead of through federal and local allocations. Officials say they expect the move will raise the number of sites with drugs in stock from 20,000 to 30,000.\n\nThat comes on top of efforts like the administration\'s nationwide "test-to-treat initiative" launched at thousands of pharmacies earlier this year.\n\nFollowing concerns that the program was inaccessible to Americans living in many parts of the country, officials said the administration is planning to launch new "federally-supported Test-to-Treat sites" beyond the 2,200 locations currently in the program.\n\n"I think we\'re going to be working really closely with these new federally supported sites, work directly with state, territorial, and jurisdictional leadership to identify the places that need more support," said an administration official.\n\nChallenges and questions\n\nOfficials acknowledged that the new moves do not address some of the criticisms levied against the Biden administration\'s treatment effort.\n\nDespite objections from pharmacy trade groups, the FDA excludes most pharmacists from being able to prescribe Paxlovid or Lagevrio. For at-risk Americans without access to a "test-to-treat" drugstore that has a qualifying provider available, this means some will have to make multiple trips to get the pills.\n\n"You have to develop COVID symptoms, you have to subsequently get a test for COVID-19, get the result of that test, find and go to see a provider, get a prescription, and then fill that prescription. That\'s six steps in five days," said an official.\n\nIt also does not include an expansion to who is eligible to take the drugs under the FDA\'s emergency use authorization.\n\nSpeaking at Uniformed Services University earlier this month, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the president\'s chief medical adviser, hinted that Paxlovid might soon be expanded to lower-risk patients "in order to prevent them possibly from getting long COVID."\n\nBoth Pfizer and Merck have also been running a range of trials that might support expanding use of the antiviral pills to more people. Results could come soon from a trial assessing Paxlovid in people who are exposed to the disease, but have not yet developed symptoms, which was due to be completed earlier this month.\n\nAnd administration officials at the briefing did not bring up growing reports of "rebound" or "relapse" symptoms — people who appear to recover from COVID-19 after taking the antiviral pills, but later get a new round of symptoms — which might lead to SARS-CoV-2 evolving resistance to the treatments.\n\nA spokesperson for Pfizer said the company was continuing to monitor data from their clinical trials of Paxlovid as well as real-world evidence, and has "not seen any resistance" to the drug.\n\nIn a statement, an FDA spokesperson acknowledged that reports of rebound "are important to evaluate further," but reiterated that the drug appeared 88% effective at reducing the risk of hospitalization or death in its clinical trial.\n\n"The FDA is evaluating the reports of viral load rebound after completing Paxlovid treatment and will share recommendations if appropriate," said the FDA\'s Chanapa Tantibanchachai.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/04/26/75834f94-0c35-4873-8166-5e4b24cfa0d3/thumbnail/1200x630/5625e6265f72e4689718b2845b0511c4/gettyimages-1238865166.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:22'}

Supply of the regimen was initially very limited, but as Covid-19 cases across the country have fallen and manufacturing has increased, it is now far more abundant. The White House is now moving to raise awareness of the pill and its availability, as well as making it easier to access.\n\nThe White House said Tuesday it is increasingly reaching out to doctors and announced that the drug will now be shipped directly to pharmacies, in addition to existing distribution channels run by states. That is expected to increase the number of sites from 20,000 to more than 30,000 next week and eventually to 40,000 locations.\n\nHowever, according to a senior Biden administration official speaking anonymously to Axios, many states are ordering just two-thirds of what is available to them and are using half their orders.\n\nProviders are probably limiting access to the pill because “we’ve had the experience in this pandemic before of operating in a scarcity mindset,” another administration official said in a press conference.\n\nMany states have opted for a lottery system to allocate Paxlovid and other Covid-19 drugs, often choosing to distribute the drugs to retail pharmacies instead of hospitals and clinics.\n\nAccording to Dr Douglas White, a University of Pittsburgh critical care doctor who helped design Pennsylvania’s lottery system for Covid-19 drug allocation, the system ends up favoring people who are not only aware of the drugs but have access to doctors to prescribe it and the ability to locate pharmacies that have them in stock.\n\n“The wealthy and well-connected will win the race,” White told the Los Angeles Times. It’s “the poster child for an unfair system.”\n\nDespite the administration’s attempt to reassure providers that there are enough pills for patients, in an interview with NPR on Monday, the White House’s Covid-19 response coordinator, Dr Ashish Jha, said that there are only enough pills “for the short run.” As of Tuesday, the US had ordered enough supply of the pills for 20 million people, which is estimated to last for several more months.\n\n“Right now, we’ve done a really good job of acquiring pills,” Jha said, adding that the Biden administration will need additional funding from Congress to acquire more pills. “We have to make sure that this is more than a short-term solution.”\n\nJha warned that the US will be running out of money for Paxlovid “reasonably soon,” and that “we actually aren’t even going to be able to pay our bills for what we’ve already entered into a contract with Pfizer for, so that’s going to be a problem.”\n\nThe Biden administration is expected to renew its request to Congress for $22bn in Covid-19 funding.\n\nPaxlovid, when administered within five days of symptoms appearing, has been proven to bring about a 90% reduction in hospitalizations and deaths among patients most likely to get severe disease. About 350 Americans are now dying each day from Covid-19, down from more than 2,600 during the height of the Omicron wave earlier this year.\n\nThe FDA authorized Pfizer’s drug for emergency use in adults and children age 12 or older with a positive Covid-19 test and early symptoms who face the highest risk of severe outcomes. That includes older people and those with conditions like obesity and heart disease, though the drug is not recommended for patients with severe kidney or liver problems.\n\nThe administration is also working to expand the number of “test-to-treat” sites that provide a one-stop shop for those with Covid-19 to get tested for the virus, consult with a medical professional if they’re positive and fill a prescription for Paxlovid on site.\n\nThere are now 2,200 such locations nationwide, though the administration hopes more sites come online in the next several weeks with support from the Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and pharmacy companies.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ec9f8e72eff2d14c7cbb28bd8af41604fea72e5/0_301_5075_3047/master/5075.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=269eeb032fb24072e4c2185b17d3cc66', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:54'}

It will introduce a series of obligations for large social-media networks like Twitter, ranging from new standards for taking down illegal content to a requirement to conduct annual risk assessments detailing how they are responding to harmful content that is posted online.\n\nTwitter will become a private company if Elon Musk’s $44 billion takeover bid is approved. The move would allow Musk to make changes to the site. WSJ’s Dan Gallagher explains Musk’s proposed changes and the challenges he might face enacting them. Illustration: Jordan Kranse\n\nThe text of the new law still needs formal approval from the EU Parliament and representatives from EU countries, but it is unlikely to change substantially from what lawmakers agreed to last week.\n\nMr. Breton expressed confidence in a post on Twitter earlier Tuesday that the company under Mr. Musk’s ownership would conform to the EU’s new rules.\n\n“Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules—regardless of their shareholding,” Mr. Breton wrote. “Mr Musk knows this well. He is familiar with European rules on automotive, and will quickly adapt to the Digital Services Act.”\n\nMr. Musk’s purchase of Twitter could mark an eventual test case for the EU’s new legislation once it comes into effect, said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond. While there are questions about whether the European Commission will have the resources to fully enforce the new law, Prof. Tobias said, “I do think [Mr. Musk] is on notice, and Twitter shareholders, too.”\n\nMr. Musk wrote on Twitter Tuesday afternoon that his view of free speech is speech that “matches the law.”\n\n“I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law,” he said. “If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect.”\n\nMr. Breton said the EU was careful in setting its regulations to maintain freedom of speech. He said he had interactions with many platforms during the lawmaking process and was open to meeting with others, in a comment that appeared to be aimed at Mr. Musk. “If any new shareholder of these platforms is willing to engage with me, my door will be totally open, like always,” he said.\n\nThe EU’s new legislation won’t prevent Mr. Musk from taking a more free-speech-oriented approach, said Zach Meyers, a senior research fellow with the Centre for European Reform think tank. However, he said Twitter will still need to comply with rules on the removal of illegal content, which would likely require hiring more people to deal with content moderation and complaints.\n\nElon Musk and Twitter More coverage of the billionaire's bid for Twitter, selected by editors Latest Developments\n\nWrite to Kim Mackrael at kim.mackrael@wsj.com", 'image': 'https://images.wsj.net/im-531712/social', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:24'}

In the wake of this "great deplatforming," Republicans\' longstanding gripes with these platforms became a legislative priority.\n\nOne of the most aggressive of these Republican-led efforts to regulate social media is Texas\' H.B. 20. Ostensibly passed to combat the "dangerous movement by social media companies to silence conservative viewpoints and ideas," this bill prohibits social media platforms from removing users or content "based on the viewpoint" of the user or content. In its effort to protect conservative speech, Texas Republicans have adopted a historically discredited left-wing legal theory, dispensing with core conservative values in the process.\n\nIn the 1960s, a group of progressive scholars argued that the First Amendment does not merely prohibit the government from censoring private speech and press. In fact, they argued, it granted the government the affirmative power to control the mass media. In a capitalist system, they reasoned, the government must ensure that private media owners do not exclude unwelcome viewpoints, in order to protect the "democratic interest" in free speech. To this end, the scholars championed the Fairness Doctrine, right-of-reply mandates, and expansive applications of "common carriage" doctrine, which enable the government to force the inclusion of certain content.\n\nBorrowing from the same playbook, Texas now argues that First Amendment values require, rather than prohibit, government interference with private speech. H.B. 20 declares that social media platforms are common carriers like telephone companies and thus are subject to onerous restrictions over who and what they may host. According to Texas, H.B. 20 serves the democratic interest in protecting the free exchange of ideas and information. But like the collectivist efforts that preceded it, Texas\' misguided attempt to advance "First Amendment rights in the Lone Star State" violates private platforms\' First Amendment rights to choose what speech they publish.\n\nAs we explained in a recently filed amicus curiae brief on behalf of the Cato Institute, courts have repeatedly rejected such regulations, and for good reasons.\n\nFirst, as a federal district court correctly noted last year, the First Amendment protects social media platforms\' discretion to publish or remove content. The Supreme Court established this right in the 1974 case Miami Herald Publishing Company v. Tornillo, when it struck down a Florida law that forced newspapers to print responses to their criticism of political candidates. The Court explained that this "right-of-reply" law infringed on newspapers\' right to choose what content they publish.\n\nThe Supreme Court affirmed that First Amendment rights apply with full force to internet media in 1997\'s Reno v. ACLU. Other federal courts have since upheld the editorial rights of search engines and social media sites. These precedents doom the Texas law. The state can\'t eviscerate platforms\' well-established First Amendment rights by arbitrarily calling them common carriers.\n\nSecond, efforts like H.B. 20 chill, rather than encourage, the exercise of free speech. Both the Florida right-of-reply law and the Fairness Doctrine actually discouraged the media from covering controversial topics that would trigger the forced-hosting requirements. Likewise, H.B. 20 will encourage platforms to ban entire subjects (say, discussions of terrorism) to avoid facing the unappetizing choice to either host objectionable viewpoints (such as pro-terrorism material) or face liability for removing each piece of content.\n\nThird, H.B. 20 violates fundamental property rights by forcing private platforms to host users and content they would otherwise exclude. The First Amendment does not authorize the government to co-opt private property to amplify certain viewpoints.\n\nThe supporters of the Texas law, like other conservative opponents of Big Tech, cite anecdotal accounts of inconsistent content moderation to support their claim of unfair bias. But it\'s more likely that these incidents are just casualties of the margin of error inherent in content moderation at scale. "Incorrect" removals of content happen millions of times per day to users representing every conceivable ideology. Conservatives are removed from platforms when they violate platforms\' terms of service, but Texas\' premise that conservatives are being unfairly targeted is unsubstantiated.\n\nBut even if it was substantiated, forced-hosting laws like H.B. 20 would contravene limited government, constitutional fidelity, and strong property rights, all of which are supposed to be core conservative values. If Texas Republicans really want to protect "conservative viewpoints," they should reacquaint themselves with those principles and reject giving the government more control over social media.', 'image': 'https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2022/04/timothy-hales-bennett-OwvRB-M3GwE-unsplash-scaled.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:31'}

It is a reminder why we need a wealth tax and why we need some serious regulation for Big Tech. One billionaire should not be able to turn the world upside down just because he plays by a different set of rules,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who believes the government should break up Big Tech companies to promote more competition.\n\nAsked whether Musk’s acquisition of Twitter was cause for concern, Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said: “Absolutely it does.”\n\n“He said he wants to make it this global message board. My first question to him, ‘Is your message board going to include Donald Trump?’ ” he said. “That’s a key question. If he lets that man rant and rave on Twitter, not in the best interests of America’s’ future.”\n\nDurbin, who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee, noted that his and other panels are exploring whether it would be appropriate to impose new regulations on Big Tech companies to incentivize them to do more to moderate content.\n\nSpeaking at Stanford last week, Obama said tech firms “need to be more transparent about how they operate” and crack down on “lies and conspiracy theories” that threaten the nation’s democratic system.\n\n“Without some standards, implications of this technology — for our elections, for our legal system, for our democracy, for rules of evidence, for our entire social order — are frightening and profound,” he warned.\n\nMusk hasn’t said whether he’ll let Trump, who was permanently barred from Twitter in January 2021, back on the platform, but his recent comments have fueled speculation that he might do so. Trump has indicated he’s not interested in getting back on Twitter, though he is known for changing his mind.\n\nSen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he also had concerns about what Musk’s purchase of Twitter might mean for the platform’s content standards.\n\nHe said he was looking into the matter but declined to provide any detail.\n\n“I’ve got some concerns. I think it will have to go through … some level of appropriate regulatory [review], and I’m doing some of my own checking,” he said.\n\nSen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) said Musk’s control over a major forum for political debate is alarming.\n\n“It’s always a concern when an oligarch may be owning the town square. I think we do need to pay a lot of attention to how it’s managed,” he said.\n\nMusk’s takeover of Twitter raises questions about what it means for his settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over fraud charges stemming from his August 2018 tweet that he had secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 per share, which pushed the car company’s stock higher.\n\nUnder the settlement, Musk must allow a Tesla lawyer to review any tweets containing material business information before hitting the send button.\n\nSen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), the chairwoman of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, said allowing Trump back on Twitter would be a major problem.\n\n“I think that’s very problematic,” she said of Trump’s possible return. “I don’t think that somebody who encouraged and organized a violent insurrection to take over our government should be allowed on Twitter.”\n\nAsked about the loosening of content standards, she said she “would certainly have concerns” but added she hadn’t looked at the deal closely enough to “get into a big analysis.”\n\nTrump, who has launched a social media venture that includes a platform intended to vie with Twitter, told Fox News on Monday that he doesn’t plan to return to Twitter.\n\n“I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,” he said, referring to his Truth Social messaging platform, before the deal was announced. “I hope Elon buys Twitter because he’ll make improvements to it and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth. The bottom line is, no, I am not going back to Twitter.”\n\nTwitter permanently suspended Trump because of what it called “the risk of further incitement of violence” after a mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to halt the certification of President Biden’s victory.\n\nTwitter later unveiled a civic integrity policy that prohibited the use of its services for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes. It also reserved the right to flag or reduce the visibility of tweets containing false or misleading information about civic processes.\n\nAt a TED conference this month, Musk stressed the importance of allowing free speech on Twitter.\n\n“Twitter has become kind of the de facto town square, so it’s just really important that people have both the reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely within the bounds of the law,” he said.\n\nConservatives on Monday applauded Musk’s move.\n\n“Elon Musk did his part for free speech today. Let’s hope the Supreme Court does as well,” former Rep. Mark Walker (N.C.), a conservative Republican running for Senate, tweeted Monday afternoon.\n\nDemocrats are worried what that means for policing claims that Biden stole the 2020 presidential election or misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n“I’m a big free speech guy, but this stuff isn’t working. It’s terrorizing democracy, and from that perspective I think it’s bad for Democrats in this sense: These Republican alt groups tend to dominate. They tend to have much more of a footprint on these social media platforms than Democrats do,” said Steve Jarding, a Democratic strategist and former senior adviser to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\nJarding is also the communications director for a new social media platform called Pixstory, which has a business model designed to root out hate and misinformation by giving integrity scores to people who post on the site.\n\nBut Jarding called it “a horrible problem” that the world’s richest person is taking over a major means of political discourse at a time when Democrats are discussing proposals to tax the unrealized capital gains of multibillionaires such as Musk to pay for proposals to fight climate change and economic inequality.\n\n“He could turn it into anything that he wants. He controls literally hundreds of millions of hits, if you will, or clicks on a platform that he can determine whether it’s used in a good way or a bad way, and that’s too much concentration with one individual,” Jarding added.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/stabenowdebbie_020922arl.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:10'}

As YouTube celebrates its 17th birthday, the game-changing user-generated video platform once known for funny pet videos and other benign content continues to attract criticism for its alleged role in fostering extremism. Ample evidence casts doubt on the idea that social media platforms are radicalizing American youth, but high-profile anecdotes about bad turns allegedly inspired by YouTube, Facebook, and other sites make it hard to combat such claims. Now one such story may come before the Supreme Court—and threaten a foundational internet speech law.\n\nThe case (Gonzalez v. Google LLC) involves a man whose daughter was killed in a 2015 ISIS attack in Paris. The grieving father, Reynaldo Gonzalez, sued YouTube\'s parent company, Google, under the U.S. Anti-Terrorism Act. Gonzalez claims that ISIS posted recruitment videos on YouTube, that YouTube recommended these videos to users, and that this led to his daughter\'s death.\n\nGonzalez\'s circumstances are tragic, but his claim is convoluted and patently illogical. To buy it, you have to buy the idea that without YouTube, the terrorist group not only would be unable to recruit members but would cease to use existing networks to carry out attacks.\n\nThe Supreme Court has not yet decided whether it will hear Gonzalez\'s case. But if it does, it could give the Court a chance to consider the parameters of Section 230, the federal law preventing internet companies and users from being liable for all third-party speech (and pretty much the backbone of the internet as we know it).\n\nSCOTUSblog notes that in 2020, Justice Clarence Thomas suggested that "in an appropriate case, we should consider whether the text of this increasingly important statute aligns with the current state of immunity enjoyed by Internet platforms." (Thomas made a similar suggestion earlier this year.)\n\n"The petition in Gonzalez v. Google LLC tries to present itself as the case Thomas has been looking for," writes Andrew Hamm:\n\nThe district court dismissed Gonzalez\'s claim on the ground that Section 230 nonetheless protected Google for its recommendations because ISIS produced the videos, not Google. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit affirmed, concluding that Section 230 protects such recommendations, at least if the provider\'s algorithm treated content on its website similarly. However, the panel in Gonzalez considered itself bound to reach this result because of a recent case on the same issue that another 9th Circuit panel decided while Gonzalez was pending. The Gonzalez panel further concluded that, if it could resolve the question itself, Section 230 would not protect a provider\'s content recommendations. Gonzalez admits that the circuits to face this question are not split. Instead, Gonzalez suggests that, had his case simply come out before the other 9th Circuit decision, then Google would be the one seeking review. Regardless, he maintains, the providers\' financial dependence on advertisements and hence on algorithms that can target users makes this question of recommendations important to resolve.\n\nGonzalez is far from the first person to sue social media companies over terrorist acts. But these people "have yet to talk a court into agreeing with their arguments," as Tim Cushing noted at Techdirt last fall.\n\n"The facts in these cases are invariably awful: often people have been brutally killed and their loved ones are seeking redress for their loss. There is a natural, and perfectly reasonable, temptation to give them some sort of remedy from someone, but as we argued in our brief, that someone cannot be an internet platform," wrote constitutional lawyer Cathy Gellis in 2017:\n\nThere are several reasons for this, including some that have nothing to do with Section 230. For instance, even if Section 230 did not exist and platforms could be liable for the harms resulting from their users\' use of their services, for them to be liable there would have to be a clear connection between the use of the platform and the harm.\n\nSection 230 "should prevent a court from ever even reaching the tort law analysis," added Gellis. "With Section 230, a platform should never find itself having to defend against liability for harm that may have resulted from how people used it."\n\nA new study backs up what advocates for Section 230 have been saying for a long time: The law protects small companies and creators more than big tech giants.\n\n"If you understand the mechanisms by which Section 230 actually works, the key is that it gets frivolous and wasteful lawsuits kicked out of court much earlier—when the costs are still intense, but more bearable," points out Mike Masnick in a Techdirt post about the study. "Without Section 230, the end result of the court case may be the same—where the company wins—but the costs would be much, much higher. For Facebook and Google that\'s not going to make a huge difference. But for smaller companies, it can be the difference between life and death."\n\n"Larger enterprises are less impacted by lawsuits," point out the authors of the study, in a report titled "Understanding Section 230 & the Impact of Litigation on Small Providers." A large company "may already have: 1) lawyers ready to deal with lawsuits (allowing the business to continue with minimal disruption); 2) insurance coverage that can offset the cost of a defense, a settlement, or a damage award; and 3) sufficient revenue and cash reserves such that most cases are viewed as a cost of doing business rather than a cataclysmic event."\n\nSmall companies are less likely to have or be able to afford any of these things, making it less likely that they will fight even lawsuits that they would win.\n\nPoliticians, alas, have taken to scapegoating Section 230 for basically anything they or their constituents don\'t like about the internet. And lawyers keep getting creative in their anti–Section 230 arguments, suggesting that while Section 230 may broadly protect internet platforms from liability for many things that users post, the law does not covers various facets of these platforms—their design, their algorithms, etc..\n\nOccasionally, judges appear sympathetic to this. In Taamneh v. Twitter, which the 9th Circuit ruled on last year, Judge Marsha Berzon wrote that Section 230 protects "only traditional activities of publication and distribution—such as deciding whether to publish, withdraw, or alter content—and does not include activities that promote or recommend content or connect content users to each other. I urge this Court to reconsider our precedent en banc to the extent that it holds that section 230 extends to the use of machine-learning algorithms to recommend content and connections to users."\n\n"This is a really weird, really dangerous place to start drawing the line in Section 230 lawsuits," wrote Tim Cushing last summer. "Algorithms react to input from users. If YouTube can\'t be held directly responsible for videos uploaded by users, it makes sense it would be immunized against algorithmically suggesting content based on users\' actions and preferences. The algorithm does next to nothing on its own without input from content viewers. It takes a user to really get it moving."\n\nFREE MINDS\n\nA federal appeals court has rejected a university\'s ban on "discriminatory harassment." The University of Central Florida\'s "discriminatory harassment" ban likely violates the First Amendment, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals said. The case is Speech First, Inc. v. Cartwright, and you can read the whole ruling here. In essence, the court found the school\'s policy against allegedly discriminatory speech to be too broad:\n\n[T]he policy (1) prohibits a wide range of "verbal, physical, electronic, and other" expression concerning any of (depending on how you count) some 25 or so characteristics; (2) states that prohibited speech "may take many forms, including verbal acts, name-calling, graphic or written statements" and even "other conduct that may be humiliating"; (3) employs a gestaltish "totality of known circumstances" approach to determine whether particular speech, for instance, "unreasonably alters" another student\'s educational experience; and (4) reaches not only a student\'s own speech, but also her conduct "encouraging," "condoning," or "failing to intervene" to stop another student\'s speech. The policy, in short, is staggeringly broad, and any number of statements—some of which are undoubtedly protected by the First Amendment—could qualify for prohibition under its sweeping standards. To take a few obvious examples, the policy targets "verbal, physical, electronic or other conduct" based on "race," "ethnicity," "religion [or] non-religion," "sex," and "political affiliation." Among the views that Speech First\'s members have said they want to advocate are that "abortion is immoral," that the government "should not be able to force religious organizations to recognize marriages with which they disagree," that "affirmative action is deeply unfair," that "a man cannot become a woman because he \'feels\' like one," that "illegal immigration is dangerous," and that "the Palestinian movement is anti-Semitic."\n\nIn a concurring opinion, Judge Stanley Marcus warned against "the grave peril posed by a policy that effectively polices adherence to intellectual dogma."\n\n"History provides us with ample warning of those times and places when colleges and universities have stopped pursuing truth and have instead turned themselves into cathedrals for the worship of certain dogma," wrote Marcus. "By depriving itself of academic institutions that pursue truth over any other concern, a society risks falling into the abyss of ignorance. Humans are not smart enough to have ideas that lie beyond challenge and debate."\n\nThe Volokh Conspiracy has more on the ruling (which includes the lovely line "the state is a really big boy") here.\n\nFREE MARKETS\n\nPrivate space mission on its way back to earth. The first privately-funded trip to the International Space Station started its return trip yesterday. More from CNN:\n\nThe mission, called AX-1, was brokered by the Houston, Texas-based startup Axiom Space, which books rocket rides, provides all the necessary training, and coordinates flights to the ISS for anyone who can afford it. The four crew members—Michael López-Alegría, a former NASA astronaut-turned-Axiom employee who is commanding the mission; Israeli businessman Eytan Stibbe; Canadian investor Mark Pathy; and Ohio-based real estate magnate Larry Connor—left the space station aboard their SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule on Sunday at 9:10 pm EST….They will spend about one day free flying through orbit before plummeting back into the atmosphere and parachuting to a splashdown landing off the coast of Florida around 1 pm ET Monday. AX-1, which launched on April 8, was originally billed as a 10-day mission, but delays extended the mission by about a week.\n\nThis isn\'t the first time private citizens have been able to pay for seats on spacecraft. "But AX-1 is the first mission with a crew entirely comprised of private citizens with no active members of a government astronaut corps accompanying them in the capsule during the trip to and from the ISS," reports CNN.

I do not want to get into any conversation about [former Vice President Mike] Pence pardoning,” McCarthy says in the Jan. 10 recording as part of a broader conversation about Trump potentially resigning after the riot.\n\nExperts say the committee may want to zero in on that exchange, as the audio shows Republicans at the highest level may have been worried about the legality of Trump’s actions leading up to Jan. 6.\n\n“You would not want to be the middleman in a conversation about Trump being pardoned by Pence because [McCarthy] would be concerned about somebody saying he obstructed justice in some way,” said Jeff Robbins, a former U.S. attorney who also served as chief counsel for the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.\n\n“There’s no need to have a personal fear about being involved in a pardon conversation unless there’s been some suggestion of a conversation about a pardon. And there’s no need to have a discussion about a pardon unless people within McCarthy’s sphere are having serious discussions about Trump’s culpability in a crime,” he added.\n\n“And there’s no need for a pardon if all you’ve done is something that is immoral or unethical or optically bad. The need for a pardon exists when there is criminal culpability.”\n\nThe conversation itself, Robbins said, suggests such questions were likely a topic of conversation among McCarthy and other high-ranking Republicans between Jan. 6 and Jan. 10.\n\nThe select committee has asked McCarthy to voluntarily speak with the committee’s investigators — an invitation he rebuffed.\n\nAmong the things the panel outlined to the minority leader were a desire to speak about his conversations with Trump during and after the attack, as well as prior reports that McCarthy said the former president admitted to being somewhat responsible for the attack — a line receiving renewed attention after being relayed in audio recordings of McCarthy.\n\n“I think it is very important that Kevin McCarthy has evidence the former president acknowledged bearing some responsibility for that attack on the Capitol. This is an admission of guilt by the former president,” Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) told CBS News.\n\n“The reports of what the president said, that he understood that he bore responsibility, that’s consciousness of his guilt. And it is an important element of piecing together all of the facts relative to Jan. 6,” Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), another committee member, told the outlet.\n\nThe criminality of Trump’s actions has been of keen interest to the committee, which recently argued in a civil case that one of his attorneys could not claim attorney-client privilege to shield documents, as such an exception is not valid when legal advice was given in furtherance of a crime. A judge largely agreed with the committee and ordered John Eastman to turn over new documents.\n\nBut Robbins said the discussion around a pardon could be more illuminating when it comes to guilt.\n\n“Saying that he accepted some responsibility is too vague, it could mean a lot of different things,” he said.\n\n“The conclusion that the former president may have actually committed a federal crime comes into play in reference to his personal fear in getting involved in a conversation about a pardon,” he added. “Letting down the American people, none of that implicates any requirement for a pardon. Crimes require pardons.”\n\nBut Michael Stern, who previously served as \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bspecial counsel to the House Intelligence Committee, said the pardon conversation may not carry as much water with Trump, who frequently asserted well before Jan. 6 that he may even be able to pardon himself and used the legal tool heavily while in office.\n\nAnd while McCarthy may have wanted to steer clear of any conversation that involved a quid pro quo, the discussion itself doesn’t indicate guilt related to Jan. 6, Stern said.\n\n“There are many things that [Trump’s] being investigated for which don’t have anything to do with Jan. 6 and which probably are more legally dangerous for him. So [I wouldn’t] draw the conclusion that this was specifically about potential legal jeopardy related to Jan. 6, as opposed to just Trump would recognize the fact that if he left the presidency, with respect to Jan. 6 or lots of other things, he’s going to face a lot of investigations,” and may seek a pardon as a “sweetener” for leaving office, Stern said.\n\nBut getting those details would be difficult, he added.\n\n“As far as if this is something that the committee is interested in, the problem that they have is the problem they have with all of these members, which is they really don’t have a practical way of forcing them to testify,” Stern said.\n\nHe added that while a subpoena is “theoretically available … I just don’t think politically or institutionally it’s going to be something they’re willing to use.”\n\nThere is one member of the committee who may have some insight: Vice Chairwoman Liz Cheney (Wyo.), one of the panel’s two Republicans, who can be heard on the call with McCarthy.\n\n“What’s most notable about it is that it sounds as though he believes that nobody else on the call needs to have a further explanation of it. That is to say, it sounds as if he knows that the question of a potential pardon by Pence has come up in some form. He doesn’t explain what he means, he doesn’t tell people the reason I’m raising this is X, Y, or Z,” Robbins said. “It sounds as though people or their staffs have already been discussing the question of whether or not, for instance, his resignation should be linked in any way to a potential pardon.”\n\nWhile the call could hold value for the committee, it’s less clear it will be of any use to the Department of Justice.\n\n“I don’t think the McCarthy tapes shed any light on a criminal investigation. I think it is harmful to him politically, in that it shows that he appreciated the gravity of Trump’s conduct at one time,” said Barbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney.\n\nIt also might be of more political than investigative value to the committee, which is gearing up for hearings as early as May.\n\n“They need to make a decision about when to just sort of move forward with the information that they have, because they can’t just keep getting more information forever,” said Molly Reynolds, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution who has focused on the committee’s work.\n\nThe committee has been debating whether its final report on the matter should include a recommendation to the Department of Justice to pursue charges against Trump — a referral the department may not chose to take.\n\nBut Reynolds said the bigger picture for the committee is making a compelling case for the public.\n\n“The select committee has a different job than the Department of Justice. The select committee’s job is to hold people accountable in a public way for behavior — some of which may be criminal and some of which may not be —and to tell the story in a way that gets its arms around as much of what happened as possible,” she said.\n\n“That’s hard, but that’s their job.”', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/mccarthykevin_030122gn4_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:50'}

This afternoon, the board accepted Musk\'s offer to buy the company for $54.20 a share.\n\nLong a Twitter power user/troll/loudmouth, Musk bought a 9.2 percent stake in the company last month, becoming the largest shareholder, before deciding he\'d rather have the whole thing.\n\nCue hysteria! Musk haters have taken to the site to declare that Donald Trump will now probably win the 2024 election, that Musk\'s bid is really about white power, that Section 230 must be reformed, and that, yes, Musk\'s new policies will be lethal. (Perhaps the death toll will be even larger than net neutrality\'s!)\n\nSo, for users of the platform, what\'s likely to change?\n\nMusk has panned the site\'s existing content moderation policies, saying they are too restrictive and encroach on people\'s ability to speak freely without being censored. Some liberalization of these policies and the re-platforming of controversial figures like former President Donald Trump—who was banned in the wake of the January 6 riot for inciting violence among his fans—seems likely, though unpopular with droves of users.\n\nAt the mid-April TED conference in Vancouver, Musk talked about his interest in making Twitter\'s algorithm open-source. The Diff\'s Byrne Hobart took this a step further, outlining how "Twitter should monetize a protocol rather than run an app," and explaining the tension between Twitter as a consumer product and as "a way for individual users to update a universal shared database, which can then be filtered based on who\'s interested in what." Hobart claims that it\'s possible that Twitter has been "radically miss-monetized," and that Musk could potentially realign its priorities. However, little of the online discourse has focused on the technical possibilities.\n\nThe new Twitter owner has, through coy tweets, hinted that his new policies will not be applied arbitrarily and that consistent application will mean some number of right-wing users currently cheering his new ownership will surely be disappointed:\n\nI hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 25, 2022\n\nA social media platform\'s policies are good if the most extreme 10% on left and right are equally unhappy — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 19, 2022\n\nElsewhere, Musk has said that Twitter is a "town square" or "public square," and that banning people from using the platform effectively prevents them from participating in the important discussions of the day.\n\nThough people who care about fostering a culture of free speech may agree with the tenor of Musk\'s comments, the analogy is a terrible one. For most of America, the public square is the school board meeting and the town council meeting. There are also numerous other privates spaces for civic engagement: the church pulpit and the post-sermon fray it inspires; neighborhood listservs and the cesspool that is NextDoor; or maybe it\'s Facebook, in-person conversations, and email lists. For many millions of Americans, Twitter is not integral to hashing out values, concerns, and disagreements. Think of the implications if we expected the government to treat such companies—which have their own terms of service and standards that they are free to decide and we are free to consent to—as something akin to public utilities.\n\nIf anything, the new owner of a social media company should convey an inflated sense of the platform\'s worth! But Musk has at times, despite his forceful defense of free speech culture on the internet, repeated confused talking points that indicate scattered thinking while simultaneously failing to fully flesh out what day-to-day operations will look like. For example, a lot of content moderation involves the unsexy—and not very ideological—challenge of keeping spam under control. And, as Mike Masnick points out at Techdirt, Musk doesn\'t seem to have a particularly robust understanding of "hate speech" and how much of what we call hate speech is, in fact, protected by the First Amendment.\n\nA lot remains to be seen about how Twitter will change and what Musk will bring to the table. Optimism, with some reservations about Musk\'s ability to execute, seems warranted. Hysteria—like declaring that it\'s now open season for white supremacists, that Musk\'s vision for free speech will be "lethal," or that Musk is an echo of imperialist, colonizer forebears because he wants to go to Mars—is not.', 'image': 'https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2022/04/thumbnail-9-3.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:46'}

Therefore, going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people.”\n\nBreton spoke as human rights groups reacted to the Twitter board accepting Musk’s bid with warnings of damaging consequences if the billionaire’s commitment to free speech results in a loosening of restrictions on harmful content.\n\nAmnesty International said it was concerned about any decision that Twitter may take after Musk’s takeover to erode enforcement of the policies and mechanisms designed to moderate hate speech online.\n\n“The last thing we need is a Twitter that wilfully turns a blind eye to violent and abusive speech against users, particularly those most disproportionately impacted, including women, non-binary persons, and others,” Michael Kleinman, director of technology and human rights at Amnesty International USA,\n\nDeborah Brown, a digital rights researcher and advocate at Human Rights Watch, said even small changes to the platform could have a devastating impact.\n\nThe UK is also introducing a tougher regulatory regime for digital platforms with the online safety bill, which requires businesses such as Twitter and Facebook to protect users from harmful content and carries the threat of fines of up to 10% of global turnover for breaches.\n\nImran Ahmed, chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a campaign group, said: “The UK and the EU are going to have tools to deal with this.

Musk paid $44 billion to acquire the social media platform with the stated aim of turning it into a haven for "free speech."\n\nThe web is awash in speculation over what that means. Conservatives and people booted off the platform have pushed for Musk to reinstate banned accounts, including that of former President Donald Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, prominent Twitter figures are now saying they\'ll leave the platform in protest of its new owner. Among them is English actress Jameela Jamil, who tweeted her fears Monday that Musk "is going to help this hell platform reach its final form of totally lawless hate, bigotry, and misogyny."\n\nIt\'s unclear whether Musk will be able to realize all his plans for Twitter. The tech leader has floated less moderation, less advertising and an open-source algorithm. But Musk\'s stated ideals contradict his own actions.\n\nWhat Musk says he wants\n\nMusk has made clear he wants less moderation — which he considers censorship — on the platform.\n\n"Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated," he said in Monday\'s announcement about the acquisition.\n\nHe also said he wants to defeat the "spambots," or automated accounts that mimic real users; open the algorithm to public inspection and "authenticate all humans" using the platform.\n\nMusk laid out a definition of speech in a TED interview last week.\n\n"A good sign as to whether there is free speech is, is someone you don\'t like allowed to say something you don\'t like? If that is the case, we have free speech," he said.\n\nMusk said Twitter would abide by national laws that restrict speech around the world. Beyond that, he said, he\'d be "very reluctant" to delete posts or permanently ban users who violate the company\'s rules.\n\nHe had previously criticized Trump\'s ban from social media in the wake of the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Twitter and Facebook permanently banned Trump\'s account on the grounds that he incited violence.\n\n"A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech," Musk tweeted days after Trump was banned from both Facebook and Twitter.\n\nHow Musk responds to disagreement\n\nMusk\'s own history, however, puts in doubt his commitment to let people he doesn\'t like speak. As the newsletter Popular Information has documented, Musk has regularly blocked users who criticize him or Tesla; threatened pro-union Tesla employees and company whistleblowers; and has aggressively gone after short-sellers and journalists who are critical of Tesla, sometimes calling their work "false" or "misleading."\n\nIn 2018, he launched a vendetta against Linette Lopez, an Insider journalist critical of Tesla, a move which writer Felix Salmon called "obsessive and deranged."\n\nMusk\'s popular tweets typically send a swarm of his social media fans directly to the accounts of reporters to harass them for hours or days.\n\nSome academics say that Musk\'s hands-off approach threatens to bring Twitter to its bad old days, when harassment and abuse were rampant.\n\n"With Musk, his posturing of free speech — just leave everything up — that would be bad in and of itself," said Paul Barrett, the deputy director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University. "If you stop moderating — with automated systems and human reviews — a site like Twitter, in the space of a short period of time, you would have a cesspool."\n\nSome former Twitter employees are also dismayed by Musk\'s successful bid for the company.\n\n"Twitter is going to let a man-child essentially take over their platform," said Leslie Miley, a former Twitter employee who has also worked for Google and Apple. Miley, who was the only Black engineer at Twitter in a leadership position when he left the company in 2015, echoed doubts shared by others about Musk\'s grasp of the platform\'s complexities.\n\n"I am not sure if Elon knows what he is getting," Miley said. "He may just find that having Twitter is a lot different than wanting Twitter."\n\nUnfettered expression does not attract advertisers\n\nA decade ago, a Twitter executive called the company "the free speech wing of the free speech party," underscoring its commitment to untrammeled freedom of expression. But the company reversed itself after reports of online abuse and harassment became frequent.\n\nIn the U.S., a visceral 2014 article by journalist Amanda Hess exposed the incessant, vile harassment many women faced just for posting on Twitter or other online forums. Twitter also learned about the consequences of an unmoderated social platform: mainly, that it undercut their funding from advertisers.\n\nAds are how Twitter makes money, and companies generally don\'t want their ads running against violent threats, hate speech that bleeds into incitement or incendiary information aimed at tipping elections or undermining public health.\n\nGoogle, Barrett pointed out, quickly learned this lesson the hard way when major companies like Toyota and Anheuser-Busch yanked their ads after they ran ahead of YouTube videos produced by extremists in 2015.\n\nOnce it was clear just how unhealthy the conversation had gotten, Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey spent years trying to improve what he called the "health" of the conversation on the platform.\n\nThe company was an early adopter of the "report abuse" button after U.K. member of parliament Stella Creasy received a barrage of rape and death threats on the platform. The online abuse was the result of a seemingly positive tweet in support of feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez, who successfully advocated for novelist Jane Austen to appear on a British banknote. Creasy\'s online harasser was sent to prison for 18 weeks.\n\nTwitter has continued to craft rules and invest in staff and technology that detected violent threats, harassment and misinformation that violated its policies. After evidence emerged that Russia used Twitter\'s platforms to try to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election, social media companies stepped up their efforts against political misinformation. All have struggled with defining "misinformation," however, and been accused of both leaving up false content as well as over-censoring legitimate posts.\n\nHard to unwind moderation\n\nThe big question now is how far Musk wants to ratchet back these systems — and whether users and advertisers will stick around if he does.\n\nLike Miley, the former Twitter engineer, experts who have studied content moderation and researched Twitter express doubt that Musk knows what he is getting into. After all, there are plenty of fledgling examples of so-called free speech-focused platforms that have been launched in the past few years as Twitter alternatives, largely by conservatives unhappy with the Twitter\'s crackdown on hate, harassment and misinformation. Many such sites have struggled to deal with toxic content, and at least one has been cut off by its own technology providers in protest.\n\n"This move just shows how effective (moderation features) have been to annoy those in power," said Kirsten Martin, a professor of technology ethics at the University of Notre Dame. "I would be worried as to how this would change Twitter\'s values."\n\nThe fact that no other bidders emerged in public before Musk\'s deal was a sign that other would-be acquirers might find Twitter too difficult to improve, said Third Bridge analyst Scott Kessler.\n\n"This platform is pretty much the same one we\'ve had over the last decade or so," Kessler said. "You\'ve had a lot of smart people trying to figure out what they should do, and they\'ve had trouble.

Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) questioned Garland on the matter, pointing out that Joe Biden’s messengers, including White House chief of staff Ronald Klain, have said on national television that the president is confident his son, Hunter Biden, did nothing wrong.\n\n“The president’s already told his subordinates—clearly, these are people he can fire at will—that he and his family did nothing wrong. How can the American people be confident that his administration is conducting a serious investigation?” Hagerty asked.\n\n“Because we put the investigation in the hands of a Trump appointee, from the previous administration, who’s the United States attorney for the District of Delaware, and because you have me as the attorney general, who is committed to the independence of the Justice Department from any influence from the White House in criminal matters,” Garland, a Biden appointee, responded.\n\nThe probe was first revealed by Hunter Biden in late 2020. He claimed that prosecutors were investigating his “tax affairs.”\n\nDavid Weiss, the U.S. attorney for Delaware, later confirmed the investigation but has declined to share any details.\n\nA grand jury subpoena showed that prosecutors compelled banks to share financial records of Hunter Biden and the president’s brother, James Biden. Additionally, the mother of one of Hunter Biden’s children has said she testified to authorities pursuant to a subpoena.\n\nHagerty pressed Garland on whether a special counsel is appropriate, considering the public comments by Klain and White House communications director Kate Bedingfield.\n\n“There’s an obvious conflict of interest here. Because those who are investigating the Biden family and their enterprise can be fired by the head of the family who is being investigated,” Hagerty said.\n\nGarland declined to say whether the department has or is considering appointing a special counsel, though he noted that special counsels are also employees of the Department of Justice.\n\nHe also would not answer when asked if he agreed with the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller, who was tasked with investigating allegations of collusion between Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia.\n\n“The question of whether to have a special counsel is one that is internal decision-making in the department, so I don’t want to make any judgments one way or the other,” Garland told Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) later in the hearing. “I’m quite comfortable with the United States attorney for that district continuing in the role that he’s playing.”', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/26/garland-before-senate-1200x800.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:30'}

In Canada, vaccine-free Canadians still cannot board a train or a plane and travel from one region of the country to another.\n\nIn Canada, air and train travel are regulated by the federal government, even when you travel within the same province. The feds have made it so only a vaccine passport, or very limited jab exemptions, will afford you the opportunity to visit family, friends, or travel for work.\n\nThis means that if you lived in, let’s say, Kitchener, Ontario, you could not get on a VIA Rail train and travel to Toronto… even though you could travel from Kitchener to Toronto on a commuter train that is not under federal jurisdiction.\n\nIsn’t “science” wonderful!\n\nOh, and vaccine-free Canadians also can’t LEAVE the country. Unjabbed Canadians are told they can’t “put others at risk” by boarding a plane with vaccinated people (because vaccines suddenly…work?). Apparently, it is good for the unvaccinated to stay in Canada, even though … they are risk to everyone else who is protected by a vaccine?\n\nTrudeau’s insecurity on display\n\nNow, on the one hand it is quite easy to understand why Trudeau is acting like an evil dictator: he has proven himself to be an immoral tyrant on many occasions. However, given the fact that other leftist tyrants have eased up, it is clearly not just leftism or progressivism that causing him to trap Canadians indefinitely in their home like real-life versions of The Truman Show. (How fitting that it was Canadian Jim Carrey who starred in that film.)\n\nThere is something unique about Trudeau that is causing him to become “regressive” as the rest of the leftist dominated West is affording vaccine-free citizens their civil rights.\n\nTo the outside world, Trudeau may look like a confident – if not cringeworthy – tin-pot dictator, but in reality, he is a 50-year-old boy with little to no virtue. He is essentially a spoiled teenager who can remember lines and present himself well in a tailored suit and has a family name that tricked people into thinking he was competent.\n\nHis (Canadian) father, Pierre Trudeau, for all his faults, was shrewd and intelligent – even if evil. Justin Trudeau is evil and unintelligent and quite obtuse.\n\nI can’t help but think he believes he must prove himself as being his own verified dictator in order to fill his daddy’s shoes. Simply put, he is insecure and projecting.\n\n— Article continues below Petition — PETITION: Ask Elon Musk to REINSTATE LifeSite\'s Twitter accounts Show Petition Text 7936 have signed the petition.

Sign this Petition Please SIGN and SHARE this petition to the new owner of Twitter, Elon Musk, asking him to reinstate LifeSiteNews\' truth-telling Twitter accounts which have been suspended since early 2021. After contentious negotiations, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has purchased Twitter, thereby transforming the tech giant into a private company. A self-styled "free speech absolutist," Mr. Musk\'s entrepreneurial spirit may define his approach to governing Twitter, where, in the marketplace of ideas, the best ideas - not those aided by censorship - will naturally prevail among the competition. Of course, there are limits to free speech. But, for too long, Big Tech giants (including, Twitter, Google, YouTube and Facebook) have subjected their conservative and Christian users to all forms of censorship, desperately trying to silence our voices. So if, as it seems, Mr. Musk will level the playing field for conservatives and Christians and allow a true exchange of ideas to occur on his platform, then we look forward to our chance to re-engage on Twitter. Please SIGN and SHARE this petition to the new owner of Twitter, Elon Musk, asking him to reactivate LifeSiteNews\' truth-telling Twitter accounts which have been suspended since early 2021. They are: https://twitter.com/LifeSite\n\nhttps://twitter.com/LSNCatholic\n\nhttps://twitter.com/WCDM_LSN\n\nhttps://twitter.com/WCEA_LSN These accounts have been blocked by the outgoing Twitter regime for more than a year for calling a ‘transgender woman’ (Assistant Secretary of Health, \'Rachel\' Levine), a man, and for tweeting an article about the same person. The article we tweeted makes mention of the troubling paradox of having a person who denies the basic science of the human anatomy be in an authoritative position in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), but does not cast aspersions or any other such “hate speech” against Levine, according to Twitter’s "rules." It is our fervant hope that Mr. Musk intends to allow - rather than censor - our descriptions of reality as we know them to be true in regards to human sexuality, as well as in other areas of life. Mr. Musk evidently understands how significant freedom of speech is to the functioning of a free society as he was quoted as saying that this deal is important for "the future of civlization." LifeSiteNews believes that being able to spread the truth in charity is absolutely vital for the future of society, as the "truth shall make you free." (Jn 8:32) And so, in order for us to charitably spread the truth far and wide, we now seek to re-engage on Twitter\'s public square.

The New Democrats have cozied up to Trudeau in order to pretend they are a sane and legitimate party and have promised to prop up his regime. Promises don’t really mean anything when politicians make them, so we shouldn’t assume that the communists will be loyal to each other.\n\nHowever, it is obvious that public opinion is against Trudeau to a degree that he will not be able to withstand.\n\nThere is a reason why Trudeau had to resort to the Emergencies Act to squash the Freedom Convoy; no one wanted to stop it until they were forced to by law.\n\nThe various levels of provincial and municipal governance could have stopped the movement the way they stop any non-violent protest – but they didn’t want to.\n\nDoes this mean that the cops and all the citizens supported the convoy? Of course not, but I think that enough of them saw how absurd things have become and just wanted something to make the whole charade of 2020-2021-2022 go away.\n\nThe application of the Emergencies Act was wildly unpopular among Canadians, both on the Left and the Right. Leftists were happy to see the movement end but were unimpressed that Trudeau ended it in such an absurd way. Conservatives generally supported the movement, and therefore saw Trudeau as a complete lunatic for doing what he did.\n\nAll of this means that in the long run Trudeau is hurting his reputation, even among his base. This is not news for him as the Conservative leadership race heats up.\n\nFreedom is on the move\n\nWithout giving the impression that I think Canada is on the brink of some massive societal restoration, I would be remiss if I did not speak to the positives.\n\nCurrently, we are witnessing the first real Conservative leadership race in a long time. Pierre Pollievre is filling arenas and convention centres with freedom-loving crowds, and Leslyn Lewis is making leftist journalists look silly on national TV. It is worth remembering that we are talking about a leadership race, not an election, but the swell of right-wing uprising is palpable.\n\nIn fact, the last time something like this happened was after a groundswell of Christian/right-wing sentiment following years of leftist oppression under the former Trudeau and his successors.\n\nAs a result of that, we had Stephen Harper for a decade who, although not perfect, was a saint compared with Trudeau.\n\nThe economy is tanking in Canada, and goods and services are becoming prohibitively expensive for average people. Trudeau and his cronies can appeal to idealism and progressivism all they want, but even left-wingers get ticked off and want change when they are struggling to fill the tank.\n\nUltimately, Trudeau is continuing to trap vaccine-free Canadians from participating fully in society because he knows that if he pulls the plug on his last failing restriction, that his regime will go down the drain.\n\nKennedy Hall is an Ontario based journalist for LifeSiteNews.

The board [of Twitter] will have to make sure that if it operates in Europe it will have to fulfill the obligations, including moderation, open algorithms, freedom of speech, transparency in rules, obligations to comply with our own rules for hate speech, revenge porn [and] harassment," said Breton, adding "If [Twitter] does not comply with our law, there are sanctions — 6 per cent of the revenue and, if they continue, banned from operating in Europe."', 'image': 'https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2022-04/musk%202.jpg?itok=_6ovvCP5', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:12'}

But the Tesla chief executive’s amorphous vow to restore free speech to the social media platform has resonated among Republicans, who see themselves — starting with their de facto leader, former President Trump — as unfairly targeted by Twitter’s content moderation efforts.\n\nConservatives said their euphoric outpouring was bigger than the possible return of @RealDonaldTrump and changes to Twitter’s ownership. Rather, they see Musk’s takeover as a symbolic, and cathartic, blow against Big Tech, which the right has increasingly viewed with antipathy.\n\n“There’s a gut reaction from a lot of people, going, ‘You know what, it’s about time they get their comeuppance,’ ” said Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.). “It finally feels like someone is standing up for a principle that has been going in an opposite direction lately: less free speech, less ability to express yourself — if you are a conservative.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk centered his bid for Twitter on the premise that the social media company, which he considers a “digital town square,” is too restrictive in clamping down on expression.\n\n“I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” Musk tweeted Monday morning.\n\nMusk’s own politics are idiosyncratic. He’s the foremost face of clean vehicles who called for immediately increasing oil and gas production after the Ukraine-Russia war spiked energy prices. He fled California for Texas because of high taxes but declined to weigh in on Texas’ restrictive abortion law, saying he preferred to “stay out of politics.” He has described himself as politically independent and registered to vote in California with no party preference.\n\nFor conservatives, Musk’s crusade against content restrictions has struck a chord. Roughly half of Republicans feel they cannot express themselves freely on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, according to a Morning Consult poll conducted this month, far exceeding the percentage of Democrats and independents who felt similarly.\n\nPolitics Who did Twitter ban during the Trump era, and why? Could banned Trump allies return to Twitter under Elon Musk? A look at the former president’s backers who were kicked off the social media platform.\n\n“Twitter is a platform that I and many others believe has been more aggressive in blocking Republicans and conservatives than they have toward people on the left,” said Rep. Austin Scott (R-Ga.). “I’m hoping and expecting he will undo that.”\n\nScott is not an avid Twitter user; he does not even have the app on his phone. But he did tweet a congratulatory message to Musk, adding a plea to “restore free speech and bring back President Trump!”\n\nTrump was permanently kicked off the platform on Jan. 8, 2021 — two days after a group of his supporters overran the U.S. Capitol in hopes of blocking the certification of Joe Biden’s win. Twitter imposed the ban “due to the risk of further incitement of violence.”\n\nSo far, Musk has not indicated how he’d handle the former president’s account. Trump, meanwhile, has shown no interest in rejoining the platform that helped power his political rise and gave real-time narration of his presidency.\n\n“I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,” Trump told Fox News, referring to his fledgling social media network. “I hope Elon buys Twitter, because he’ll make improvements to it, and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth.”\n\nRepublicans see Trump as just one example of Twitter’s bias. A number of high-profile conservatives have been suspended or blocked from the platform, including the account of the Babylon Bee, a satirical news website that was suspended for a tweet naming Assistant Health Secretary Rachel Levine, who is transgender, “Man of the Year.”\n\nThe account was locked as a violation of Twitter’s ban on hate speech. Seth Dillon, CEO of Babylon Bee, refused to remove the tweet, asserting that “truth is not hate speech.”\n\n“It’s completely broken,” said Harmeet Dhillon, a conservative lawyer who has sued Twitter multiple times on behalf of clients who were banned. “The company can try to affect elections, try to ban politicians from speaking ... use algorithms, enable false accounts to constantly affect what people see.”\n\nThe extent to which conservatives face bias on the platform has been fiercely examined and debated. A study this month by researchers at MIT and Yale found that Republican users tend to be suspended more often than Democrats but that conservatives are more likely to share misinformation that would provoke such suspensions.\n\nSo far, Musk has offered little explanation as to how his free speech values would play out in practice. He said on Monday that his goals include “enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots and authenticating all humans.”\n\nBut such efforts would require some attempt at regulating content, especially by verifying users. A social media network without any moderation at all could swamp the platform with all sorts of unsavory or offensive material, such as pornography or terrorist content, as well as the online abuse and harassment that are already common occurrences.\n\n“If you don’t have content moderation, you actually have less free speech. The people who are the loudest are the bullies and harassers that drive people away,” said Katie Harbath, a former Republican operative who has worked as public policy director for Facebook.\n\nDhillon, the conservative attorney based in California, said she is not hoping for Musk to completely abandon regulation.\n\n“There’s plenty of room for them to do old-school content moderation of the kind they originally did,” she said, citing as an example prohibitions on making death threats.\n\nWith Musk’s plans still unknown, Harbath, who now runs a tech policy strategy firm, said the celebratory conservatives “are making a hell of a lot of assumptions of what Elon means by all this stuff. I don’t think they should assume he is completely on their side.”\n\nRepublicans’ triumphant tone on Twitter starkly contrasted with the more muted reaction from liberal politicians. Far fewer Democratic members of Congress weighed in on Twitter, although those who did were markedly unenthused.\n\n“This deal is dangerous for our democracy. Billionaires like Elon Musk play by a different set of rules than everyone else, accumulating power for their own gain. We need a wealth tax and strong rules to hold Big Tech accountable,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), with whom Musk has sparred on Twitter.\n\nHuizenga, the Michigan congressman, expected that liberals would be none too pleased with Musk’s purchase. Indeed, some vowed to leave the site entirely — much to Huizenga’s amusement.\n\n“It seems like ‘I’m quitting Twitter’ has become the ‘I’m moving to Canada if Trump wins,’ ” he said, adding, “It’s kind of fun sitting back, watching them completely lose their collective minds.”', 'image': 'https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ac14b68/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2941x1544+0+208/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F86%2F23%2Ff46440b54bd7a6509db9c67caab5%2Fphilanthropy-billionaries-tax-28080.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:57'}

(Patrick Pleul/Pool/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nElon Musk Reveals More Details of His Plans for Twitter After Buyout\n\nElon Musk revealed more details of what he has in mind for changes at Twitter after it was confirmed that the company had accepted his buyout offer, with the tech mogul’s plans including new features and ways to enhance trust in the platform.\n\nTwitter’s board of directors said on April 25 that it had approved Musk’s offer to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share in cash, in a deal worth around $44 billion.\n\nThe buyout represents a 38 percent premium over Twitter’s closing stock price on April 1, with Parag Agrawal, CEO of Twitter, saying in a statement that he believes the deal “is the best path forward for Twitter’s stockholders.”\n\n‘Bedrock of a Functioning Democracy’\n\nIn a statement, Musk provided some details about what kind of changes he has in mind for the social media platform, whose commitment to free speech he has repeatedly called into question.\n\n“Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,” Musk said. This dovetails with his earlier statements that Twitter functions as a “de facto town square” where important conversations should be able to take place with as few constraints as possible.\n\nMusk said Monday that Twitter has “tremendous potential” and that he wants to work with the company and its users to “unlock” and make the platform “better than ever.”\n\nHe said he plans on “enhancing” Twitter with new features, which he did not provide further details on. Musk earlier created a Twitter poll asking users if they want an edit button on the platform, suggesting that this could be one of the changes he is seeking to effect.\n\nMusk also said on Monday he wants to make the platform’s algorithms “open source to increase trust,” while “defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.”\n\nThis, too, reinforces his earlier remarks that his objective in seeking to buy Twitter and turn it into a private company was to transform it into a bastion of free speech by opening up its algorithm to public scrutiny and by making its moderation policies more transparent.\n\n‘Black Box Algorithm’\n\nA self-described “free speech absolutist,” Musk told the audience at a recent TED event in Vancouver, Canada, that Twitter should permit unconstrained expression, though it should do so in line with the law.\n\n“In my view, Twitter should match the laws of the country,” Musk said, acknowledging reasonable legal caps on free speech like direct incitement to violence or shouting “fire” in a crowded theater.\n\n“But going beyond that and having it be unclear who’s making what changes to where, having tweets mysteriously be promoted and demoted with no insight into what’s going on, having a black box algorithm promote some things and not other things, I think this can be quite dangerous,” Musk said.\n\n“My strong, intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization,” he added.\n\nErr on Side of Free Speech\n\nMusk also expressed reluctance about permanent bans of users from Twitter, preferring instead temporary “time-outs.”\n\n“I’m not saying that I have all the answers here,” Musk said at the TED talk. But I do think that we want to be just very reluctant to delete things, just be very cautious with permanent bans. Timeouts I think are better than permanent bans.”\n\nIn terms of calibrating Twitter’s moderation policies, Musk said he’d want to err on the side of free speech.\n\n“If in doubt, let the speech, let it exist,” Musk said. “If it’s a grey area, I would say let the tweet exist. But obviously in a case where there’s perhaps a lot of controversy, that you would not want to necessarily promote that tweet.”\n\n“A good sign as to whether there’s free speech is, is someone you don’t like allowed to say something you don’t like,” Musk said. “And if that is the case, then we have free speech.”\n\n‘We Are Concerned’\n\nMusk has repeatedly questioned Twitter’s commitment to free speech, after accusations that the platform suppressed some minority and politically conservative viewpoints, claims Twitter has denied.\n\nMany free speech advocates have hailed Musk’s takeover bid, while those opposed have expressed fear that fewer constraints on expression on Twitter will make it too easy to abuse the platform’s reach and power by, for example, spreading disinformation.\n\nIn a series of tweets reacting to Musk’s takeover moves, Amnesty International expressed concern about the erosion of policies meant to protect users.\n\n“We are concerned with any steps that Twitter might take to erode enforcement of the policies and mechanisms designed to protect users,” Amnesty International wrote.\n\n“The last thing we need is a Twitter that wilfully turns a blind eye to violent and abusive speech against users,” the group said.\n\nAs it was confirmed Musk would purchase Twitter, the Tesla founder urged his “worst critics” to stay on the platform.\n\n“I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” he wrote in a Twitter post.\n\nDan Ives, an analyst at investment firm Wedbush Securities, told the BBC that he expects most users will take a “wait-and-see approach” on whether they stay or leave the platform, based on the changes that take place.\n\n“Now it’s about courting new users and stopping defectors from the platform,” Ives told the outlet.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/19/article-image-cal-thomas-3-1200x804.jpeg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:50'}

This feels like the first flashback scene we see in a dystopian drama after the words “SIX MONTHS EARLIER …” Quite where we’ll be in six months’ time as far as Twitter is concerned remains tantalisingly unclear, but it seems difficult to imagine it will be either a more or less pleasant space. It’s a social media platform. I’m not sure what further evidence humanity needs before we cotton on to the idea that such a thing might be an intrinsically toxic concept. Of course, there will always be some people who think it just hasn’t been done right yet. Like communism, or a British version of The Daily Show.\n\nAnyway, if Musk’s takeover goes through, he’ll assume control of a platform where the people on the right are incredibly angry about free speech, and those on the left are incredibly angry about hate speech. Which is to say: they have so much in common. As the tech visionary Jaron Lanier has long been excellent at pointing out, the best way to keep people on platforms is to make them angry. So the platforms are designed to make them angry. You might consider the anger worth it for your version of advertising (I myself will post this column on Twitter), but even then it is a weirdly grim cost of doing business that just conceivably ought to be weighed far more carefully than it is.\n\nUnlike the UK, Musk manufactures other things besides anger, but Twitter is the platform where, in a single calendar year, his posts led to multiple lawsuits, a fall in his stock price, and a Securities and Exchange Commission settlement that resulted in his chairmanship of Tesla being forcibly ended. Yet in a move that will feel familiar to a lot of Twitter users, he has not logged off, but leaned in further. When I was a child, there was a guy called Victor Kiam who owned Remington, and he would personally feature in the firm’s electric razor adverts, going: “I liked the shaver so much, I bought the company.” It would be nice to see Musk do something similar. “I liked calling innocent people paedos so much, I bought the company.”\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the distress of Twitter users feels overplayed. Perhaps Elon embodies a kind of radical honesty and self-awareness not shared by other denizens of the site. People who seem to spend half their lives complaining about Twitter, on Twitter, seem stunned by the idea that a shitposter would ultimately buy it. Catch up! It doesn’t feel like a complete coincidence that all social media platforms are owned by men you’d run a mile from socially.\n\nMusk is one of them – a brilliant, horrid, ridiculous and very occasionally endearing grotesque. A sort of intergalactically successful Dominic Cummings. And yet, despite Elon’s give-a-toss gift for making himself what Twitter users might call the “main character”, I can’t detest him entirely. If he pulls off the radical green energy transition embodied in Tesla, or even just one of his other wildly ambitious schemes, humans might have to accept some of the shit that’s gone with it. Accept it angrily, of course – how else, we’re on a social media platform! – but accept it nonetheless. A huge number of other people in public life behave appallingly and achieve absolutely nothing but harm.\n\nBut if endlessly righteous folk balk at the mere idea of necessary evils, why do they act like their own involvement in Twitter is one? It isn’t. It’s easy to focus on the high-profile people who are always on Twitter. But the sheer numbers of highly successful, highly creative and highly interesting people in the worlds of arts, business, science and beyond who AREN’T on it should tell a much more powerful story. They are part of all kinds of era-defining creative and commercial conversations and breakthroughs – and somehow manage to do it all without lavishing half the day scrolling past a bunch of other people having a row.\n\nLanier has cast detailed doubt on whether most Twitter advocacy is even meaningfully effective, despite sometimes appearing to be so. If you spend your day caught up in online fighting, it’s preferable to tell yourself you’re involved in consciousness-raising for your cause. An alternative view is that you are simply obsessively polarising your particular debate, to the point where compromise – boring, unfashionable, yet historically always necessary – becomes a more distant possibility.\n\nMy “unpopular opinion”, in one of Twitter’s tellingly popular phrases, is that those who spend a significant amount of time arguing on it work for the platform and not for their cause. The Musk takeover at least makes it easier to see whose pocket you’re putting money into as you delude yourself you’re winning arguments. I’m certainly not saying I follow this rule, but in general I think arguing on the internet is like playing real tennis: even if you win, you’re still a twat.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5899b28a3a52d992407b1aa95d2689c2b1d4703f/0_273_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=e4d7eefe6e510bd81cf93360935a1d81', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:53'}

The article was banned for a time by Facebook and Twitter, labelled as “unsubstantiated” by other news outlets and as “Russian disinformation” by intelligence agents and members of the Biden campaign.\n\nThe New York Times published a report last month, more than a year after the fact, claiming to authenticate the emails from the laptop by citing anonymous sources.\n\nThe White House has refused to comment on the laptop in the wake of The New York Times article.\n\nRepublicans in Congress are renewing promises to investigate Hunter Biden with the latest revelations about Schwerin’s access to the White House.\n\n”Not everyone gets to meet the vice president of the United States in the White House. The press should be asking why Hunter Biden’s business associates—like Eric Schwerin—had that privilege and were given access to the Obama White House,” Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) told the New York Post. “This is additional evidence that Joe Biden lied when he said he never discussed Hunter’s foreign business dealings. It’s well past time for the corporate media to demand the truth from Joe Biden. The corruption of Biden Inc. must be exposed.”\n\n“It’s increasingly obvious that Hunter Biden’s business revolved around providing access to his father and the highest levers of power. It reeks of pay-to-play. The clear solution is a Special Counsel investigation to fairly investigate the disturbing allegations of Biden family corruption,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) also told the Post.\n\nThere is currently an active Department of Justice investigation into Hunter Biden’s tax filings.

Earlier this month, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain said on TV that the president is confident that his son didn’t break the law, and the White House communications director said President Biden maintains his position that his son did nothing that was unethical,” Hagerty said.\n\nThe senator asked Garland whether U.S. President Joe Biden had told him his son is innocent.\n\n“Absolutely not,” Garland responded. “He has not done that, and he has committed to not interfere in the investigation.”\n\nHagerty pressed further, asking Garland how the public could be confident there won’t be political interference in the investigation.\n\n“Because we put a Trump appointee in charge of the investigation,” Garland said, referring to Weiss. “And because you have me as attorney general, who’s committed to the independence of the DOJ from any influence from the White House.”\n\nHagerty then asked Garland whether the DOJ was considering assigning a special counsel to investigate Hunter Biden. Garland again declined to comment.\n\nWhen asked under what circumstances a special counsel would be used in the investigation, Garland said, “it depends on the circumstances.”\n\nBraun asked similar questions about a potential special counsel and received similar responses.\n\n“The question is an internal DOJ matter,” Garland repeated. “I don’t want to make judgments, but I’m comfortable with the Attorney from Delaware continuing.”\n\nThe federal investigation into Hunter Biden’s finances was revealed in December 2020, and few updates have been provided since then.\n\nAttorney Clint Lancaster, who represented an Arkansas woman who filed the lawsuit in 2019 alleging that Hunter Biden was the father of her daughter Navy Joan Roberts, told CBS News earlier this month that federal prosecutors subpoenaed the documents from his case.\n\n“They wanted every record relating to Hunter Biden we had,” he said of the paternity case, which was settled in 2020.\n\nLancaster said the records included Hunter Biden’s “affidavit of financial means” during the paternity lawsuit. A financial affidavit is generally a statement showing income, expenses, assets, and liabilities.\n\nAdditionally, he said the tax records he and Roberts provided overlapped during the same time period as Hunter Biden’s foreign business activities.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/1.tagreuters.com2022binary_LYNXNPEI3510J-FILEDIMAGE-1200x833.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:47'}

Garland refused to reveal any internal deliberations against Hunter but noted the investigation is being run by David Weiss, a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nWeiss, a 20-year federal prosecutor, will have to determine if there is enough evidence to seek a federal grand jury indictment against Hunter Biden in an investigation that may end up including other members of the Biden family, such as Joe Biden’s brother James Biden, and potentially the president himself.\n\n“I’m aware of that, but he reports to you,” Hagerty pressed about the investigation under Weiss.\n\n“He is supervising the investigation and I’m not at liberty to talk about internal Justice Department deliberations, but he is in charge of that investigation,” Garland reiterated.\n\nGarland then promised the Biden administration would not interfere in the investigation. “There will not be interference of any political or improper kind.”\n\nHagerty continued his line of questioning by asking if Joe Biden ever told Garland that Hunter did not break any laws, including tax fraud, money laundering, and violation of lobbying laws.\n\n“Absolutely not. And the President has not done that. And the President is committed not to interfere, not only in that investigation but any other kind of investigation,” Garland claimed.\n\nLater in the hearing, Garland refused to say whether a special counsel should be placed over the investigation to maintain a just investigation. A special counsel would provide a degree of separation between Biden’s administration and the investigation.

The instrument indicates a collection of 50 percent of familial salaries for 30 years.\n\n“I hope you all can do what I did and pay for everything for this entire family for 30 years,” Hunter texted to his daughter in 2019. “It’s really hard. But don’t worry, unlike Pop [Joe], I won’t make you give me half your salary.”\n\nThe Biden’s family payment mechanism of collecting 50 percent of family salaries for 30 years could be legal “predicates” for racketeering charges, according to former Utah U.S. attorney Brett Tolman.\n\nFollow Wendell Husebø on Twitter and Gettr @WendellHusebø.

Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.) told reporters following the meeting.\n\n“We are in a different position now than we were in the past,” he said. “There’s ample vaccines available. There is the ability to test and quarantine that work. And so, Title 42 should be lifted, and that we should focus on border management policy in order to make sure that they have the resources in order to move forward.”\n\nBut the administration’s plans to stop enforcing Title 42 were thrown into doubt as the meeting came to a close. A Trump-appointed federal judge in Louisiana said he planned to block the administration’s plans for rescinding the public health order, a win for a group of GOP-led states who sued to stop Biden from moving forward.\n\nThe meeting punctuated internal disagreement in the Democratic Party around the Biden administration’s decision to end enforcement of the Title 42 authority, a public health order that allows border officials to speedily turn away migrants at the U.S. southern border.\n\nImmigration advocates have a litany of concerns about the policy, but at the center of those issues is that it allows officials to forego asylum screenings, blocking persecuted migrants from exercising a right they have under U.S. law.\n\nWhile many support the Biden administration’s decision and indeed wish it had come sooner, others have expressed concern about the plans amid a prolonged spike in border crossings.\n\n“Yes they’re listening to the immigration activists, but my question is who’s listening to the men and women in green and in blue and, more importantly, who is listening to the border communities – the sheriffs, the landowners, the rest of the people who live on the border?” Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), who represents a border community and has raised concerns about the policy decision, said on “Fox News Sunday.”\n\nRep. Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.), who was tasked with presenting the group’s position on Title 42 to Biden, said the meeting touched on a series of issues before turning to immigration, an issue that still led coverage of the meeting.\n\n“The reality is when you talk to Latinos they’re talking about the economy, jobs, air pollution, and so the media is talking about things that are divisive,” said Barragán.\n\nBarragán added that the CHC puts more blame over the immigration policy crisis on former President Trump than on Biden.\n\n“The bottom line is this president walked into a tough situation with a prior administration who dismantled the legal immigration system,” she said.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the meeting was part of Biden’s outreach to individual congressional caucuses. Biden has recently met with the Congressional Progressive Caucus as well as other groups in Congress.\n\nAttendees said that it also covered the implementation of the bipartisan infrastructure law, immigration reform, and environmental justice.\n\nAt one point, an aide to the president walked into the room with a note saying the 30-minute meeting had gone on for 62 minutes.\n\nBiden, rather than keep the information to himself, read the note out loud to laughter from the attendees.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House is facing pressure from immigration advocates to forcefully oppose a bill that has attracted support from moderate senators that would delay an end to the enforcement of Title 42. The White House has not taken a position on the legislation.\n\n“I just wish that the Biden administration would stand up and explain what it’s doing and own it,” said Clara Long, associate director at Human Rights Watch who focuses on immigration and border policy.\n\nPsaki again on Monday said it would be up to Congress to make any changes to CDC’s Title 42 enforcement, but she declined to say whether Biden would sign legislation that did so.\n\n“This would be Congress having the discussion. We are continuing to prepare for a May 23 implementation,” Psaki said. “There will be a range of conversations about this over the coming days.”\n\nThe lawsuits filed by GOP-led states seem to be the biggest immediate threat to the administration’s plans. Some have speculated that the White House would like to see the courts thwart their plans in order to take a hot-button political issue off Biden’s plate.\n\n“I think there’s a theory going around that they’re hoping the courts give them a get-out-of-jail-free card,” said Long.\n\nBiden’s approval ratings are particularly low on his handling of immigration.\n\nA Politico/Morning Consult poll conducted earlier this month found that 54 percent of registered voters oppose Biden’s decision to lift Title 42.\n\nBut a different poll conducted in February by Impact Research for the National Immigration Law Center found that 52 percent of likely 2022 voters support ending Title 42 enforcement.\n\nStill, most CHC members believe that the administration can push forward with its vision of border policy, because Republicans are unlikely to relent from attacking Biden on immigration and the border.\n\n“No matter what the president does, they’re going to make noise. The president and the Democratic-controlled Congress have done amazing things, that’s why econ has improved,” said Rep. Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.), who attended the meeting.\n\n“Republicans don’t want to focus on the glass that’s half full, they want to convince us the glass is half empty,” he added.\n\nSome advocates for ending the policy, which they say represented one prong of the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant agenda, argue that Democrats are risking turning off their base by voicing support for continuing the policy.\n\n“This is a policy that can help you win and the flipside of that is embracing the Republican talking points is not going to help you win those Democratic voters that you desperately need to turn out for you in November,” said Bri Gillis, political director of the National Immigration Law Center’s Immigrant Justice Fund.\n\nStill, some Democrats say the discussion of Title 42 is moot.\n\n“There’s nothing to debate, you’re either for Title 42 or you’re not,” said Rep. Lou Correa (D-Calif.), a CHC member who did not attend the meeting.\n\n“Everybody’s talking abt Title 42 when that’s not the issue. The real issue is American industrial might, nearshoring of American jobs from China, creating a stronger manufacturing base, and a lot of that relies on immigrants. And we’re talking about Title 42. Doesn’t even come close to addressing the bigger public policy issues in this country and that’s what everybody’s talking about. And it’s hurting us,” said Correa.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/ruizraul_031821gn_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:41'}

They stole this election. We all know. They will destroy our country next.”\n\nThe message about Trump potentially invoking martial law, earlier reported by CNN on Monday and confirmed by the Guardian, came a month after the idea had been raised in a heated Oval Office meeting a month before, where Trump considered ways to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nMeadows did not appear to respond to Greene’s text. But the messages Trump’s top White House aide was receiving shows the extraordinary ideas swirling around Trump after he and his operatives were unable to stop the certification of Biden’s election win on January 6.\n\nGreene – one of Trump’s fiercest far-right defenders on Capitol Hill – also texted Meadows days before the Capitol attack asking about how to prepare for objections to Biden’s win at the joint session of Congress, the text messages show.\n\n“Good morning Mark, I’m here in DC. We have to get organized for the 6th,” Greene wrote on 31 December. “I would like to meet with Rudy Giuliani again. We didn’t get to speak with him long. Also anyone who can help. We are getting a lot of members on board.”\n\nThat text message from Greene, who had not yet been sworn in as a member of Congress, a week before the Capitol attack also underscores her close relationship with the Trump White House and an extraordinary level of coordination to obstruct Biden being certified as president.\n\nBut the text messages that Meadows did not turn over to the select committee – as opposed to the communications he agreed to produce for the investigation – were perhaps more notable as the panel investigates connections between the White House and the Capitol attack.\n\nThe panel is aware, for instance, that Meadows had contacts through December 2020 and January 2021 with organizers of the Save America rally at the Ellipse that descended into the Capitol attack as well as with Trump campaign officials, say sources close to the inquiry.\n\nYet none of the text messages Meadows produced to the select committee through a cooperation deal agreed last year and in response to a subpoena show any such contacts, raising the specter that he might have deliberately withheld some communications.\n\nThe former White House chief of staff appears to have ultimately turned over no text messages between 9 December and 21 December, a critical time period in the lead-up to the Capitol attack during which a number of key moments took place.\n\nMeadows appeared to be aware of efforts by the White House and others, for instance, to send fake Trump slates of electors to Congress. The idea was to have “dueling” slates of electors force then-vice president Mike Pence to discount those votes and return Trump to office.\n\nThat scheme – which the select committee believes was coordinated in part by the Trump White House, the sources said – appeared to occur on 14 December, the deadline under the Electoral Count Act for states to send electoral college votes to Congress.\n\nMeadows also was in close contact with Trump’s attorney Rudy Giuliani and others after the contentious Oval Office meeting with Trump on 18 December, as he sought to bar onetime Trump campaign lawyer and conspiracy theorist Sidney Powell from the White House.\n\nBut Meadows appears to have turned over no text messages from that crucial period, as allies of the former president started to set their sights on January 6, including the Stop the Steal movement that started to plan a protest at the Capitol around that time.\n\nThe seeming omission may be explained in part by the fact that Meadows was communicating about those plans on his personal cell phone – against which the select committee issued a subpoena contested by Meadows in federal court as “overly broad”.\n\nThe absence of messages between 9 December and 21 December may also be explained more straightforwardly by the fact that Meadows did not receive any messages during that period. Meadows’ lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nHouse investigators are not convinced they have been given all the text messages relevant to their subpoena, according to one source with knowledge of the matter, and expect to continue pursuing Meadows’ documents and personal communications in court.\n\nIn a motion for summary judgment with respect to Meadows’ records, the select committee said in a 248-page court filing late on Friday that it believed Meadows’ claims for withholding material from the investigation on grounds of executive privilege were baseless.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfe079c4faec28229651078fa1ef1445f13623c9/0_149_4504_2704/master/4504.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bb0615f20d2d295d9c507d24a68b0912', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:54'}

The best ways of doing that are make sure people are vaccinated and boosted as the vice president is and making sure we have plenty of therapeutics.”\n\nMinutes after Harris announced her result, two Democratic members of the Senate — Ron Wyden of Oregon and Chris Murphy of Connecticut — announced they too had contracted what they believed to be mild forms of the virus.\n\n“It’s a bummer, but I’m sure if I wasn’t fully vaccinated I would be feeling a lot worse. So remember to get your booster!” Murphy tweeted.\n\nSimmons, Harris’ communications director, tested positive for the virus after attending the April 2 Gridiron dinner, a traditional white-tie gathering of reporters and politicians that features light roasts and songs.\n\nAtty.

Schiff (D-Burbank) and Joaquin Castro (D-Texas).\n\nAll of them had been vaccinated, and none became seriously ill.\n\nHarris’ positive tests come as the administration has tried to push the country toward normalcy, eliminating mask requirements in many settings and returning to public gatherings.

She returned from Los Angeles on Monday.\n\nAshish Jha, White House COVID-19 response coordinator, said that he is not privy to conversations about if Harris is receiving therapeutics in light of her positive test. He also cited the importance of vaccinations and therapeutics in dealing with the spread of the BA.2 variant.\n\n“If you take a step back and look at the vice president, she is boosted, actually twice boosted. We have a very, very contagious variant out there. It is going to be hard to ensure that no one gets COVID in America. That’s not even a policy goal. The goal of our policy should be, obviously minimize infection whenever possible but to make sure people don’t get seriously ill,” he said.\n\nHarris’s husband, Doug Emhoff, became the first member of the first and second couples to contract COVID-19. He tested positive on March 15, which lead to a flurry of questions over Harris’s contact and if she should be wearing a mask around the president and others.

The former House member, who is the first bisexual member of the Senate, 'joked with Democrats about how easy it was for her to charm Republican men,' according to the book.\n\n'Sinema, a fitness enthusiast who was 36 when she entered Congress, boasted knowingly to colleagues and aides that her cleavage had an extraordinary persuasive effect on the uptight men of the GOP. She told one House Republican that while she would never switch parties, her father would be delighted if she did,' the authors write.\n\nSen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) 'boasted knowingly to colleagues and aides that her cleavage had an extraordinary persuasive effect on the uptight men of the GOP,' according to a new book\n\nThe book also delves into President Joe Biden's governing woes – including prolonged talks with Sinema, whom the authors dub an 'aloof Arizonan.' She became a progressive nemesis when she and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) wouldn't go along with Biden's multi-trillion proposals, although she did cheer his infrastructure plan.\n\nAfter Biden signed the infrastructure bill, Sinema asked Biden's aides not to send the president to her home state for a 'victory lap,' even though he had won Arizona in 2020. White House aides were concluding she was 'simply a difficult person.'\n\nThe book describes one early 2021 dinner with Senate Republicans after the election where where the Republicans asked Sinema to join – and she requested to be able to enter through a back door to avoid being seen.\n\nShe has won praise from Republicans for her opposition to changing the Senate filibuster, and a line of Republicans congratulated her on the Senate floor after voting with the GOP on a move to advance the Democratic leadership backed voting rights legislation.\n\nThe book, which grabbed headlines with revelations about House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, also contains details about former President Donald Trump and his election overturn effort.\n\nSinema confounded Democrats during months-long negotiations\n\nSinema previously served in the House.

He had called the Capitol riot in a Jan. 6th column a 'disgrace,' where he wrote that 'one point of the riot was to further pressure Pence (“Hang Mike Pence!”), but much of the lobbying took place behind closed doors, among Trump’s advisers.')\n\nTrump also took a shot at now Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. 'It was beyond belief, Trump said, that Mitch McConnell did not seem to understand this,' according to the book.\n\n'The president's comments were pure madness,' the authors write.\n\nCongress ultimately counted the votes certified by the states following the Capitol riot.

Mo Brooks, Brooks released a statement saying Trump had approached him with the idea.\n\n'President Trump asked me to rescind the 2020 elections, immediately remove Joe Biden from the White House, immediately put President Trump back in the White House, and hold a new special election for the presidency,' Brooks said in a statement.\n\n'As a lawyer, I’ve repeatedly advised President Trump that January 6 was the final election contest verdict and neither the U.S. Constitution nor the U.S. Code permit what President Trump asks. Period,' he added.\n\n'I’ve told President Trump the truth knowing full well that it might cause President Trump to rescind his endorsement. But I took a sworn oath to defend and protect the U.S. Constitution. I honor my oath. That is the way I am. I break my sworn oath for no man.'\n\nTrump took back his endorsement in the Alabama Senate primary, citing Brooks' call for people to put the 2020 election 'behind you.'\n\nLindell, who was advised Trump inside the White House in the last days of his presidency, has also repeatedly touted the idea.\n\nOther passages in the book reveal how Vice President Kamala Harris quickly learned not to come between President Biden and his negotiations with Congress.\n\nThe authors recount one episode where the president snapped at her so harshly even Republican senators in the meeting were shocked.\n\nIn a meeting last May, Biden tried to persuade Republican lawmakers to support $1 trillion in infrastructure spending.\n\nAnd while Biden was ready for a compromise, Harris thought the bill was skimpy.\n\n'Harris thought that there was something missing from the conversation,' according to the book.\n\nShe began turning the conversation toward Democratic priorities, including family and social spending, which were originally included in the larger Build Back Better bill.\n\nShe 'began to make the case for a larger package than the one Republicans seemed to have in mind.'\n\n'Biden dismissed her comment immediately,' the authors wrote, in so harsh a tone 'that even the Republican senators were taken aback.'\n\nBiden was typically 'scrupulously respectful' of his second-in-command, but the moment revealed that infrastructure negotiations were his and his alone.", 'image': 'https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/26/17/57074033-0-image-a-35_1650989503049.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:57:00'}

After news of Musk’s takeover, news website Politico contacted several top Republican members and aides to gauge reaction to a potential Trump Twitter return.\n\n“Every single one of them told us that they hoped the former president stays the hell away from Twitter,” Politico reported.\n\nTrump himself has said he won’t be back, telling Fox News: “I am going to be staying on Truth.”\n\nThe twice-impeached former commander-in-chief is not known for his consistency, however. He has reportedly expressed discontent with how Truth Social has performed – “What the fuck is going on,” the Daily Beast reported Trump as asking aides in March – and to return to relevance, and to win back the spotlight he craves, the former president might need Twitter.\n\n“If he wants to intervene on behalf of a candidate he has now endorsed in the midterm elections, being able to reach that number of people with messages supporting those candidates is a way of essentially getting free advertising time to reach people who are more likely to vote as a result of getting a signal from Donald Trump,” Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, told Time.\n\nTrump may have insisted that he will snub Twitter and stick with Truth Social, but his commitment to his own platform has so far been tepid at best – Trump has posted on Truth Social just once.\n\nIf that lack of interaction hasn’t helped Truth Social, neither did the botched rollout on 21 February. Tens of thousands of people were unable to access the network – the Guardian was finally allowed in on 5 March – and by early April the Truth Social app was the 355th most popular on Apple devices.\n\nIn terms of daily active users, Truth Social had 513,000, the Daily Beast reported. Twitter has about 217 million.\n\nLack of usage – both by Trump and by the general public – is not the only problem the new network faces.\n\nShares in Digital World Acquisition Corporation, the firm which plans to merge with Trump Media & Technology Group, dropped 13% on Monday after news of Musk’s deal. Since Musk became the largest shareholder in Twitter TMTG shares have fallen by 44% overall, and two key Truth Social executives quit the platform in April.\n\nSince Trump was removed from Twitter his missives have been limited to email blasts sent from his Save America Pac, the messages frequently bleating about a “stolen election” in 2020. At the moment those emails are received by a mixture of supporters and vaguely interested journalists.\n\nIf Trump resumed tweeting, he’d have a far bigger audience for his misinformation – which could have serious consequences.\n\n“The real danger would come after election day,” Gertz said, “when he could use that same megaphone to spread lies about voter fraud as a pretext for overturning elections. If that happens, another January 6 – perhaps a more successful one – is very much in play.”', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a92109698abfe8cebc8ed79f918f6e0cb5a652cf/0_156_5131_3078/master/5131.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0c9734ab4bdc644afa8fecabe2eaf914', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:03'}

But obviously in the case where there’s perhaps a lot of controversy, you would not necessarily want to promote that tweet,” he said.\n\nPreviously, Musk has expressed alarm over Twitter’s content moderation policies, suggesting they’re tantamount to political censorship.\n\nIn recent years, Twitter has fielded criticism from conservatives and others who have said the company has engaged in censoring viewpoints that go against the mainstream.\n\nNotably, former President Donald Trump was suspended from the social media site after the Jan. 6 Capitol breach, coming as Twitter spokespeople claimed he was using the platform to incite violence, although it did not provide evidence for its claims.

Those measures aim to make the services more appealing to advertisers seeking a safe venue, and to better accommodate politicians and regulators arguing that the platforms are responsible for all of their content. But the moves have alienated some users who, like Mr. Musk, say they go overboard.\n\nHow Twitter operates won’t be entirely up to Mr. Musk.\n\n“Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules—regardless of their shareholding,” Thierry Breton, the EU regulator, wrote Tuesday on Twitter. “Mr Musk knows this well.”\n\nMr. Breton expressed confidence that Twitter, under Mr. Musk’s ownership, would conform to the bloc’s new rules, which still need formal approval from the EU Parliament and representatives from EU countries.\n\nMr. Musk’s planned changes at Twitter, and the response, will be closely watched. Twitter is smaller and less profitable than other social-media companies. It claims 217 million so-called monetizable daily users compared with 1.9 billion daily users for Meta Platforms Inc.’s core Facebook platform and a billion-plus monthly users for TikTok. But Twitter users include media personalities, politicians, activists and tech aficionados who help shape social discourse.\n\n“It has influence way beyond its user base and way beyond its valuation, and so we care about it,” said David Kaye, former United Nations special rapporteur focused on free speech and now a law professor at the University of California, Irvine.\n\nTwitter’s existing content policies haven’t brought about huge financial success; it has struggled to deliver consistent profits. Photo: Laura Morton for The Wall Street Journal\n\nMr. Musk, chief executive of Tesla Inc. and Space Exploration Technologies Corp. as well as the world’s richest person, is one of Twitter’s most prominent users, employing the platform for everything from promoting his companies to battling rivals and critics. In Monday’s deal announcement, he said he wants to open up Twitter’s algorithms to public scrutiny, “defeat” spammers and authenticate users’ identities.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Musk said he views “free speech” as that permitted by the law—a far broader definition of what is allowable than most major social networks have adopted. “I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law,” he said in a tweet. “If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect. Therefore, going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people.”\n\nSome industry executives and analysts say Mr. Musk is in for an awakening. Reversing Twitter’s efforts risks stoking advertisers’ worries about the placement of their ads, potentially pushing them toward competitors like Snap Inc. and Meta, said Ben Black, co-head of internet research at Deutsche Bank.\n\nElon Musk struck a deal on Monday to buy Twitter for about $44 billion, moving the world’s richest man a step closer to taking control of the social-media platform. Photo: Ryan Lash/TED Conferences, LLC/AFP via Getty Images\n\n“Do you really want to have your Mercedes-Benz commercial against a beheading?” he said. “If someone falls overboard on a cruise ship, do you want your vacation message being advertised against that content?” He said less moderation could also drive away some users, potentially slowing growth.\n\n“‘Do you really want to have your Mercedes-Benz commercial against a beheading?’” — Ben Black, co-head of internet research at Deutsche Bank\n\nIn the company’s early years, Twitter executives were loath to remove content unless it broke local laws. The platform often took a hands-off approach even to content from officially designated terrorist groups, drawing criticism from researchers, lawmakers and victims’ families.\n\nIt stepped up moderation over the years, removing accounts connected to the terrorist group ISIS in 2014, for example. That accelerated during and after the 2016 U.S. presidential race, which saw a jump in complaints about white nationalists and others using the platform to attack and harass minority users.\n\nOther industry leaders who favored looser policies, including Meta co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, have gradually embraced more intervention. Platforms including Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest Inc. and Reddit Inc. all have added staff or bolstered rules to monitor their content, though each draws the lines differently.\n\nTheir efforts target a range of potentially problematic content, from hate speech and false information about elections to what they see as fringe views on health, along with other issues the platforms consider harmful. Pinterest recently banned posts that it deems to contain misinformation about climate change.\n\nTwitter and other platforms also have systems allowing users to report claims of abuse by other users, which can lead to account suspensions that some of those involved say can be arbitrary or unfair.\n\nMore moderating has required complex, and often confusing, guidelines for employees and users. Such efforts have led to some divisive decisions, including bans by Twitter and Facebook of then-President Donald Trump for posts encouraging the rioters who attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, seeking to halt certification of President Biden’s electoral victory.\n\nThose bans were widely praised on the left and by some Republicans. But Mr. Trump and his supporters blasted it and have backed rival social-media apps with fewer restrictions that so far have gained limited traction, including Parler, Gab, and Gettr, which former Trump adviser Jason Miller launched last year.\n\nMany in the Trump camp have voiced support for Mr. Musk’s planned Twitter acquisition, though Mr. Trump told Fox News on Monday that he doesn’t plan to return to the platform and would instead use his social-media startup, Truth Social.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up Technology A weekly digest of tech reviews, headlines, columns and your questions answered by WSJ's Personal Tech gurus. PREVIEW\n\nDevin Nunes, CEO of Truth Social, lauded Monday’s Twitter deal, though he said he doesn’t see the platform, even under Mr. Musk, as a direct competitor because of their different target audiences. “This is a great, great day,” the Trump ally and former GOP congressman said. “Finally we’re getting some movement in the right direction here in terms of opening the internet back up and giving people their voice back.”\n\nTwitter’s existing policies haven’t brought about huge financial success; it has struggled to deliver consistent profits. And losing advertisers might not be a problem for Mr. Musk. He has said he wants the platform to rely less on advertising—which accounts for about 90% of its revenue, totaling $5.1 billion last year—and to focus more on a subscription business model. The platform currently offers Twitter Blue, a $2.99-a-month subscription service that gives customers access to premium features.\n\nDespite Mr. Trump’s comments Monday, many observers and Twitter employees are focused on Mr. Musk’s handling of the former president’s account as a potential indicator of his plans. During an all-hands meeting on Monday, Twitter CEO Parag Agarwal was asked if the company might reinstate Mr. Trump once Mr. Musk’s ownership is completed. Mr. Agarwal said it wasn’t clear.\n\n—Patience Haggin contributed to this article.\n\nElon Musk and Twitter More coverage of the billionaire's bid for Twitter, selected by editors Latest Developments\n\nWrite to Deepa Seetharaman at Deepa.Seetharaman@wsj.com and Meghan Bobrowsky at Meghan.Bobrowsky@wsj.com", 'image': 'https://images.wsj.net/im-531039/social', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:07'}

Given that neither received any Republican support during earlier procedural votes, the latest Covid absences scrambled the equation for Democrats.', 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/26/us/politics/26dc-harris/merlin_205209216_8283ca17-da2a-4f0a-a956-b00adce3f8b1-facebookJumbo.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:59'}

He said that the book describes how “populist economic nationalism has arrived as a movement and why we need to embrace it.”\n\nIn 2021, Navarro published the book “In Trump Time: A Journal of America’s Plague Year,” which was ranked as a top-10 bestseller by USA Today and has been a bestseller on Amazon. Navarro previously noted that more than 200,000 copies of “In Trump Time” had been pre-sold, according to distributors, before it was available to the public.\n\nHowever, “In Trump Time” was omitted from The New York Times’ non-fiction bestseller list even though it should have been ranked at least third on the list from Nov. 21, 2021, Navarro said at the time, citing statistics published by Bookscan, the definitive industry source used for book rankings.\n\n“The New York Times in its cancel culture, virtue signaling, fascist world, did not put it on the list,” Navarro told The Epoch Times. “And that had a material harm to the sales of the book because people use that New York Times bestseller list as what we call in economics a ‘signal’ as to whether a book is worthy of purchase. So there was a great grassroots performance by the book itself. But my judgment, if we weren’t in a cancel culture world, we probably would have sold a million copies of that book.”\n\nIn response to Navarro’s allegations, Nicole Taylor, a communications director at The New York Times, told The Epoch Times in an email that the publication’s best-seller lists are “based on a detailed analysis of book sales from a wide range of retailers who provide us with specific and confidential context of their sales each week.”\n\nThe New York Times representative added that “sales data from our confidential panel of reporting stores is separate from what is reported to Bookscan or other entities” and that publication’s “Best Sellers department has reviewed the data they received for the sales week of November 21, 2021 and is confident in the accuracy of the Best-Seller Lists for that week.”\n\nNavarro, in an email response, called The New York Times’ statement a “misdirection,” saying that “In Trump Time” sold over 30,000 books during the week in question. “We sold twice as many books or more as half of the titles that appeared on the list,” he said.\n\nThe former official announced “Taking Back Trump’s America,” which is scheduled for release in September, while guest-hosting Stephen K. Bannon’s “War Room” podcast on April 15, and said “hands down the ‘War Room’ is the most powerful platform to sell thoughtful books to the American public. It really astonishes people, authors, publishers, when they go on the road and see how lettered the audience is.”\n\n“I’m counting also on publications like The Epoch Times,” he said. “My hope is that avid readers of The Epoch Times will embrace ‘Taking Back Trump’s America.’”\n\nNavarro revealed that The Epoch Times will be included in the book, saying, “I talk about The Epoch Times in glowing terms in the ‘Taking Back Trump’s America’ book with respect to how it’s grown rapidly from what was a niche publication to one of the most important international newspapers in the world.”\n\nThe former official projected large gains for the Republicans in November’s midterms, driven by growing dissatisfaction with what he described as increasingly radical Democratic policies.\n\n“I think a safe bet is a 60-seat swing [in favor of the Republican Party], which is similar to what happened to Obama with the Tea Party [movement] and when [Newt] Gingrich came along [in the 1994 midterm elections], but depending on how redistricting goes around the country, that could go as high as 80 and as low as 30 or 40,” Navarro said.\n\n“I think a large portion of the country now is united against the Democrat Party,” he added, describing its performance as showing that “it’s a radical political party.”\n\n“It’s really out of touch in the center of this country.”\n\nDespite Republican Party advantages heading into the midterms, Navarro noted that there are struggles between globalists and nationalists happening within the party.\n\n“It’s also true that there’s an important war going on now within the Republican Party between the party of Davos, Wall Street, multinational corporations that offshore our jobs versus the Trump Republicans who embrace secure borders, embrace fair rather than simply so-called free trade,” he said. “If we simply have a Republican majority with the current leadership in charge, Mitch McConnell in the Senate, Kevin McCarthy in the House, we’re going to have basically the status quo ante, and it will not serve the center of this country.”\n\nNavarro emphasized the distinction between “RINO,” an acronym for “Republican in Name Only,” and “Trump” Republicans.\n\n“The Karl Rove faction, the Wall Street faction, the Liz Cheney faction … Mitch McConnell, [Kevin] McCarthy, they’re all supporting RINO Republicans rather than Trump Republicans,” he said, adding that the Republican primaries will serve as a critical test to determine which camp prevails.\n\nA primary race that Navarro is particularly interested in is the Republican primary race in South Carolina’s 1st Congressional District between Trump-endorsed Katie Arrington and first-term incumbent Nancy Mace. Following the events of Jan. 6, 2021, and in what was her first speech on the floor of the House of Representatives, Mace, who had worked on the 2016 Trump campaign, blamed the president for the breach of the Capitol. A story was also posted to her official Congressional website that included “Mace Condemns President Trump” in the headline.\n\nMace is a poster child for the RINO, Rove, corporate media effort to stop the Trump movement,” Navarro told The Epoch Times. Trump endorsed primary challenger Katie Arrington in February, calling Mace “an absolutely terrible candidate” who “has been very disloyal to the Republican Party.”\n\nWhen reached for comment, Austin McCubbin, manager for Rep. Mace’s congressional campaign wrote in an e-mailed statement, “Conservative organizations all score Mace as having a near perfect voting record, because she doesn’t sacrifice her principles.”\n\nNavarro, in response, said in an email, “I was in the trenches with Katie Arrington in the Trump administration when we were fighting to save millions of lives at the start of the pandemic and she was a warrior.”\n\n“The only thing you need to know about Mace is she supported the Democrats effort to steal the election from Donald Trump,” he added.\n\nExecutive Privilege\n\nNavarro described how he is protecting executive privilege in the face of intense pressure from the Democrat-majority House committee investigating the events of Jan. 6.\n\nThe Trump aide refused to comply with a subpoena from the House committee, citing executive privilege. In a highly partisan vote this month, the House of Representatives voted to formally ask the Justice Department to prosecute Navarro and another top Trump adviser on criminal contempt charges for not complying with the subpoena.\n\nAfter the November 2020 presidential election when Trump and allies, including Navarro, alleged largescale election irregularities and fraud, Navarro coordinated what he calls the “Green Bay Sweep” strategy with Trump and Stephen Bannon, who previously served as Trump’s chief White House strategist. The Green Bay Sweep Strategy, named after a football play made famous by the Green Bay Packers, involved members of Congress formally contesting election results in six battleground states before the certification of presidential election results on Jan. 6.\n\nNavarro writes in his book “In Trump Time” regarding Jan. 6, “The political and legal beauty of the strategy was this: by law, both the House of Representatives and the Senate must spend up to two hours of debate per state on each requested challenge. For the six battleground states, that would add up to as much as twenty-four hours of nationally televised hearings across the two chambers of Congress. Through these televised proceedings, we would finally be able to short-circuit the crushing censorship of the anti-Trump media and take our case directly to the American people.”\n\nHe also writes of the event, “The goal is not to get the election overturned today. The goal is to subject the ballots—the legal votes of American citizens along with what we believe to be a flood of illegal ballots—to careful scrutiny and investigation.”\n\nNavarro explained his reasons for maintaining privilege during the House committee proceedings, and suggested that the matter may ultimately have to be resolved by the Supreme Court.\n\n“President Trump has asserted executive privilege, number one,” Navarro told The Epoch Times. “Number two, I informed the [House January 6] committee very clearly that it was not my privilege to waive, therefore I could not comply with their subpoena. And I directed them—and this is equally important—I directed them to negotiate directly with [Trump] and his attorneys for any partial or full waiver of the privilege, and then I would be happy to comply if President Trump himself or his attorneys negotiated something with them. It’s not my privilege to waive.”\n\nHe added, “Subsequent to that, the committee colluded either explicitly or tacitly with the Biden White House to do an end run around that direction, and they chose to have Biden take the legal step of waiving President Trump’s privilege in this matter. And that’s where things stand. So, there’s going to be ongoing legal activities related to that … But this is a Supreme Court decision waiting to happen, because the [House Jan. 6] committee itself is acting in an illegal manner.”\n\nThe White House and the House Jan. 6 committee did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nNavarro in late 2020 completed a report, “The Navarro Report,” documenting detailed evidence and statistical receipts of widespread election fraud and irregularities in the 2020 presidential election. He noted this report has never been discredited, despite Democrats and others maintaining that there was no election fraud.\n\n“The central premise of the Jan. 6 committee is that the election was fair. And they simply assert that there was no fraud or irregularities,” Navarro said. “The problem with that is that there is abundant evidence to the contrary, starting with a very extensive and extensively referenced three-volume report I did that explains what that fraud and what those irregularities were, and how and why the Democrats were able to pull off essentially what was a stolen election.”\n\nNavarro also pointed to corporate media turning a blind eye to the Navarro Report and the substantial evidence of fraud in the 2020 presidential election that it details.\n\n“Just as the corporate media ignored purposefully the “In Trump Time” book, which arguably is the best history to date of the Trump White House, they have ignored any reference to the three-volume Navarro Report … The report’s been out there well prior to January 6, and nobody has ever discredited it.”\n\nDefending Against China\n\nThe former official described the Biden administration’s handling of its relationship with the Chinese regime as “total appeasement.”\n\n“I’m very, very concerned that the weakness that Biden showed Putin has resulted in the invasion of Ukraine. The weakness that Biden is showing Xi Jinping may result in an invasion of Taiwan,” he said.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nNavarro, who has authored books including “The Coming China Wars,” “Death By China,” and “Crouching Tiger: What China’s Militarism Means for the World,” is known for his strong defense of the United States against totalitarian China’s aggression, and was one of the chief architects of the Trump administration’s tough trade policies with respect to Beijing. Trump slapped nearly $360 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods during his presidency.\n\nIn the Trump White House, Navarro identified the Chinese Communist Party’s “seven deadly sins” of economic aggression, including cyber hacking to steal trade secrets, intellectual property theft, forced technology transfer, below-cost dumping of products into American markets, the use of heavily subsidized state-owned enterprises that employ predatory pricing, currency manipulation, and the flooding of American communities with fentanyl and other opioids.\n\nWhen asked about what the United States should do now to continue to defend against totalitarian China’s aggression, Navarro stated, “We were ready in a second [Trump administration] term to really up the tariffs.”\n\nHe continued, “I think something that would be a perfect complement to tariffs would be a complete cutting off of capital flows from America to China. It’s crazy that our pension funds, for example, are supporting companies in China that make weapons, for example. We tried to stop that.”\n\nIn November 2020, Trump issued an executive order prohibiting purchases by American investors of stocks in companies determined by the US Defense Department to be owned or controlled by the Chinese military. In June 2021, the Biden administration replaced this order with a revised version that in some ways expanded upon the original, including by widening the scope of Chinese companies that could be sanctioned.\n\nNavarro said that “China is an existential threat to the country,” and added, “My view is and has long been that we should stop doing any kind of business with them until they cease their economic aggressions. Geopolitical, revanchist, and imperialist aggression.”\n\nPointing to the need for America to show strength in the face of totalitarian China’s continuing and intensifying aggression, Navarro said, “Strength invites peace, weakness invites war.”', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2021/01/28/CPAC_2019_9A6A5372-1-1200x800.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:57'}

But when it became a cesspit of hate and harassment for women and people of color in particular, it began to offer a miserable bargain: You can be free to say what you wish, but your life can be made unrelentingly painful if you so dare.\n\nThe “censorship” that Mr. Musk performatively deplores consists of efforts to rectify these very real problems of harassment and abuse. Twitter has taken modest but wildly inadequate steps to improve safety on the platform. It has acknowledged it has a problem. It has recognized positive freedom of speech — the creation of a safe and non-life-ruining environment for the airing of thoughts. And it is this that Mr. Musk and his ilk seem to loathe.\n\nThis is why his deal to purchase Twitter is so dangerous. In recent years, there has been progress toward positive freedom of speech — real work to give everyone, truly everyone, more meaningful occasion to speak. Mr. Musk apparently wants to shut that down. Instead, in a moment of proto-fascism on the political right, his priority seems to be to undam the flood of bile and bigotry and bullying and disinformation.\n\nThe country already faces the very real prospect, starting at noon on Jan. 20, 2025, of a descent toward racist authoritarianism and a protracted slide away from liberal democracy. If your idea of what the country needs in this moment is less clamping down on hate and lies and more rightists gone wild, whew.\n\nThe plutocrats have already rigged the economy. That’s just the first step. Then you take some of the spoils and reinvest it in buying even more political influence, so that political inequality can help keep economic inequality yawning. You buy up media or social media platforms and thus can help rig the discourse in your favor, taking control of the tools used by regular people to fight back. You venture, as Mr. Musk did, to a TED conference and, without much pushback, brand yourself as a kind of public intellectual, a thought leader, a visionary, and thereby in many people’s minds you became a sage, not a robber baron.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be this way. We can have nice things. But we’re going to have to learn to see through the fraudulent stories that elevate figures like Mr. Musk into heroes. We’re going to have to legislate real guardrails — perhaps like those created by the European Union’s Digital Services Act — on social media platforms that are too big to entrust democracy to. We’re going to have to build nonprofit alternatives to the platforms and see if they can become meaningful venues.', 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/26/opinion/26giridharadas_2/26giridharadas_2-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:56'}

Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency created as a 'joke' in 2013. Its mascot is a Shiba Inu dog, made popular from the 'doge' meme featuring photos of the canine overlaid with text written in broken English. It can be bought or sold on crypto exchanges like Coinbase or on trading apps like Robinhood and Webull. One Dogecoin is worth 16 cents as of Tuesday morning. It's never been worth more than 64 cents. Creator Billy Markus said last year that he invented the coin as a joke.

It feels silly, but there's this huge upwelling behind it.'

Co-founder Jack Dorsey (right) holds a board seat, but is expected to give it up in May\n\nMusk is known for using Twitter to post inflammatory messages, much like former President Donald Trump.\n\nParag Agrawal, the CEO, said on Monday that it was up to Musk to decide whether to readmit Trump.\n\nTrump on Monday said he would not be rejoining the site if Musk allowed him to - instead saying he would continue to use his own TRUTH Social.\n\nSome experts are pointing to a tough road ahead for Twitter if Musk, who calls himself a free speech absolutist, gets his way.\n\n'We expect advertisers will be less willing to spend on Twitter if Elon Musk removes content moderation in order to promote free speech,' MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson said.\n\nThe 16-year old company, which has emerged as one of the world's most influential online public squares with about over 200 million users, reported $4.51 billion in ad revenue for 2021, accounting for about 89% of its overall sales.\n\n'The challenge (for Twitter) will be maintaining and building revenue given that the controversial opinions (Musk) hopes to give more of a free rein to are often unpalatable to advertisers,' Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Susannah Streeter said.\n\nTesla tycoon versus Big Tech: How swashbuckling billionaire Elon Musk fought off 'poison pill', lawsuits and hostile board of directors before $44bn Twitter takeover\n\nIt has been one of the most dramatic takeover attempts in history, seeing a swashbuckling billionaire pitted against one of the largest tech giants in the world.\n\nBut Elon Musk's seizing of Twitter has been a months-long pursuit that has seen him send shockwaves through the world of business.\n\nThe Tesla magnate started hoarding shares in the social media firm at the start of the year in an apparent bid to preserve free speech online.\n\nHe quickly rocketed to the top of its shareholders' list, acquiring a huge 9% stake in the tech giant.\n\nBut then he hit choppy waters, accepting a place on the board then rejecting it, getting embroiled in lawsuits and seeing rival companies circle to buy Twitter.\n\nMeanwhile bosses at the social media firm appeared to do all they could to ensure he could not not seize it - even launching a 'poison pill' strategy to sink his chances.\n\nYet Musk brazenly blasted through all the obstacles, punting a $43 billion offer earlier this month and showing how he would finance it.\n\nThe two sides were reportedly working into the early morning on Monday to finalize the 'fast-moving' negotiations.\n\nIt saw Twitter shares in the US soar by four percent as the markets opened to $50.84 a share.\n\nOn Monday, Musk called for his 'worst critics' to remain on the platform because 'that is what free speech means'.\n\nHere, DailyMail.com looks at the rollercoaster journey he has been on over the last few months as he seizes his prize.\n\n\n\nThe Tesla magnate started hoarding shares in the social media firm at the start of the year in an apparent bid to preserve free speech online\n\nJanuary 31: Musk hoards Twitter shares and buys them 'almost daily'\n\nMusk started buying Twitter stock on January 31 and continued to buy shares during every trading session through April 1, according to an SEC filing.\n\nJust days earlier, he told his 80 million followers on the site he was ' giving serious thought ' to creating his own social media platform.\n\nA user asked him: 'Would you consider building a new social media platform, @elonmusk?\n\n'One that would consist an open source algorithm, one where free speech and adhering to free speech is given top priority, one where propaganda is very minimal. I think that kind of a platform is needed.'\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO replied through his official account: 'Am giving serious thought to this.'\n\nThe billionaire businessman, 50, appeared to be suggesting he was sick of Twitter over the right to freedom of speech.\n\nApril 4: Musk says he bought 9.2 percent stake in firm a month earlier\n\nMusk revealed he had purchased a 9.2 percent stake in the social media giant on March 14.\n\nHe tweeted 'oh hi lol' after the news sent shockwaves through the business world and across social media. He added: 'Do you want an edit button?'\n\nApril 5: He joins Twitter's board of directors - sees share price rocket\n\nTwitter said the tech tycoon was joining the company's board of directors, causing the social media platform's shares to rise over 7 per cent in premarket trading.\n\nIt led to speculation he would try to address what he called the platform's 'failure to adhere to free speech principles' and 'fundamentally undermine democracy'.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Musk would have served on the board until the company's 2024 annual shareholders meeting.\n\nAs long as he remains a director, the agreement said, he could not won more than 14.9 percent of the company's stock.\n\nIt meant he would not have been able to take over the company until well after his term on the board was over.\n\nThe firm said: 'Twitter is committed to impartiality in the development and enforcement of its policies and rules.\n\n'Our policy decisions are not determined by the Board or shareholders, and we have no plans to reverse any policy decisions.'\n\n'As always our Board plays an important advisory and feedback role across the entirety of our service.\n\n'Our day to day operations and decisions are made by Twitter management and employees.'\n\nApril 8: Asset managers take over Musk as largest shareholders\n\nAsset manager Vanguard Group increased its stake to overtake Musk as the largest shareholder.\n\nVanguard owned 10.3 percent of Twitter, while the Tesla tycoon owned 9.1 per cent, making him the largest individual shareholder.\n\nVanguard, led by CEO Tim Buckley, increased its stake in the company at some point during the first quarter, according to SEC filings made on April 8.\n\nIt previously reported owning 67.2million shares of Twitter or about 8.4 per cent of the company as of the end of December, according to FactSet.\n\nOther owners of large quantities of Twitter stock included Morgan Stanley, Fidelity and Black Rock.\n\nVanguard, led by CEO Tim Buckley, increased its stake in the company at some point during the first quarter, according to SEC filings made on April 8\n\nApril 9: Musk rejects the offer to join Twitter's board of directors\n\nMusk rejected an offer to join Twitter's board after disclosing his stake in the company.\n\nAnalysts said the move signaled his intention to take over the company as a board seat would have limited his stake to just under 15 per cent.\n\nParag Agrawal said the board would still 'remain open' to Musk's input, but warned: 'There will be distractions ahead but our goals and priorities remain unchanged.'\n\nHe said: 'The board and I had many discussions about Elon joining the board, and with Elon directly. We were excited to collaborate and clear about the risks.\n\n'We also believed that having Elon as a fiduciary of the company where he, like all board members, has to act in the best interests of the company and all our shareholders, was the best path forward. The board offered him a seat.'\n\nAgrawal continued: 'We announced on Tuesday that Elon would be appointed to the board contingent on a background check and formal acceptance.\n\n'Elon's appointment to the board was to become officially effective 4/9, but Elon shared that same morning that he will no longer be joining the board.'\n\nParag Agrawal said the board would still 'remain open' to Musk's input, but warned: 'There will be distractions ahead but our goals and priorities remain unchanged'\n\nApril 12: Twitter shareholder Marc Bain Rasella files suit against Musk\n\nMarc Bain Rasella filed a lawsuit against Musk for alleged securities fraud at a Manhattan federal court, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nThe suit claimed the billionaire was required to disclose his holdings to the SEC by March 24, but the delay kept Twitter's share price down allowing Musk to buy more.\n\nMusk was accused of violating a regulatory deadline to reveal he had accumulated a stake of at least five per cent.\n\nInstead, according to the complaint, Musk did not disclose his position in Twitter until he had almost doubled his stake to more than nine per cent.\n\nThat strategy, the lawsuit alleges, hurt less wealthy investors who sold shares in the company in the nearly two weeks before Musk acknowledged holding a major stake.\n\nApril 14: The Tesla tycoon offers to buy Twitter for $43 BILLION\n\nMusk offered to buy Twitter for $43billion, a regulatory filing showed, as he moved to seize the social media giant.\n\nMusk's offer price of $54.20 per share represented a 38 per cent premium to the closing price of Twitter's stock on April 1.\n\nThis was the last trading day before the Tesla CEO's over nine per cent investment in the company was publicly announced.\n\nIt even appeared to reference marijuana - also known as 420 - a common reference used by Musk on Twitter.\n\nTwitter said in a regulatory filing Musk provided a letter containing a proposal to buy the remaining shares of Twitter he did not already own.\n\nApril 15: Twitter launches 'poison pill' strategy to stop Musk buyout\n\nTwitter's board announced a dramatic poison pill plan to prevent Musk from increasing his stake in the company.\n\nAlso known as a shareholder rights provision, the plan would trigger a dilution of shares if any shareholder builds up a 15 per cent stake without the board's approval.\n\nThe plan did not prevent Twitter from accepting Musk's offer or entering negotiations with him or other potential buyers.\n\nBut it did stop the billionaire from putting pressure on the board by buying up ever more shares on the open market.\n\nMusk hit back with a laughing emoji to a version of the classic 'Distracted Boyfriend' meme mocking Twitter's board.\n\nThe imaged depicted 'Twitter's board' looking wistfully at the option to 'keep that easy gig that gives me shares' as 'Twitter investors' look on with disgust.\n\nTwitter's board is led by chairman Bret Taylor, who is also the co-CEO of business software giant Salesforce\n\nApril 16: Musk tweets Love Me Tender in tease of hostile takeover\n\nMusk tweeted 'Love Me Tender' as he again teased at the possibility of a hostile takeover of Twitter.\n\nThe billionaire posted the Elvis Presley lyrics in a potential bid to lure shareholders with a tender offer that could see him seize control.\n\nA tender offer would see him bypass the board and go to shareholders with his offer of $54.20 a share - but he would need to show how he would finance his bid.\n\nHe also appeared to suggest he would strip board members of their salaries, saying they would get '$0 if my bid succeeds'.\n\nApril 18: Jack Dorsey slams the Twitter board for 'plots and coups'\n\nJack Dorsey slammed the board of Twitter as he weighed into the toxic fight over Elon Musk's attempted hostile takeover for the first time.\n\nThe former CEO, who is still a member of the board himself, blasted the 'plots and coups' that were 'consistently the dysfunction of the company'.\n\nIn a series of bombshell tweets and replies, he endorsed one posting saying that 'a bad board will kill a company every time'.\n\nReplying to one post, he said: 'When I was fired in 2008 and made chair, the board took most of my shares away from me.\n\n'I also gave 1 per cent of the company back to the employee pool in 2015. So, ended up with very little of company.'\n\nHe also replied to one comment mentioning 'plots and coups' in the Twitter board saying: 'it's consistently been the dysfunction of the company'.\n\nEarlier in the thread, he replied to a post quoting a 'Silicon Valley proverb' by venture capitalist Fred Destin.\n\nIt said: 'Good boards don't create good companies, but a bad board will kill a company every time.' Dorsey said: 'Big facts.'\n\nFormer CEO Dorsey slammed Twitter's board of directors on as he replied to a series of unfriendly tweets\n\nApril 21: SpaceX boss unveils his $46.5billion financing package\n\nElon Musk unveiled his $46.5billion financing package to fund his takeover of Twitter - using Tesla as collateral.\n\nThe world's richest man filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission outlining how he would seize the social media giant.\n\nHe committed $21billion in equity, $13billion from Morgan Stanley in debt facilities and another $12.5billion from the bank and others in margin loans.\n\nBut 'a portion' of his shares in Tesla have been put forward as collateral, which analysts feared could have a huge impact on the firm.\n\nThe 50-year-old billionaire also revealed he was weighing up launching a tender offer for Twitter after the company ignored his acquisition offer.\n\nHe said he was exploring getting stocks directly from shareholders but admitted he 'has not determined whether to do so at this time'.\n\nMusk filed the document with the SEC showing how he planned to take over Twitter for about $46.5billion.\n\nHe secured a debt commitment letter from Morgan Stanley Senior Funding to the tune of $13billion in financing.\n\nThis was made up of a loan of $6.5billion, a senior secured revolving facility for $500million, a bridge loan of up to $3billion and an unsecured bridge loan for up to $3billion.\n\nHe also got a margin loan commitment letter from Morgan Stanley for $12.5 billion in margin loans. And Musk also got $21billion through equity financing.\n\nBut he has used 'a portion' of his shares in Tesla as collateral in the high-stakes move, which analysts warned could have huge ramifications for the company.\n\nApril 22: Musk posts 'boner' killer picture of Bill Gates on Twitter\n\nMusk dissed Bill Gates' gut on Twitter, posting a photo of the Microsoft mogul next to Apple's controversial pregnant man emoji 'in case you need to lose a boner.'\n\nHe posted a follow-up image in response to the Friday post of six hooded figured captioned 'shadow ban council reviewing Tweet'.\n\nThe joke could further infuriate woke Twitter staffers angered by Musk's ongoing bid to buy the firm after saying he would support free speech.\n\nThat is because the pregnant man emoji is aimed at being inclusive to transgender people - with Musk frequently taking aim at what he sees as woke overreach.\n\nApril 25: Musk finalizes deal to buy Twitter\n\nMusk was closing in on seizing Twitter as talks between the Tesla magnate and the tech giant entered their final stages, reports say.\n\nThe tycoon's representatives were said to be hammering out terms including a timeline and fees if an agreement was signed and then fell apart.\n\nThe two sides were reportedly working into the early morning to finalize the 'fluid and fast-moving' negotiations.\n\nTwitter shares soared by four percent as the markets opened to $50.84 a share amid reports it would be seized by Musk.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Twitter announced it had 'entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by an entity wholly owned by Elon Musk, for $54.20 per share in cash in a transaction valued at approximately $44 billion. Upon completion of the transaction, Twitter will become a privately held company.'", 'image': 'https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/26/14/57069119-0-image-a-49_1650980561815.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:46'}

Now the pills are no longer scarce, but they still aren\'t getting to everyone who might benefit from treatment.\n\n"It\'s pretty clear from the uptake of Paxlovid, and the rate of hospitalizations and deaths over the months that Paxlovid has been available, that there are still some folks who could have benefited from these medications," an administration official told reporters on Monday in a briefing to preview the announcement.\n\nFederal officials have voiced concerns publicly for weeks that treatments like Paxlovid, Merck and Ridgeback\'s Lagevrio antiviral pills, and Eli Lilly\'s bebtelovimab monoclonal antibody drug were not reaching enough Americans.\n\nOfficials said Monday that reported use of the antiviral pills has more than doubled over the past month, from 22,000 courses a week to over 55,000. That comes as cases and hospitalizations have begun to climb nationwide, driven by the highly-contagious Omicron BA.2 subvariant.\n\nIn New England, federal data has tracked the pace of new COVID-19 hospitalizations surging among patients 70 and older — the age group most vulnerable to severe COVID-19 — since the beginning of April. The rate of new admissions is now higher than the peak reached over the Delta variant wave last year, but remains a fraction of the record highs during the winter Omicron wave.\n\n"We certainly know that there\'s more room to go. We can save more lives by giving this medication to more people," said the official.\n\nGetting Paxlovid antiviral pills\n\nPaxlovid treatment needs to begin within a few days of first developing symptoms.\n\nA course of treatment is made up of three tablets that are taken twice a day, in the morning and evening, over the course of five days, for a total of 30 pills. Initial clinical trials showed the drug reduced the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization or death by 88%, compared to placebo.\n\nPaxlovid cannot be taken at the same time as several medications that can reduce the drug\'s efficacy or lead to potentially fatal side effects.\n\nThrough outreach to doctors and patients, officials say they hope more eligible Americans will act quickly to get the now-plentiful antiviral pills sitting on pharmacy shelves.\n\nPfizer\'s COVID-19 drug Paxlovid Fabian Sommer/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\n"A lot of providers early on in that scarcity mindset, when there were fewer courses available across the country, were really reserving this for only the folks who they thought would be the sickest of the sick," an administration official told reporters.\n\nOn Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health alert urging doctors to step up prescribing of effective COVID-19 treatments — and imploring at-risk patients who test positive not to delay in contacting their doctors, "even if your symptoms are mild."\n\nA "tranche" of more than 100,000 courses of the antiviral pills will be made available to all of the federal government\'s pharmacy partners to order directly, instead of through federal and local allocations. Officials say they expect the move will raise the number of sites with drugs in stock from 20,000 to 30,000.\n\nThat comes on top of efforts like the administration\'s nationwide "test-to-treat initiative" launched at thousands of pharmacies earlier this year.\n\nFollowing concerns that the program was inaccessible to Americans living in many parts of the country, officials said the administration is planning to launch new "federally-supported Test-to-Treat sites" beyond the 2,200 locations currently in the program.\n\n"I think we\'re going to be working really closely with these new federally supported sites, work directly with state, territorial, and jurisdictional leadership to identify the places that need more support," said an administration official.\n\nChallenges and questions\n\nOfficials acknowledged that the new moves do not address some of the criticisms levied against the Biden administration\'s treatment effort.\n\nDespite objections from pharmacy trade groups, the FDA excludes most pharmacists from being able to prescribe Paxlovid or Lagevrio. For at-risk Americans without access to a "test-to-treat" drugstore that has a qualifying provider available, this means some will have to make multiple trips to get the pills.\n\n"You have to develop COVID symptoms, you have to subsequently get a test for COVID-19, get the result of that test, find and go to see a provider, get a prescription, and then fill that prescription. That\'s six steps in five days," said an official.\n\nIt also does not include an expansion to who is eligible to take the drugs under the FDA\'s emergency use authorization.\n\nSpeaking at Uniformed Services University earlier this month, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the president\'s chief medical adviser, hinted that Paxlovid might soon be expanded to lower-risk patients "in order to prevent them possibly from getting long COVID."\n\nBoth Pfizer and Merck have also been running a range of trials that might support expanding use of the antiviral pills to more people. Results could come soon from a trial assessing Paxlovid in people who are exposed to the disease, but have not yet developed symptoms, which was due to be completed earlier this month.\n\nAnd administration officials at the briefing did not bring up growing reports of "rebound" or "relapse" symptoms — people who appear to recover from COVID-19 after taking the antiviral pills, but later get a new round of symptoms — which might lead to SARS-CoV-2 evolving resistance to the treatments.\n\nA spokesperson for Pfizer said the company was continuing to monitor data from their clinical trials of Paxlovid as well as real-world evidence, and has "not seen any resistance" to the drug.\n\nIn a statement, an FDA spokesperson acknowledged that reports of rebound "are important to evaluate further," but reiterated that the drug appeared 88% effective at reducing the risk of hospitalization or death in its clinical trial.\n\n"The FDA is evaluating the reports of viral load rebound after completing Paxlovid treatment and will share recommendations if appropriate," said the FDA\'s Chanapa Tantibanchachai.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/04/26/75834f94-0c35-4873-8166-5e4b24cfa0d3/thumbnail/1200x630/5625e6265f72e4689718b2845b0511c4/gettyimages-1238865166.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:22'}

Supply of the regimen was initially very limited, but as Covid-19 cases across the country have fallen and manufacturing has increased, it is now far more abundant. The White House is now moving to raise awareness of the pill and its availability, as well as making it easier to access.\n\nThe White House said Tuesday it is increasingly reaching out to doctors and announced that the drug will now be shipped directly to pharmacies, in addition to existing distribution channels run by states. That is expected to increase the number of sites from 20,000 to more than 30,000 next week and eventually to 40,000 locations.\n\nHowever, according to a senior Biden administration official speaking anonymously to Axios, many states are ordering just two-thirds of what is available to them and are using half their orders.\n\nProviders are probably limiting access to the pill because “we’ve had the experience in this pandemic before of operating in a scarcity mindset,” another administration official said in a press conference.\n\nMany states have opted for a lottery system to allocate Paxlovid and other Covid-19 drugs, often choosing to distribute the drugs to retail pharmacies instead of hospitals and clinics.\n\nAccording to Dr Douglas White, a University of Pittsburgh critical care doctor who helped design Pennsylvania’s lottery system for Covid-19 drug allocation, the system ends up favoring people who are not only aware of the drugs but have access to doctors to prescribe it and the ability to locate pharmacies that have them in stock.\n\n“The wealthy and well-connected will win the race,” White told the Los Angeles Times. It’s “the poster child for an unfair system.”\n\nDespite the administration’s attempt to reassure providers that there are enough pills for patients, in an interview with NPR on Monday, the White House’s Covid-19 response coordinator, Dr Ashish Jha, said that there are only enough pills “for the short run.” As of Tuesday, the US had ordered enough supply of the pills for 20 million people, which is estimated to last for several more months.\n\n“Right now, we’ve done a really good job of acquiring pills,” Jha said, adding that the Biden administration will need additional funding from Congress to acquire more pills. “We have to make sure that this is more than a short-term solution.”\n\nJha warned that the US will be running out of money for Paxlovid “reasonably soon,” and that “we actually aren’t even going to be able to pay our bills for what we’ve already entered into a contract with Pfizer for, so that’s going to be a problem.”\n\nThe Biden administration is expected to renew its request to Congress for $22bn in Covid-19 funding.\n\nPaxlovid, when administered within five days of symptoms appearing, has been proven to bring about a 90% reduction in hospitalizations and deaths among patients most likely to get severe disease. About 350 Americans are now dying each day from Covid-19, down from more than 2,600 during the height of the Omicron wave earlier this year.\n\nThe FDA authorized Pfizer’s drug for emergency use in adults and children age 12 or older with a positive Covid-19 test and early symptoms who face the highest risk of severe outcomes. That includes older people and those with conditions like obesity and heart disease, though the drug is not recommended for patients with severe kidney or liver problems.\n\nThe administration is also working to expand the number of “test-to-treat” sites that provide a one-stop shop for those with Covid-19 to get tested for the virus, consult with a medical professional if they’re positive and fill a prescription for Paxlovid on site.\n\nThere are now 2,200 such locations nationwide, though the administration hopes more sites come online in the next several weeks with support from the Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and pharmacy companies.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ec9f8e72eff2d14c7cbb28bd8af41604fea72e5/0_301_5075_3047/master/5075.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=269eeb032fb24072e4c2185b17d3cc66', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:54'}

TWTR -3.91% will need to follow the bloc’s new rules for tackling illegal and harmful content online if it wants to keep operating there, marking a possible challenge to Elon Musk’s plans to take a more hands-off approach to content moderation.\n\nThierry Breton, EU internal market commissioner, said Tuesday in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that it’s his job to make sure companies, including Twitter, understand their obligations in Europe. That will soon include a series of new obligations for social media and other online platforms, called the Digital Services Act, after lawmakers agreed to the main points of the legislation last week.\n\n“Now we have very clear rules,” Mr. Breton said. “They can do whatever they want outside of Europe…but in Europe they will just have to fulfill [our] rules and obligations.”\n\nThe Digital Services Act aims to force platforms to take more responsibility for the content their users post online. It will introduce a series of obligations for large social-media networks like Twitter, ranging from new standards for taking down illegal content to a requirement to conduct annual risk assessments detailing how they are responding to harmful content that is posted online.\n\nTwitter will become a private company if Elon Musk’s $44 billion takeover bid is approved. The move would allow Musk to make changes to the site. WSJ’s Dan Gallagher explains Musk’s proposed changes and the challenges he might face enacting them.

He is familiar with European rules on automotive, and will quickly adapt to the Digital Services Act.”\n\nMr. Musk’s purchase of Twitter could mark an eventual test case for the EU’s new legislation once it comes into effect, said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond. While there are questions about whether the European Commission will have the resources to fully enforce the new law, Prof. Tobias said, “I do think [Mr. Musk] is on notice, and Twitter shareholders, too.”\n\nMr. Musk wrote on Twitter Tuesday afternoon that his view of free speech is speech that “matches the law.”\n\n“I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law,” he said. “If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect.”\n\nMr. Breton said the EU was careful in setting its regulations to maintain freedom of speech. He said he had interactions with many platforms during the lawmaking process and was open to meeting with others, in a comment that appeared to be aimed at Mr. Musk. “If any new shareholder of these platforms is willing to engage with me, my door will be totally open, like always,” he said.\n\nThe EU’s new legislation won’t prevent Mr. Musk from taking a more free-speech-oriented approach, said Zach Meyers, a senior research fellow with the Centre for European Reform think tank.

In the wake of this "great deplatforming," Republicans\' longstanding gripes with these platforms became a legislative priority.\n\nOne of the most aggressive of these Republican-led efforts to regulate social media is Texas\' H.B. 20. Ostensibly passed to combat the "dangerous movement by social media companies to silence conservative viewpoints and ideas," this bill prohibits social media platforms from removing users or content "based on the viewpoint" of the user or content. In its effort to protect conservative speech, Texas Republicans have adopted a historically discredited left-wing legal theory, dispensing with core conservative values in the process.\n\nIn the 1960s, a group of progressive scholars argued that the First Amendment does not merely prohibit the government from censoring private speech and press. In fact, they argued, it granted the government the affirmative power to control the mass media. In a capitalist system, they reasoned, the government must ensure that private media owners do not exclude unwelcome viewpoints, in order to protect the "democratic interest" in free speech. To this end, the scholars championed the Fairness Doctrine, right-of-reply mandates, and expansive applications of "common carriage" doctrine, which enable the government to force the inclusion of certain content.\n\nBorrowing from the same playbook, Texas now argues that First Amendment values require, rather than prohibit, government interference with private speech. H.B. 20 declares that social media platforms are common carriers like telephone companies and thus are subject to onerous restrictions over who and what they may host. According to Texas, H.B. 20 serves the democratic interest in protecting the free exchange of ideas and information. But like the collectivist efforts that preceded it, Texas\' misguided attempt to advance "First Amendment rights in the Lone Star State" violates private platforms\' First Amendment rights to choose what speech they publish.\n\nAs we explained in a recently filed amicus curiae brief on behalf of the Cato Institute, courts have repeatedly rejected such regulations, and for good reasons.\n\nFirst, as a federal district court correctly noted last year, the First Amendment protects social media platforms\' discretion to publish or remove content. The Supreme Court established this right in the 1974 case Miami Herald Publishing Company v. Tornillo, when it struck down a Florida law that forced newspapers to print responses to their criticism of political candidates. The Court explained that this "right-of-reply" law infringed on newspapers\' right to choose what content they publish.\n\nThe Supreme Court affirmed that First Amendment rights apply with full force to internet media in 1997\'s Reno v. ACLU. Other federal courts have since upheld the editorial rights of search engines and social media sites. These precedents doom the Texas law. The state can\'t eviscerate platforms\' well-established First Amendment rights by arbitrarily calling them common carriers.\n\nSecond, efforts like H.B. 20 chill, rather than encourage, the exercise of free speech. Both the Florida right-of-reply law and the Fairness Doctrine actually discouraged the media from covering controversial topics that would trigger the forced-hosting requirements. Likewise, H.B. 20 will encourage platforms to ban entire subjects (say, discussions of terrorism) to avoid facing the unappetizing choice to either host objectionable viewpoints (such as pro-terrorism material) or face liability for removing each piece of content.\n\nThird, H.B. 20 violates fundamental property rights by forcing private platforms to host users and content they would otherwise exclude. The First Amendment does not authorize the government to co-opt private property to amplify certain viewpoints.\n\nThe supporters of the Texas law, like other conservative opponents of Big Tech, cite anecdotal accounts of inconsistent content moderation to support their claim of unfair bias. But it\'s more likely that these incidents are just casualties of the margin of error inherent in content moderation at scale. "Incorrect" removals of content happen millions of times per day to users representing every conceivable ideology. Conservatives are removed from platforms when they violate platforms\' terms of service, but Texas\' premise that conservatives are being unfairly targeted is unsubstantiated.\n\nBut even if it was substantiated, forced-hosting laws like H.B. 20 would contravene limited government, constitutional fidelity, and strong property rights, all of which are supposed to be core conservative values. If Texas Republicans really want to protect "conservative viewpoints," they should reacquaint themselves with those principles and reject giving the government more control over social media.', 'image': 'https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2022/04/timothy-hales-bennett-OwvRB-M3GwE-unsplash-scaled.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:31'}

It is a reminder why we need a wealth tax and why we need some serious regulation for Big Tech. One billionaire should not be able to turn the world upside down just because he plays by a different set of rules,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who believes the government should break up Big Tech companies to promote more competition.\n\nAsked whether Musk’s acquisition of Twitter was cause for concern, Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said: “Absolutely it does.”\n\n“He said he wants to make it this global message board. My first question to him, ‘Is your message board going to include Donald Trump?’ ” he said. “That’s a key question. If he lets that man rant and rave on Twitter, not in the best interests of America’s’ future.”\n\nDurbin, who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee, noted that his and other panels are exploring whether it would be appropriate to impose new regulations on Big Tech companies to incentivize them to do more to moderate content.\n\nSpeaking at Stanford last week, Obama said tech firms “need to be more transparent about how they operate” and crack down on “lies and conspiracy theories” that threaten the nation’s democratic system.\n\n“Without some standards, implications of this technology — for our elections, for our legal system, for our democracy, for rules of evidence, for our entire social order — are frightening and profound,” he warned.\n\nMusk hasn’t said whether he’ll let Trump, who was permanently barred from Twitter in January 2021, back on the platform, but his recent comments have fueled speculation that he might do so. Trump has indicated he’s not interested in getting back on Twitter, though he is known for changing his mind.\n\nSen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he also had concerns about what Musk’s purchase of Twitter might mean for the platform’s content standards.\n\nHe said he was looking into the matter but declined to provide any detail.\n\n“I’ve got some concerns. I think it will have to go through … some level of appropriate regulatory [review], and I’m doing some of my own checking,” he said.\n\nSen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) said Musk’s control over a major forum for political debate is alarming.\n\n“It’s always a concern when an oligarch may be owning the town square. I think we do need to pay a lot of attention to how it’s managed,” he said.\n\nMusk’s takeover of Twitter raises questions about what it means for his settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over fraud charges stemming from his August 2018 tweet that he had secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 per share, which pushed the car company’s stock higher.\n\nUnder the settlement, Musk must allow a Tesla lawyer to review any tweets containing material business information before hitting the send button.\n\nSen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), the chairwoman of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, said allowing Trump back on Twitter would be a major problem.\n\n“I think that’s very problematic,” she said of Trump’s possible return. “I don’t think that somebody who encouraged and organized a violent insurrection to take over our government should be allowed on Twitter.”\n\nAsked about the loosening of content standards, she said she “would certainly have concerns” but added she hadn’t looked at the deal closely enough to “get into a big analysis.”\n\nTrump, who has launched a social media venture that includes a platform intended to vie with Twitter, told Fox News on Monday that he doesn’t plan to return to Twitter.\n\n“I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,” he said, referring to his Truth Social messaging platform, before the deal was announced. “I hope Elon buys Twitter because he’ll make improvements to it and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth. The bottom line is, no, I am not going back to Twitter.”\n\nTwitter permanently suspended Trump because of what it called “the risk of further incitement of violence” after a mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to halt the certification of President Biden’s victory.\n\nTwitter later unveiled a civic integrity policy that prohibited the use of its services for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes. It also reserved the right to flag or reduce the visibility of tweets containing false or misleading information about civic processes.\n\nAt a TED conference this month, Musk stressed the importance of allowing free speech on Twitter.\n\n“Twitter has become kind of the de facto town square, so it’s just really important that people have both the reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely within the bounds of the law,” he said.\n\nConservatives on Monday applauded Musk’s move.\n\n“Elon Musk did his part for free speech today. Let’s hope the Supreme Court does as well,” former Rep. Mark Walker (N.C.), a conservative Republican running for Senate, tweeted Monday afternoon.\n\nDemocrats are worried what that means for policing claims that Biden stole the 2020 presidential election or misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n“I’m a big free speech guy, but this stuff isn’t working. It’s terrorizing democracy, and from that perspective I think it’s bad for Democrats in this sense: These Republican alt groups tend to dominate.

As YouTube celebrates its 17th birthday, the game-changing user-generated video platform once known for funny pet videos and other benign content continues to attract criticism for its alleged role in fostering extremism. Ample evidence casts doubt on the idea that social media platforms are radicalizing American youth, but high-profile anecdotes about bad turns allegedly inspired by YouTube, Facebook, and other sites make it hard to combat such claims. Now one such story may come before the Supreme Court—and threaten a foundational internet speech law.\n\nThe case (Gonzalez v. Google LLC) involves a man whose daughter was killed in a 2015 ISIS attack in Paris. The grieving father, Reynaldo Gonzalez, sued YouTube\'s parent company, Google, under the U.S. Anti-Terrorism Act. Gonzalez claims that ISIS posted recruitment videos on YouTube, that YouTube recommended these videos to users, and that this led to his daughter\'s death.\n\nGonzalez\'s circumstances are tragic, but his claim is convoluted and patently illogical. To buy it, you have to buy the idea that without YouTube, the terrorist group not only would be unable to recruit members but would cease to use existing networks to carry out attacks.\n\nThe Supreme Court has not yet decided whether it will hear Gonzalez\'s case. But if it does, it could give the Court a chance to consider the parameters of Section 230, the federal law preventing internet companies and users from being liable for all third-party speech (and pretty much the backbone of the internet as we know it).\n\nSCOTUSblog notes that in 2020, Justice Clarence Thomas suggested that "in an appropriate case, we should consider whether the text of this increasingly important statute aligns with the current state of immunity enjoyed by Internet platforms." (Thomas made a similar suggestion earlier this year.)\n\n"The petition in Gonzalez v. Google LLC tries to present itself as the case Thomas has been looking for," writes Andrew Hamm:\n\nThe district court dismissed Gonzalez\'s claim on the ground that Section 230 nonetheless protected Google for its recommendations because ISIS produced the videos, not Google. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit affirmed, concluding that Section 230 protects such recommendations, at least if the provider\'s algorithm treated content on its website similarly. However, the panel in Gonzalez considered itself bound to reach this result because of a recent case on the same issue that another 9th Circuit panel decided while Gonzalez was pending. The Gonzalez panel further concluded that, if it could resolve the question itself, Section 230 would not protect a provider\'s content recommendations. Gonzalez admits that the circuits to face this question are not split. Instead, Gonzalez suggests that, had his case simply come out before the other 9th Circuit decision, then Google would be the one seeking review. Regardless, he maintains, the providers\' financial dependence on advertisements and hence on algorithms that can target users makes this question of recommendations important to resolve.\n\nGonzalez is far from the first person to sue social media companies over terrorist acts. But these people "have yet to talk a court into agreeing with their arguments," as Tim Cushing noted at Techdirt last fall.\n\n"The facts in these cases are invariably awful: often people have been brutally killed and their loved ones are seeking redress for their loss. There is a natural, and perfectly reasonable, temptation to give them some sort of remedy from someone, but as we argued in our brief, that someone cannot be an internet platform," wrote constitutional lawyer Cathy Gellis in 2017:\n\nThere are several reasons for this, including some that have nothing to do with Section 230. For instance, even if Section 230 did not exist and platforms could be liable for the harms resulting from their users\' use of their services, for them to be liable there would have to be a clear connection between the use of the platform and the harm.\n\nSection 230 "should prevent a court from ever even reaching the tort law analysis," added Gellis. "With Section 230, a platform should never find itself having to defend against liability for harm that may have resulted from how people used it."\n\nA new study backs up what advocates for Section 230 have been saying for a long time: The law protects small companies and creators more than big tech giants.\n\n"If you understand the mechanisms by which Section 230 actually works, the key is that it gets frivolous and wasteful lawsuits kicked out of court much earlier—when the costs are still intense, but more bearable," points out Mike Masnick in a Techdirt post about the study. "Without Section 230, the end result of the court case may be the same—where the company wins—but the costs would be much, much higher. For Facebook and Google that\'s not going to make a huge difference. But for smaller companies, it can be the difference between life and death."\n\n"Larger enterprises are less impacted by lawsuits," point out the authors of the study, in a report titled "Understanding Section 230 & the Impact of Litigation on Small Providers." A large company "may already have: 1) lawyers ready to deal with lawsuits (allowing the business to continue with minimal disruption); 2) insurance coverage that can offset the cost of a defense, a settlement, or a damage award; and 3) sufficient revenue and cash reserves such that most cases are viewed as a cost of doing business rather than a cataclysmic event."\n\nSmall companies are less likely to have or be able to afford any of these things, making it less likely that they will fight even lawsuits that they would win.\n\nPoliticians, alas, have taken to scapegoating Section 230 for basically anything they or their constituents don\'t like about the internet. And lawyers keep getting creative in their anti–Section 230 arguments, suggesting that while Section 230 may broadly protect internet platforms from liability for many things that users post, the law does not covers various facets of these platforms—their design, their algorithms, etc..\n\nOccasionally, judges appear sympathetic to this. In Taamneh v. Twitter, which the 9th Circuit ruled on last year, Judge Marsha Berzon wrote that Section 230 protects "only traditional activities of publication and distribution—such as deciding whether to publish, withdraw, or alter content—and does not include activities that promote or recommend content or connect content users to each other. I urge this Court to reconsider our precedent en banc to the extent that it holds that section 230 extends to the use of machine-learning algorithms to recommend content and connections to users."\n\n"This is a really weird, really dangerous place to start drawing the line in Section 230 lawsuits," wrote Tim Cushing last summer. "Algorithms react to input from users. If YouTube can\'t be held directly responsible for videos uploaded by users, it makes sense it would be immunized against algorithmically suggesting content based on users\' actions and preferences. The algorithm does next to nothing on its own without input from content viewers. It takes a user to really get it moving."\n\nFREE MINDS\n\nA federal appeals court has rejected a university\'s ban on "discriminatory harassment." The University of Central Florida\'s "discriminatory harassment" ban likely violates the First Amendment, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals said. The case is Speech First, Inc. v. Cartwright, and you can read the whole ruling here. In essence, the court found the school\'s policy against allegedly discriminatory speech to be too broad:\n\n[T]he policy (1) prohibits a wide range of "verbal, physical, electronic, and other" expression concerning any of (depending on how you count) some 25 or so characteristics; (2) states that prohibited speech "may take many forms, including verbal acts, name-calling, graphic or written statements" and even "other conduct that may be humiliating"; (3) employs a gestaltish "totality of known circumstances" approach to determine whether particular speech, for instance, "unreasonably alters" another student\'s educational experience; and (4) reaches not only a student\'s own speech, but also her conduct "encouraging," "condoning," or "failing to intervene" to stop another student\'s speech. The policy, in short, is staggeringly broad, and any number of statements—some of which are undoubtedly protected by the First Amendment—could qualify for prohibition under its sweeping standards. To take a few obvious examples, the policy targets "verbal, physical, electronic or other conduct" based on "race," "ethnicity," "religion [or] non-religion," "sex," and "political affiliation." Among the views that Speech First\'s members have said they want to advocate are that "abortion is immoral," that the government "should not be able to force religious organizations to recognize marriages with which they disagree," that "affirmative action is deeply unfair," that "a man cannot become a woman because he \'feels\' like one," that "illegal immigration is dangerous," and that "the Palestinian movement is anti-Semitic."\n\nIn a concurring opinion, Judge Stanley Marcus warned against "the grave peril posed by a policy that effectively polices adherence to intellectual dogma."\n\n"History provides us with ample warning of those times and places when colleges and universities have stopped pursuing truth and have instead turned themselves into cathedrals for the worship of certain dogma," wrote Marcus. "By depriving itself of academic institutions that pursue truth over any other concern, a society risks falling into the abyss of ignorance. Humans are not smart enough to have ideas that lie beyond challenge and debate."\n\nThe Volokh Conspiracy has more on the ruling (which includes the lovely line "the state is a really big boy") here.\n\nFREE MARKETS\n\nPrivate space mission on its way back to earth. The first privately-funded trip to the International Space Station started its return trip yesterday. More from CNN:\n\nThe mission, called AX-1, was brokered by the Houston, Texas-based startup Axiom Space, which books rocket rides, provides all the necessary training, and coordinates flights to the ISS for anyone who can afford it. The four crew members—Michael López-Alegría, a former NASA astronaut-turned-Axiom employee who is commanding the mission; Israeli businessman Eytan Stibbe; Canadian investor Mark Pathy; and Ohio-based real estate magnate Larry Connor—left the space station aboard their SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule on Sunday at 9:10 pm EST….They will spend about one day free flying through orbit before plummeting back into the atmosphere and parachuting to a splashdown landing off the coast of Florida around 1 pm ET Monday. AX-1, which launched on April 8, was originally billed as a 10-day mission, but delays extended the mission by about a week.\n\nThis isn\'t the first time private citizens have been able to pay for seats on spacecraft. "But AX-1 is the first mission with a crew entirely comprised of private citizens with no active members of a government astronaut corps accompanying them in the capsule during the trip to and from the ISS," reports CNN. "It\'s also the first time private citizens have traveled to the ISS on a US-made spacecraft."\n\nAnd it\'s also a powerful reminder that perhaps the next era of space exploration needn\'t be government funded and managed.\n\nQUICK HITS\n\n• Air Force Major General William T.

Musk haters have taken to the site to declare that Donald Trump will now probably win the 2024 election, that Musk\'s bid is really about white power, that Section 230 must be reformed, and that, yes, Musk\'s new policies will be lethal. (Perhaps the death toll will be even larger than net neutrality\'s!)\n\nSo, for users of the platform, what\'s likely to change?\n\nMusk has panned the site\'s existing content moderation policies, saying they are too restrictive and encroach on people\'s ability to speak freely without being censored. Some liberalization of these policies and the re-platforming of controversial figures like former President Donald Trump—who was banned in the wake of the January 6 riot for inciting violence among his fans—seems likely, though unpopular with droves of users.\n\nAt the mid-April TED conference in Vancouver, Musk talked about his interest in making Twitter\'s algorithm open-source. The Diff\'s Byrne Hobart took this a step further, outlining how "Twitter should monetize a protocol rather than run an app," and explaining the tension between Twitter as a consumer product and as "a way for individual users to update a universal shared database, which can then be filtered based on who\'s interested in what." Hobart claims that it\'s possible that Twitter has been "radically miss-monetized," and that Musk could potentially realign its priorities. However, little of the online discourse has focused on the technical possibilities.\n\nThe new Twitter owner has, through coy tweets, hinted that his new policies will not be applied arbitrarily and that consistent application will mean some number of right-wing users currently cheering his new ownership will surely be disappointed:\n\nI hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 25, 2022\n\nA social media platform\'s policies are good if the most extreme 10% on left and right are equally unhappy — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 19, 2022\n\nElsewhere, Musk has said that Twitter is a "town square" or "public square," and that banning people from using the platform effectively prevents them from participating in the important discussions of the day.\n\nThough people who care about fostering a culture of free speech may agree with the tenor of Musk\'s comments, the analogy is a terrible one. For most of America, the public square is the school board meeting and the town council meeting. There are also numerous other privates spaces for civic engagement: the church pulpit and the post-sermon fray it inspires; neighborhood listservs and the cesspool that is NextDoor; or maybe it\'s Facebook, in-person conversations, and email lists. For many millions of Americans, Twitter is not integral to hashing out values, concerns, and disagreements. Think of the implications if we expected the government to treat such companies—which have their own terms of service and standards that they are free to decide and we are free to consent to—as something akin to public utilities.\n\nIf anything, the new owner of a social media company should convey an inflated sense of the platform\'s worth! But Musk has at times, despite his forceful defense of free speech culture on the internet, repeated confused talking points that indicate scattered thinking while simultaneously failing to fully flesh out what day-to-day operations will look like. For example, a lot of content moderation involves the unsexy—and not very ideological—challenge of keeping spam under control. And, as Mike Masnick points out at Techdirt, Musk doesn\'t seem to have a particularly robust understanding of "hate speech" and how much of what we call hate speech is, in fact, protected by the First Amendment.\n\nA lot remains to be seen about how Twitter will change and what Musk will bring to the table. Optimism, with some reservations about Musk\'s ability to execute, seems warranted. Hysteria—like declaring that it\'s now open season for white supremacists, that Musk\'s vision for free speech will be "lethal," or that Musk is an echo of imperialist, colonizer forebears because he wants to go to Mars—is not.', 'image': 'https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2022/04/thumbnail-9-3.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:46'}

But Musk\'s stated ideals contradict his own actions.\n\nWhat Musk says he wants\n\nMusk has made clear he wants less moderation — which he considers censorship — on the platform.\n\n"Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated," he said in Monday\'s announcement about the acquisition.\n\nHe also said he wants to defeat the "spambots," or automated accounts that mimic real users; open the algorithm to public inspection and "authenticate all humans" using the platform.\n\nMusk laid out a definition of speech in a TED interview last week.\n\n"A good sign as to whether there is free speech is, is someone you don\'t like allowed to say something you don\'t like? If that is the case, we have free speech," he said.\n\nMusk said Twitter would abide by national laws that restrict speech around the world. Beyond that, he said, he\'d be "very reluctant" to delete posts or permanently ban users who violate the company\'s rules.\n\nHe had previously criticized Trump\'s ban from social media in the wake of the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Twitter and Facebook permanently banned Trump\'s account on the grounds that he incited violence.\n\n"A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech," Musk tweeted days after Trump was banned from both Facebook and Twitter.\n\nHow Musk responds to disagreement\n\nMusk\'s own history, however, puts in doubt his commitment to let people he doesn\'t like speak. As the newsletter Popular Information has documented, Musk has regularly blocked users who criticize him or Tesla; threatened pro-union Tesla employees and company whistleblowers; and has aggressively gone after short-sellers and journalists who are critical of Tesla, sometimes calling their work "false" or "misleading."\n\nIn 2018, he launched a vendetta against Linette Lopez, an Insider journalist critical of Tesla, a move which writer Felix Salmon called "obsessive and deranged."\n\nMusk\'s popular tweets typically send a swarm of his social media fans directly to the accounts of reporters to harass them for hours or days.\n\nSome academics say that Musk\'s hands-off approach threatens to bring Twitter to its bad old days, when harassment and abuse were rampant.\n\n"With Musk, his posturing of free speech — just leave everything up — that would be bad in and of itself," said Paul Barrett, the deputy director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University. "If you stop moderating — with automated systems and human reviews — a site like Twitter, in the space of a short period of time, you would have a cesspool."\n\nSome former Twitter employees are also dismayed by Musk\'s successful bid for the company.\n\n"Twitter is going to let a man-child essentially take over their platform," said Leslie Miley, a former Twitter employee who has also worked for Google and Apple. Miley, who was the only Black engineer at Twitter in a leadership position when he left the company in 2015, echoed doubts shared by others about Musk\'s grasp of the platform\'s complexities.\n\n"I am not sure if Elon knows what he is getting," Miley said. "He may just find that having Twitter is a lot different than wanting Twitter."\n\nUnfettered expression does not attract advertisers\n\nA decade ago, a Twitter executive called the company "the free speech wing of the free speech party," underscoring its commitment to untrammeled freedom of expression. But the company reversed itself after reports of online abuse and harassment became frequent.\n\nIn the U.S., a visceral 2014 article by journalist Amanda Hess exposed the incessant, vile harassment many women faced just for posting on Twitter or other online forums. Twitter also learned about the consequences of an unmoderated social platform: mainly, that it undercut their funding from advertisers.\n\nAds are how Twitter makes money, and companies generally don\'t want their ads running against violent threats, hate speech that bleeds into incitement or incendiary information aimed at tipping elections or undermining public health.\n\nGoogle, Barrett pointed out, quickly learned this lesson the hard way when major companies like Toyota and Anheuser-Busch yanked their ads after they ran ahead of YouTube videos produced by extremists in 2015.\n\nOnce it was clear just how unhealthy the conversation had gotten, Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey spent years trying to improve what he called the "health" of the conversation on the platform.\n\nThe company was an early adopter of the "report abuse" button after U.K. member of parliament Stella Creasy received a barrage of rape and death threats on the platform. The online abuse was the result of a seemingly positive tweet in support of feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez, who successfully advocated for novelist Jane Austen to appear on a British banknote. Creasy\'s online harasser was sent to prison for 18 weeks.\n\nTwitter has continued to craft rules and invest in staff and technology that detected violent threats, harassment and misinformation that violated its policies. After evidence emerged that Russia used Twitter\'s platforms to try to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election, social media companies stepped up their efforts against political misinformation. All have struggled with defining "misinformation," however, and been accused of both leaving up false content as well as over-censoring legitimate posts.\n\nHard to unwind moderation\n\nThe big question now is how far Musk wants to ratchet back these systems — and whether users and advertisers will stick around if he does.\n\nLike Miley, the former Twitter engineer, experts who have studied content moderation and researched Twitter express doubt that Musk knows what he is getting into. After all, there are plenty of fledgling examples of so-called free speech-focused platforms that have been launched in the past few years as Twitter alternatives, largely by conservatives unhappy with the Twitter\'s crackdown on hate, harassment and misinformation. Many such sites have struggled to deal with toxic content, and at least one has been cut off by its own technology providers in protest.\n\n"This move just shows how effective (moderation features) have been to annoy those in power," said Kirsten Martin, a professor of technology ethics at the University of Notre Dame. "I would be worried as to how this would change Twitter\'s values."\n\nThe fact that no other bidders emerged in public before Musk\'s deal was a sign that other would-be acquirers might find Twitter too difficult to improve, said Third Bridge analyst Scott Kessler.\n\n"This platform is pretty much the same one we\'ve had over the last decade or so," Kessler said. "You\'ve had a lot of smart people trying to figure out what they should do, and they\'ve had trouble. It\'s probably going to be tough to make a lot of headway."\n\nEven now, Americans say they\'re more likely to be harassed on social media than any other online forum, with women, people of color and LGBTQ users reporting a disproportionate amount of that abuse. Roughly 80% of users believe the companies are still doing only a "fair or poor" job of handling that harassment, according to a Pew Research Center survey of U.S. adults last year.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/04/30/39aaad79-fd57-40fa-b203-bc4143cf40f2/thumbnail/1200x630g8/aef00fb0dcf931880dd52af0a50dc345/gettyimages-1206290121.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:24'}

Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) questioned Garland on the matter, pointing out that Joe Biden’s messengers, including White House chief of staff Ronald Klain, have said on national television that the president is confident his son, Hunter Biden, did nothing wrong.\n\n“The president’s already told his subordinates—clearly, these are people he can fire at will—that he and his family did nothing wrong. How can the American people be confident that his administration is conducting a serious investigation?” Hagerty asked.\n\n“Because we put the investigation in the hands of a Trump appointee, from the previous administration, who’s the United States attorney for the District of Delaware, and because you have me as the attorney general, who is committed to the independence of the Justice Department from any influence from the White House in criminal matters,” Garland, a Biden appointee, responded.\n\nThe probe was first revealed by Hunter Biden in late 2020. He claimed that prosecutors were investigating his “tax affairs.”\n\nDavid Weiss, the U.S. attorney for Delaware, later confirmed the investigation but has declined to share any details.\n\nA grand jury subpoena showed that prosecutors compelled banks to share financial records of Hunter Biden and the president’s brother, James Biden. Additionally, the mother of one of Hunter Biden’s children has said she testified to authorities pursuant to a subpoena.\n\nHagerty pressed Garland on whether a special counsel is appropriate, considering the public comments by Klain and White House communications director Kate Bedingfield.\n\n“There’s an obvious conflict of interest here. Because those who are investigating the Biden family and their enterprise can be fired by the head of the family who is being investigated,” Hagerty said.\n\nGarland declined to say whether the department has or is considering appointing a special counsel, though he noted that special counsels are also employees of the Department of Justice.\n\nHe also would not answer when asked if he agreed with the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller, who was tasked with investigating allegations of collusion between Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia.\n\n“The question of whether to have a special counsel is one that is internal decision-making in the department, so I don’t want to make any judgments one way or the other,” Garland told Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) later in the hearing. “I’m quite comfortable with the United States attorney for that district continuing in the role that he’s playing.”', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/26/garland-before-senate-1200x800.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:30'}

In Canada, vaccine-free Canadians still cannot board a train or a plane and travel from one region of the country to another.\n\nIn Canada, air and train travel are regulated by the federal government, even when you travel within the same province. The feds have made it so only a vaccine passport, or very limited jab exemptions, will afford you the opportunity to visit family, friends, or travel for work.\n\nThis means that if you lived in, let’s say, Kitchener, Ontario, you could not get on a VIA Rail train and travel to Toronto… even though you could travel from Kitchener to Toronto on a commuter train that is not under federal jurisdiction.\n\nIsn’t “science” wonderful!\n\nOh, and vaccine-free Canadians also can’t LEAVE the country. Unjabbed Canadians are told they can’t “put others at risk” by boarding a plane with vaccinated people (because vaccines suddenly…work?). Apparently, it is good for the unvaccinated to stay in Canada, even though … they are risk to everyone else who is protected by a vaccine?\n\nTrudeau’s insecurity on display\n\nNow, on the one hand it is quite easy to understand why Trudeau is acting like an evil dictator: he has proven himself to be an immoral tyrant on many occasions. However, given the fact that other leftist tyrants have eased up, it is clearly not just leftism or progressivism that causing him to trap Canadians indefinitely in their home like real-life versions of The Truman Show. (How fitting that it was Canadian Jim Carrey who starred in that film.)\n\nThere is something unique about Trudeau that is causing him to become “regressive” as the rest of the leftist dominated West is affording vaccine-free citizens their civil rights.\n\nTo the outside world, Trudeau may look like a confident – if not cringeworthy – tin-pot dictator, but in reality, he is a 50-year-old boy with little to no virtue. He is essentially a spoiled teenager who can remember lines and present himself well in a tailored suit and has a family name that tricked people into thinking he was competent.\n\nHis (Canadian) father, Pierre Trudeau, for all his faults, was shrewd and intelligent – even if evil. Justin Trudeau is evil and unintelligent and quite obtuse.\n\nI can’t help but think he believes he must prove himself as being his own verified dictator in order to fill his daddy’s shoes. Simply put, he is insecure and projecting.\n\n— Article continues below Petition — PETITION: Ask Elon Musk to REINSTATE LifeSite\'s Twitter accounts Show Petition Text 7936 have signed the petition.

Sign this Petition Please SIGN and SHARE this petition to the new owner of Twitter, Elon Musk, asking him to reinstate LifeSiteNews\' truth-telling Twitter accounts which have been suspended since early 2021. After contentious negotiations, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has purchased Twitter, thereby transforming the tech giant into a private company. A self-styled "free speech absolutist," Mr. Musk\'s entrepreneurial spirit may define his approach to governing Twitter, where, in the marketplace of ideas, the best ideas - not those aided by censorship - will naturally prevail among the competition. Of course, there are limits to free speech. But, for too long, Big Tech giants (including, Twitter, Google, YouTube and Facebook) have subjected their conservative and Christian users to all forms of censorship, desperately trying to silence our voices. So if, as it seems, Mr. Musk will level the playing field for conservatives and Christians and allow a true exchange of ideas to occur on his platform, then we look forward to our chance to re-engage on Twitter. Please SIGN and SHARE this petition to the new owner of Twitter, Elon Musk, asking him to reactivate LifeSiteNews\' truth-telling Twitter accounts which have been suspended since early 2021. They are: https://twitter.com/LifeSite\n\nhttps://twitter.com/LSNCatholic\n\nhttps://twitter.com/WCDM_LSN\n\nhttps://twitter.com/WCEA_LSN These accounts have been blocked by the outgoing Twitter regime for more than a year for calling a ‘transgender woman’ (Assistant Secretary of Health, \'Rachel\' Levine), a man, and for tweeting an article about the same person. The article we tweeted makes mention of the troubling paradox of having a person who denies the basic science of the human anatomy be in an authoritative position in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), but does not cast aspersions or any other such “hate speech” against Levine, according to Twitter’s "rules." It is our fervant hope that Mr. Musk intends to allow - rather than censor - our descriptions of reality as we know them to be true in regards to human sexuality, as well as in other areas of life. Mr. Musk evidently understands how significant freedom of speech is to the functioning of a free society as he was quoted as saying that this deal is important for "the future of civlization." LifeSiteNews believes that being able to spread the truth in charity is absolutely vital for the future of society, as the "truth shall make you free." (Jn 8:32) And so, in order for us to charitably spread the truth far and wide, we now seek to re-engage on Twitter\'s public square.

The New Democrats have cozied up to Trudeau in order to pretend they are a sane and legitimate party and have promised to prop up his regime. Promises don’t really mean anything when politicians make them, so we shouldn’t assume that the communists will be loyal to each other.\n\nHowever, it is obvious that public opinion is against Trudeau to a degree that he will not be able to withstand.\n\nThere is a reason why Trudeau had to resort to the Emergencies Act to squash the Freedom Convoy; no one wanted to stop it until they were forced to by law.\n\nThe various levels of provincial and municipal governance could have stopped the movement the way they stop any non-violent protest – but they didn’t want to.\n\nDoes this mean that the cops and all the citizens supported the convoy? Of course not, but I think that enough of them saw how absurd things have become and just wanted something to make the whole charade of 2020-2021-2022 go away.\n\nThe application of the Emergencies Act was wildly unpopular among Canadians, both on the Left and the Right. Leftists were happy to see the movement end but were unimpressed that Trudeau ended it in such an absurd way. Conservatives generally supported the movement, and therefore saw Trudeau as a complete lunatic for doing what he did.\n\nAll of this means that in the long run Trudeau is hurting his reputation, even among his base. This is not news for him as the Conservative leadership race heats up.\n\nFreedom is on the move\n\nWithout giving the impression that I think Canada is on the brink of some massive societal restoration, I would be remiss if I did not speak to the positives.\n\nCurrently, we are witnessing the first real Conservative leadership race in a long time. Pierre Pollievre is filling arenas and convention centres with freedom-loving crowds, and Leslyn Lewis is making leftist journalists look silly on national TV. It is worth remembering that we are talking about a leadership race, not an election, but the swell of right-wing uprising is palpable.\n\nIn fact, the last time something like this happened was after a groundswell of Christian/right-wing sentiment following years of leftist oppression under the former Trudeau and his successors.\n\nAs a result of that, we had Stephen Harper for a decade who, although not perfect, was a saint compared with Trudeau.\n\nThe economy is tanking in Canada, and goods and services are becoming prohibitively expensive for average people. Trudeau and his cronies can appeal to idealism and progressivism all they want, but even left-wingers get ticked off and want change when they are struggling to fill the tank.\n\nUltimately, Trudeau is continuing to trap vaccine-free Canadians from participating fully in society because he knows that if he pulls the plug on his last failing restriction, that his regime will go down the drain.\n\nKennedy Hall is an Ontario based journalist for LifeSiteNews.

Jody Hice (R-Ga.), in all caps. A Twitter survey by Sen. Ted Cruz asked if Musk’s purchase was a good thing, with the only options to answer being “yes” or “no, I hate free speech.” His fellow Texan, Rep. John Carter, signaled his approval with no words at all; three clapping-hands emojis were sufficient.\n\nA pot-smoking, meme-posting evangelist for electric vehicles may be an unlikely hero for conservatives. But the Tesla chief executive’s amorphous vow to restore free speech to the social media platform has resonated among Republicans, who see themselves — starting with their de facto leader, former President Trump — as unfairly targeted by Twitter’s content moderation efforts.\n\nConservatives said their euphoric outpouring was bigger than the possible return of @RealDonaldTrump and changes to Twitter’s ownership. Rather, they see Musk’s takeover as a symbolic, and cathartic, blow against Big Tech, which the right has increasingly viewed with antipathy.\n\n“There’s a gut reaction from a lot of people, going, ‘You know what, it’s about time they get their comeuppance,’ ” said Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.). “It finally feels like someone is standing up for a principle that has been going in an opposite direction lately: less free speech, less ability to express yourself — if you are a conservative.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk centered his bid for Twitter on the premise that the social media company, which he considers a “digital town square,” is too restrictive in clamping down on expression.\n\n“I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” Musk tweeted Monday morning.\n\nMusk’s own politics are idiosyncratic. He’s the foremost face of clean vehicles who called for immediately increasing oil and gas production after the Ukraine-Russia war spiked energy prices. He fled California for Texas because of high taxes but declined to weigh in on Texas’ restrictive abortion law, saying he preferred to “stay out of politics.” He has described himself as politically independent and registered to vote in California with no party preference.\n\nFor conservatives, Musk’s crusade against content restrictions has struck a chord. Roughly half of Republicans feel they cannot express themselves freely on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, according to a Morning Consult poll conducted this month, far exceeding the percentage of Democrats and independents who felt similarly.\n\nPolitics Who did Twitter ban during the Trump era, and why? Could banned Trump allies return to Twitter under Elon Musk? A look at the former president’s backers who were kicked off the social media platform.\n\n“Twitter is a platform that I and many others believe has been more aggressive in blocking Republicans and conservatives than they have toward people on the left,” said Rep. Austin Scott (R-Ga.). “I’m hoping and expecting he will undo that.”\n\nScott is not an avid Twitter user; he does not even have the app on his phone. But he did tweet a congratulatory message to Musk, adding a plea to “restore free speech and bring back President Trump!”\n\nTrump was permanently kicked off the platform on Jan. 8, 2021 — two days after a group of his supporters overran the U.S. Capitol in hopes of blocking the certification of Joe Biden’s win. Twitter imposed the ban “due to the risk of further incitement of violence.”\n\nSo far, Musk has not indicated how he’d handle the former president’s account. Trump, meanwhile, has shown no interest in rejoining the platform that helped power his political rise and gave real-time narration of his presidency.\n\n“I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,” Trump told Fox News, referring to his fledgling social media network. “I hope Elon buys Twitter, because he’ll make improvements to it, and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth.”\n\nRepublicans see Trump as just one example of Twitter’s bias. A number of high-profile conservatives have been suspended or blocked from the platform, including the account of the Babylon Bee, a satirical news website that was suspended for a tweet naming Assistant Health Secretary Rachel Levine, who is transgender, “Man of the Year.”\n\nThe account was locked as a violation of Twitter’s ban on hate speech. Seth Dillon, CEO of Babylon Bee, refused to remove the tweet, asserting that “truth is not hate speech.”\n\n“It’s completely broken,” said Harmeet Dhillon, a conservative lawyer who has sued Twitter multiple times on behalf of clients who were banned. “The company can try to affect elections, try to ban politicians from speaking ... use algorithms, enable false accounts to constantly affect what people see.”\n\nThe extent to which conservatives face bias on the platform has been fiercely examined and debated. A study this month by researchers at MIT and Yale found that Republican users tend to be suspended more often than Democrats but that conservatives are more likely to share misinformation that would provoke such suspensions.\n\nSo far, Musk has offered little explanation as to how his free speech values would play out in practice. He said on Monday that his goals include “enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots and authenticating all humans.”\n\nBut such efforts would require some attempt at regulating content, especially by verifying users. A social media network without any moderation at all could swamp the platform with all sorts of unsavory or offensive material, such as pornography or terrorist content, as well as the online abuse and harassment that are already common occurrences.\n\n“If you don’t have content moderation, you actually have less free speech. The people who are the loudest are the bullies and harassers that drive people away,” said Katie Harbath, a former Republican operative who has worked as public policy director for Facebook.\n\nDhillon, the conservative attorney based in California, said she is not hoping for Musk to completely abandon regulation.\n\n“There’s plenty of room for them to do old-school content moderation of the kind they originally did,” she said, citing as an example prohibitions on making death threats.\n\nWith Musk’s plans still unknown, Harbath, who now runs a tech policy strategy firm, said the celebratory conservatives “are making a hell of a lot of assumptions of what Elon means by all this stuff. I don’t think they should assume he is completely on their side.”\n\nRepublicans’ triumphant tone on Twitter starkly contrasted with the more muted reaction from liberal politicians. Far fewer Democratic members of Congress weighed in on Twitter, although those who did were markedly unenthused.\n\n“This deal is dangerous for our democracy. Billionaires like Elon Musk play by a different set of rules than everyone else, accumulating power for their own gain. We need a wealth tax and strong rules to hold Big Tech accountable,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), with whom Musk has sparred on Twitter.\n\nHuizenga, the Michigan congressman, expected that liberals would be none too pleased with Musk’s purchase. Indeed, some vowed to leave the site entirely — much to Huizenga’s amusement.\n\n“It seems like ‘I’m quitting Twitter’ has become the ‘I’m moving to Canada if Trump wins,’ ” he said, adding, “It’s kind of fun sitting back, watching them completely lose their collective minds.”', 'image': 'https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ac14b68/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2941x1544+0+208/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F86%2F23%2Ff46440b54bd7a6509db9c67caab5%2Fphilanthropy-billionaries-tax-28080.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:57'}

(Patrick Pleul/Pool/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nElon Musk Reveals More Details of His Plans for Twitter After Buyout\n\nElon Musk revealed more details of what he has in mind for changes at Twitter after it was confirmed that the company had accepted his buyout offer, with the tech mogul’s plans including new features and ways to enhance trust in the platform.\n\nTwitter’s board of directors said on April 25 that it had approved Musk’s offer to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share in cash, in a deal worth around $44 billion.\n\nThe buyout represents a 38 percent premium over Twitter’s closing stock price on April 1, with Parag Agrawal, CEO of Twitter, saying in a statement that he believes the deal “is the best path forward for Twitter’s stockholders.”\n\n‘Bedrock of a Functioning Democracy’\n\nIn a statement, Musk provided some details about what kind of changes he has in mind for the social media platform, whose commitment to free speech he has repeatedly called into question.\n\n“Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,” Musk said. This dovetails with his earlier statements that Twitter functions as a “de facto town square” where important conversations should be able to take place with as few constraints as possible.\n\nMusk said Monday that Twitter has “tremendous potential” and that he wants to work with the company and its users to “unlock” and make the platform “better than ever.”\n\nHe said he plans on “enhancing” Twitter with new features, which he did not provide further details on. Musk earlier created a Twitter poll asking users if they want an edit button on the platform, suggesting that this could be one of the changes he is seeking to effect.\n\nMusk also said on Monday he wants to make the platform’s algorithms “open source to increase trust,” while “defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.”\n\nThis, too, reinforces his earlier remarks that his objective in seeking to buy Twitter and turn it into a private company was to transform it into a bastion of free speech by opening up its algorithm to public scrutiny and by making its moderation policies more transparent.\n\n‘Black Box Algorithm’\n\nA self-described “free speech absolutist,” Musk told the audience at a recent TED event in Vancouver, Canada, that Twitter should permit unconstrained expression, though it should do so in line with the law.\n\n“In my view, Twitter should match the laws of the country,” Musk said, acknowledging reasonable legal caps on free speech like direct incitement to violence or shouting “fire” in a crowded theater.\n\n“But going beyond that and having it be unclear who’s making what changes to where, having tweets mysteriously be promoted and demoted with no insight into what’s going on, having a black box algorithm promote some things and not other things, I think this can be quite dangerous,” Musk said.\n\n“My strong, intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization,” he added.\n\nErr on Side of Free Speech\n\nMusk also expressed reluctance about permanent bans of users from Twitter, preferring instead temporary “time-outs.”\n\n“I’m not saying that I have all the answers here,” Musk said at the TED talk. But I do think that we want to be just very reluctant to delete things, just be very cautious with permanent bans. Timeouts I think are better than permanent bans.”\n\nIn terms of calibrating Twitter’s moderation policies, Musk said he’d want to err on the side of free speech.\n\n“If in doubt, let the speech, let it exist,” Musk said. “If it’s a grey area, I would say let the tweet exist. But obviously in a case where there’s perhaps a lot of controversy, that you would not want to necessarily promote that tweet.”\n\n“A good sign as to whether there’s free speech is, is someone you don’t like allowed to say something you don’t like,” Musk said. “And if that is the case, then we have free speech.”\n\n‘We Are Concerned’\n\nMusk has repeatedly questioned Twitter’s commitment to free speech, after accusations that the platform suppressed some minority and politically conservative viewpoints, claims Twitter has denied.\n\nMany free speech advocates have hailed Musk’s takeover bid, while those opposed have expressed fear that fewer constraints on expression on Twitter will make it too easy to abuse the platform’s reach and power by, for example, spreading disinformation.\n\nIn a series of tweets reacting to Musk’s takeover moves, Amnesty International expressed concern about the erosion of policies meant to protect users.\n\n“We are concerned with any steps that Twitter might take to erode enforcement of the policies and mechanisms designed to protect users,” Amnesty International wrote.\n\n“The last thing we need is a Twitter that wilfully turns a blind eye to violent and abusive speech against users,” the group said.\n\nAs it was confirmed Musk would purchase Twitter, the Tesla founder urged his “worst critics” to stay on the platform.\n\n“I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” he wrote in a Twitter post.\n\nDan Ives, an analyst at investment firm Wedbush Securities, told the BBC that he expects most users will take a “wait-and-see approach” on whether they stay or leave the platform, based on the changes that take place.\n\n“Now it’s about courting new users and stopping defectors from the platform,” Ives told the outlet.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/19/article-image-cal-thomas-3-1200x804.jpeg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:50'}

This feels like the first flashback scene we see in a dystopian drama after the words “SIX MONTHS EARLIER …” Quite where we’ll be in six months’ time as far as Twitter is concerned remains tantalisingly unclear, but it seems difficult to imagine it will be either a more or less pleasant space. It’s a social media platform. I’m not sure what further evidence humanity needs before we cotton on to the idea that such a thing might be an intrinsically toxic concept. Of course, there will always be some people who think it just hasn’t been done right yet. Like communism, or a British version of The Daily Show.\n\nAnyway, if Musk’s takeover goes through, he’ll assume control of a platform where the people on the right are incredibly angry about free speech, and those on the left are incredibly angry about hate speech.

So the platforms are designed to make them angry. You might consider the anger worth it for your version of advertising (I myself will post this column on Twitter), but even then it is a weirdly grim cost of doing business that just conceivably ought to be weighed far more carefully than it is.\n\nUnlike the UK, Musk manufactures other things besides anger, but Twitter is the platform where, in a single calendar year, his posts led to multiple lawsuits, a fall in his stock price, and a Securities and Exchange Commission settlement that resulted in his chairmanship of Tesla being forcibly ended. Yet in a move that will feel familiar to a lot of Twitter users, he has not logged off, but leaned in further. When I was a child, there was a guy called Victor Kiam who owned Remington, and he would personally feature in the firm’s electric razor adverts, going: “I liked the shaver so much, I bought the company.” It would be nice to see Musk do something similar. “I liked calling innocent people paedos so much, I bought the company.”\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the distress of Twitter users feels overplayed. Perhaps Elon embodies a kind of radical honesty and self-awareness not shared by other denizens of the site. People who seem to spend half their lives complaining about Twitter, on Twitter, seem stunned by the idea that a shitposter would ultimately buy it. Catch up! It doesn’t feel like a complete coincidence that all social media platforms are owned by men you’d run a mile from socially.\n\nMusk is one of them – a brilliant, horrid, ridiculous and very occasionally endearing grotesque. A sort of intergalactically successful Dominic Cummings. And yet, despite Elon’s give-a-toss gift for making himself what Twitter users might call the “main character”, I can’t detest him entirely. If he pulls off the radical green energy transition embodied in Tesla, or even just one of his other wildly ambitious schemes, humans might have to accept some of the shit that’s gone with it. Accept it angrily, of course – how else, we’re on a social media platform! – but accept it nonetheless. A huge number of other people in public life behave appallingly and achieve absolutely nothing but harm.\n\nBut if endlessly righteous folk balk at the mere idea of necessary evils, why do they act like their own involvement in Twitter is one? It isn’t. It’s easy to focus on the high-profile people who are always on Twitter. But the sheer numbers of highly successful, highly creative and highly interesting people in the worlds of arts, business, science and beyond who AREN’T on it should tell a much more powerful story. They are part of all kinds of era-defining creative and commercial conversations and breakthroughs – and somehow manage to do it all without lavishing half the day scrolling past a bunch of other people having a row.\n\nLanier has cast detailed doubt on whether most Twitter advocacy is even meaningfully effective, despite sometimes appearing to be so. If you spend your day caught up in online fighting, it’s preferable to tell yourself you’re involved in consciousness-raising for your cause. An alternative view is that you are simply obsessively polarising your particular debate, to the point where compromise – boring, unfashionable, yet historically always necessary – becomes a more distant possibility.\n\nMy “unpopular opinion”, in one of Twitter’s tellingly popular phrases, is that those who spend a significant amount of time arguing on it work for the platform and not for their cause. The Musk takeover at least makes it easier to see whose pocket you’re putting money into as you delude yourself you’re winning arguments. I’m certainly not saying I follow this rule, but in general I think arguing on the internet is like playing real tennis: even if you win, you’re still a twat.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5899b28a3a52d992407b1aa95d2689c2b1d4703f/0_273_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=e4d7eefe6e510bd81cf93360935a1d81', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:53'}

Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) and Mike Braun (R-Ind.) at an April 26 Senate Committee on Appropriations hearing.\n\n“As I said during my nomination hearing, the investigation is being run by and supervised by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware. He [David Weiss] is supervising the investigation, and I’m not at liberty to talk about internal DOJ deliberations—but he is in charge of that investigation, and there will not be interference of any political or improper kind,” Garland said, also declining to comment on whether other senior DOJ officials have been briefed.\n\nHagerty expressed skepticism at Garland’s promise, given recent statements from the White House regarding Hunter Biden’s innocence.\n\n“I wonder why the president is resorting to go to TV and … his surrogates. Earlier this month, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain said on TV that the president is confident that his son didn’t break the law, and the White House communications director said President Biden maintains his position that his son did nothing that was unethical,” Hagerty said.\n\nThe senator asked Garland whether U.S. President Joe Biden had told him his son is innocent.\n\n“Absolutely not,” Garland responded. “He has not done that, and he has committed to not interfere in the investigation.”\n\nHagerty pressed further, asking Garland how the public could be confident there won’t be political interference in the investigation.\n\n“Because we put a Trump appointee in charge of the investigation,” Garland said, referring to Weiss. “And because you have me as attorney general, who’s committed to the independence of the DOJ from any influence from the White House.”\n\nHagerty then asked Garland whether the DOJ was considering assigning a special counsel to investigate Hunter Biden. Garland again declined to comment.\n\nWhen asked under what circumstances a special counsel would be used in the investigation, Garland said, “it depends on the circumstances.”\n\nBraun asked similar questions about a potential special counsel and received similar responses.\n\n“The question is an internal DOJ matter,” Garland repeated. “I don’t want to make judgments, but I’m comfortable with the Attorney from Delaware continuing.”\n\nThe federal investigation into Hunter Biden’s finances was revealed in December 2020, and few updates have been provided since then.\n\nAttorney Clint Lancaster, who represented an Arkansas woman who filed the lawsuit in 2019 alleging that Hunter Biden was the father of her daughter Navy Joan Roberts, told CBS News earlier this month that federal prosecutors subpoenaed the documents from his case.\n\n“They wanted every record relating to Hunter Biden we had,” he said of the paternity case, which was settled in 2020.\n\nLancaster said the records included Hunter Biden’s “affidavit of financial means” during the paternity lawsuit. A financial affidavit is generally a statement showing income, expenses, assets, and liabilities.\n\nAdditionally, he said the tax records he and Roberts provided overlapped during the same time period as Hunter Biden’s foreign business activities.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/1.tagreuters.com2022binary_LYNXNPEI3510J-FILEDIMAGE-1200x833.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:47'}

Garland refused to reveal any internal deliberations against Hunter but noted the investigation is being run by David Weiss, a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nWeiss, a 20-year federal prosecutor, will have to determine if there is enough evidence to seek a federal grand jury indictment against Hunter Biden in an investigation that may end up including other members of the Biden family, such as Joe Biden’s brother James Biden, and potentially the president himself.\n\n“I’m aware of that, but he reports to you,” Hagerty pressed about the investigation under Weiss.\n\n“He is supervising the investigation and I’m not at liberty to talk about internal Justice Department deliberations, but he is in charge of that investigation,” Garland reiterated.\n\nGarland then promised the Biden administration would not interfere in the investigation. “There will not be interference of any political or improper kind.”\n\nHagerty continued his line of questioning by asking if Joe Biden ever told Garland that Hunter did not break any laws, including tax fraud, money laundering, and violation of lobbying laws.\n\n“Absolutely not. And the President has not done that. And the President is committed not to interfere, not only in that investigation but any other kind of investigation,” Garland claimed.\n\nLater in the hearing, Garland refused to say whether a special counsel should be placed over the investigation to maintain a just investigation. A special counsel would provide a degree of separation between Biden’s administration and the investigation. Legal experts have said a special counsel is necessary because Joe Biden has denied any wrongdoing by Hunter and may have influenced the ongoing investigation.\n\n“The question of whether they have a special counsel is one that is an internal decision-making within the department, so I don’t want to make any judgments one way or the other,” Garland responded. “But I’m quite comfortable with the United States attorney for that district continuing in the role that he’s [Weiss] playing.”\n\nDuring the 2020 presidential debate, Joe Biden claimed Hunter’s “laptop from hell” was a Russian plant “and a smear campaign.” Joe Biden has repeatedly claimed he was never involved in the family business.\n\nJoe Biden said the emails on Hunter’s laptop were a “Russian plant” and “a smear campaign.” Today new emails indicate that Biden was PAYING Hunter’s bills for a deal with a Chinese government-controlled entity. pic.twitter.com/K3Ojf3SyIg — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) April 26, 2022\n\nBut according to White House visitor logs obtained by the New York Post on Saturday, Hunter’s corrupt business partner, Eric Schwerin, met with Joe Biden at the White House 19 times between 2009 and 2015. Joe Biden was vice president during this time. The contact between Joe Biden and Schwerin directly contradicts Joe Biden’s repeated claims he was never involved in the family business. The Post’s reporting adds a twelfth instance Joe Biden has been involved in the family’s business scheme.\n\nDOOCY: "The President has said that he never spoke to his son about his overseas business dealings. Is that still the case?"

Sixty percent say Hunter Biden has sold “influence and access” to Joe Biden. The poll also shows 67 percent believe Joe Biden should be impeached if he “secretly participated and facilitated” in the family’s business.\n\nText messages from 2019 on Hunter’s “laptop from hell” depict the Biden family payout mechanism. The instrument indicates a collection of 50 percent of familial salaries for 30 years.\n\n“I hope you all can do what I did and pay for everything for this entire family for 30 years,” Hunter texted to his daughter in 2019. “It’s really hard. But don’t worry, unlike Pop [Joe], I won’t make you give me half your salary.”\n\nThe Biden’s family payment mechanism of collecting 50 percent of family salaries for 30 years could be legal “predicates” for racketeering charges, according to former Utah U.S. attorney Brett Tolman.\n\nFollow Wendell Husebø on Twitter and Gettr @WendellHusebø.

Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.) told reporters following the meeting.\n\n“We are in a different position now than we were in the past,” he said. “There’s ample vaccines available. There is the ability to test and quarantine that work. And so, Title 42 should be lifted, and that we should focus on border management policy in order to make sure that they have the resources in order to move forward.”\n\nBut the administration’s plans to stop enforcing Title 42 were thrown into doubt as the meeting came to a close. A Trump-appointed federal judge in Louisiana said he planned to block the administration’s plans for rescinding the public health order, a win for a group of GOP-led states who sued to stop Biden from moving forward.\n\nThe meeting punctuated internal disagreement in the Democratic Party around the Biden administration’s decision to end enforcement of the Title 42 authority, a public health order that allows border officials to speedily turn away migrants at the U.S. southern border.\n\nImmigration advocates have a litany of concerns about the policy, but at the center of those issues is that it allows officials to forego asylum screenings, blocking persecuted migrants from exercising a right they have under U.S. law.\n\nWhile many support the Biden administration’s decision and indeed wish it had come sooner, others have expressed concern about the plans amid a prolonged spike in border crossings.\n\n“Yes they’re listening to the immigration activists, but my question is who’s listening to the men and women in green and in blue and, more importantly, who is listening to the border communities – the sheriffs, the landowners, the rest of the people who live on the border?” Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), who represents a border community and has raised concerns about the policy decision, said on “Fox News Sunday.”\n\nRep. Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.), who was tasked with presenting the group’s position on Title 42 to Biden, said the meeting touched on a series of issues before turning to immigration, an issue that still led coverage of the meeting.\n\n“The reality is when you talk to Latinos they’re talking about the economy, jobs, air pollution, and so the media is talking about things that are divisive,” said Barragán.\n\nBarragán added that the CHC puts more blame over the immigration policy crisis on former President Trump than on Biden.\n\n“The bottom line is this president walked into a tough situation with a prior administration who dismantled the legal immigration system,” she said.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the meeting was part of Biden’s outreach to individual congressional caucuses. Biden has recently met with the Congressional Progressive Caucus as well as other groups in Congress.\n\nAttendees said that it also covered the implementation of the bipartisan infrastructure law, immigration reform, and environmental justice.\n\nAt one point, an aide to the president walked into the room with a note saying the 30-minute meeting had gone on for 62 minutes.\n\nBiden, rather than keep the information to himself, read the note out loud to laughter from the attendees.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House is facing pressure from immigration advocates to forcefully oppose a bill that has attracted support from moderate senators that would delay an end to the enforcement of Title 42. The White House has not taken a position on the legislation.\n\n“I just wish that the Biden administration would stand up and explain what it’s doing and own it,” said Clara Long, associate director at Human Rights Watch who focuses on immigration and border policy.\n\nPsaki again on Monday said it would be up to Congress to make any changes to CDC’s Title 42 enforcement, but she declined to say whether Biden would sign legislation that did so.\n\n“This would be Congress having the discussion. We are continuing to prepare for a May 23 implementation,” Psaki said. “There will be a range of conversations about this over the coming days.”\n\nThe lawsuits filed by GOP-led states seem to be the biggest immediate threat to the administration’s plans. Some have speculated that the White House would like to see the courts thwart their plans in order to take a hot-button political issue off Biden’s plate.\n\n“I think there’s a theory going around that they’re hoping the courts give them a get-out-of-jail-free card,” said Long.\n\nBiden’s approval ratings are particularly low on his handling of immigration.\n\nA Politico/Morning Consult poll conducted earlier this month found that 54 percent of registered voters oppose Biden’s decision to lift Title 42.\n\nBut a different poll conducted in February by Impact Research for the National Immigration Law Center found that 52 percent of likely 2022 voters support ending Title 42 enforcement.\n\nStill, most CHC members believe that the administration can push forward with its vision of border policy, because Republicans are unlikely to relent from attacking Biden on immigration and the border.\n\n“No matter what the president does, they’re going to make noise. The president and the Democratic-controlled Congress have done amazing things, that’s why econ has improved,” said Rep. Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.), who attended the meeting.\n\n“Republicans don’t want to focus on the glass that’s half full, they want to convince us the glass is half empty,” he added.\n\nSome advocates for ending the policy, which they say represented one prong of the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant agenda, argue that Democrats are risking turning off their base by voicing support for continuing the policy.\n\n“This is a policy that can help you win and the flipside of that is embracing the Republican talking points is not going to help you win those Democratic voters that you desperately need to turn out for you in November,” said Bri Gillis, political director of the National Immigration Law Center’s Immigrant Justice Fund.\n\nStill, some Democrats say the discussion of Title 42 is moot.\n\n“There’s nothing to debate, you’re either for Title 42 or you’re not,” said Rep. Lou Correa (D-Calif.), a CHC member who did not attend the meeting.\n\n“Everybody’s talking abt Title 42 when that’s not the issue. The real issue is American industrial might, nearshoring of American jobs from China, creating a stronger manufacturing base, and a lot of that relies on immigrants. And we’re talking about Title 42. Doesn’t even come close to addressing the bigger public policy issues in this country and that’s what everybody’s talking about. And it’s hurting us,” said Correa.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/ruizraul_031821gn_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:41'}

They stole this election. We all know. They will destroy our country next.”\n\nThe message about Trump potentially invoking martial law, earlier reported by CNN on Monday and confirmed by the Guardian, came a month after the idea had been raised in a heated Oval Office meeting a month before, where Trump considered ways to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nMeadows did not appear to respond to Greene’s text. But the messages Trump’s top White House aide was receiving shows the extraordinary ideas swirling around Trump after he and his operatives were unable to stop the certification of Biden’s election win on January 6.\n\nGreene – one of Trump’s fiercest far-right defenders on Capitol Hill – also texted Meadows days before the Capitol attack asking about how to prepare for objections to Biden’s win at the joint session of Congress, the text messages show.\n\n“Good morning Mark, I’m here in DC. We have to get organized for the 6th,” Greene wrote on 31 December. “I would like to meet with Rudy Giuliani again. We didn’t get to speak with him long. Also anyone who can help. We are getting a lot of members on board.”\n\nThat text message from Greene, who had not yet been sworn in as a member of Congress, a week before the Capitol attack also underscores her close relationship with the Trump White House and an extraordinary level of coordination to obstruct Biden being certified as president.\n\nBut the text messages that Meadows did not turn over to the select committee – as opposed to the communications he agreed to produce for the investigation – were perhaps more notable as the panel investigates connections between the White House and the Capitol attack.\n\nThe panel is aware, for instance, that Meadows had contacts through December 2020 and January 2021 with organizers of the Save America rally at the Ellipse that descended into the Capitol attack as well as with Trump campaign officials, say sources close to the inquiry.\n\nYet none of the text messages Meadows produced to the select committee through a cooperation deal agreed last year and in response to a subpoena show any such contacts, raising the specter that he might have deliberately withheld some communications.\n\nThe former White House chief of staff appears to have ultimately turned over no text messages between 9 December and 21 December, a critical time period in the lead-up to the Capitol attack during which a number of key moments took place.\n\nMeadows appeared to be aware of efforts by the White House and others, for instance, to send fake Trump slates of electors to Congress. The idea was to have “dueling” slates of electors force then-vice president Mike Pence to discount those votes and return Trump to office.\n\nThat scheme – which the select committee believes was coordinated in part by the Trump White House, the sources said – appeared to occur on 14 December, the deadline under the Electoral Count Act for states to send electoral college votes to Congress.\n\nMeadows also was in close contact with Trump’s attorney Rudy Giuliani and others after the contentious Oval Office meeting with Trump on 18 December, as he sought to bar onetime Trump campaign lawyer and conspiracy theorist Sidney Powell from the White House.\n\nBut Meadows appears to have turned over no text messages from that crucial period, as allies of the former president started to set their sights on January 6, including the Stop the Steal movement that started to plan a protest at the Capitol around that time.\n\nThe seeming omission may be explained in part by the fact that Meadows was communicating about those plans on his personal cell phone – against which the select committee issued a subpoena contested by Meadows in federal court as “overly broad”.\n\nThe absence of messages between 9 December and 21 December may also be explained more straightforwardly by the fact that Meadows did not receive any messages during that period. Meadows’ lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nHouse investigators are not convinced they have been given all the text messages relevant to their subpoena, according to one source with knowledge of the matter, and expect to continue pursuing Meadows’ documents and personal communications in court.\n\nIn a motion for summary judgment with respect to Meadows’ records, the select committee said in a 248-page court filing late on Friday that it believed Meadows’ claims for withholding material from the investigation on grounds of executive privilege were baseless.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfe079c4faec28229651078fa1ef1445f13623c9/0_149_4504_2704/master/4504.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bb0615f20d2d295d9c507d24a68b0912', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:54'}

When former President Trump, 75, was hospitalized with COVID-19 in October 2020, he was at much higher risk, given his age and the lack of available vaccines. Trump has said he has since been vaccinated and boosted.\n\nWhite House officials have said that they expect Biden will catch the virus, but he has not been avoiding events with crowds. He is scheduled to attend the White House Correspondents Assn. dinner Saturday and to speak at a memorial service Sunday for former Vice President Walter Mondale in Minneapolis.\n\n“Like many Americans, he makes risk assessments,” Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.\n\nHarris had initially planned to return to Washington from California, where she took some personal time and gave a speech about anti-satellite missiles and another about maternal health, on Tuesday. Her office would not say why she altered her travel plans to return a day earlier but noted that she was not experiencing any symptoms before testing positive.\n\nBecause she had not been expected in Washington until Tuesday, Harris had a light schedule, with no meetings in the morning and no public events all day, said Allen, the spokeswoman.\n\nHarris took a rapid antigen test Tuesday morning after going to work at the White House, Allen said. After that test came back positive, Allen said, Harris took a PCR test, a more accurate assessment that confirmed the rapid result. Harris left the White House for her residence at the U.S. Naval Observatory by motorcade.\n\nBiden and Harris later spoke by phone. “He wanted to check in and make sure she has everything she needs as she quarantines at home,” the White House said in a statement.\n\nThough Harris did not attend any formal meetings, the White House is still tracing her contacts to determine who may have been exposed to her. Even when they are not in formal meetings, vice presidents interact with an array of policy, communications and personal staff.\n\n“Should we identify a close a close contact, we will notify them as appropriate,” Allen said.\n\nHer office is also going through her schedule to see which public events and private meetings need to be canceled or shifted to a virtual setting.\n\nHarris plans to work from her residence for at least five days and will not return to the White House until she receives a negative test. Allen declined to say whether Harris would be taking any medication, adding that such decisions would be left to White House physicians.\n\nThe latest wave of COVID, sparked by the Omicron BA. 2 subvariants, has swept through official Washington in recent weeks, infecting many members of Congress and the executive branch. The White House rhetoric has shifted from preventing infections to promoting vaccines, boosters and therapeutics.\n\n“It is going to be hard to ensure that no one gets COVID in America,” Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House’s coronavirus coordinator, told reporters Tuesday. “That’s not even a policy. The goal of our policy should be obviously to minimize infections whenever possible, but to make sure people don’t get seriously ill. The best ways of doing that are make sure people are vaccinated and boosted as the vice president is and making sure we have plenty of therapeutics.”\n\nMinutes after Harris announced her result, two Democratic members of the Senate — Ron Wyden of Oregon and Chris Murphy of Connecticut — announced they too had contracted what they believed to be mild forms of the virus.\n\n“It’s a bummer, but I’m sure if I wasn’t fully vaccinated I would be feeling a lot worse. So remember to get your booster!” Murphy tweeted.\n\nSimmons, Harris’ communications director, tested positive for the virus after attending the April 2 Gridiron dinner, a traditional white-tie gathering of reporters and politicians that features light roasts and songs.\n\nAtty. Gen. Merrick Garland and Gina Raimondo, the secretary of Commerce, announced positive test results following the dinner, as did Reps. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank) and Joaquin Castro (D-Texas).\n\nAll of them had been vaccinated, and none became seriously ill.\n\nHarris’ positive tests come as the administration has tried to push the country toward normalcy, eliminating mask requirements in many settings and returning to public gatherings. A federal judge in Florida took it a step further last week, overturning a federal requirement to wear masks on airplanes, trains and buses. The administration is appealing that ruling.\n\n“None of us can predict with any certainty where exactly this pandemic is going, what the virus is going to do next. All we can do is prepare,” Jha said, urging Congress to pass another round of funding to combat the virus.\n\nStaff writer Eli Stokols contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n', 'image': 'https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ab3b3ac/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffb%2Fff%2Fcfc38a794c329c2a8d3684ababb9%2F947026-na-pol-0421-vp-cali-trip-kkn-25884.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:57'}

He tested positive on March 15, which lead to a flurry of questions over Harris’s contact and if she should be wearing a mask around the president and others. She continued to test negative during Emhoff’s stint with the coronavirus.\n\nTwo Democratic senators also tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday: Chris Murphy (Conn.) and Ron Wyden (Ore.).\n\nEarlier this month, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) had the coronavirus, as did Attorney General Merrick Garland.\n\nThe White House recently first acknowledged that Biden could get COVID-19 amid the uptick in positive cases surrounding the president earlier this month.\n\n“I wouldn’t say it’s just a matter of time, but I of course it is possible that the president, like every other American, could get COVID,” Jha said on Tuesday. “There is no 100 percent anything.”\n\nPsaki was asked to respond to a hypothetical question about the line of succession if Biden were to also get COVID-19 and both he and Harris become “very ill.”\n\n“Well, technically the Speaker of the House is the third in line. So, there you go. No, I’m just confirming that for you. It is true, as we’ve noted many times, it is possible the president could test positive. We will be very transparent with you if that were to happen,” Psaki said.\n\nShe added though that she thinks Biden would be able to continue his presidential duties if he were to test positive.\n\n“He has access to the best health care in the world, and we believe, because of all the precautions and steps we have taken that he would be able to continue his duties, as the vice president is as well as vice president,” she said.\n\nOfficials stress that he is vaccinated, and Psaki said last week last week that it wouldn’t be a failure of the precautions in place to protect Biden if he were to get the virus.\n\nPsaki on Tuesday told reporters not to expect updates to protocols, including masking protocols, within the White House in light of Harris’ positive test.\n\nShe noted there is a regular testing cadence for the president and vice president, as well as officials around them, and that there is social distancing in meetings and a number of aides choose to wear masks.\n\nUpdated at 4:09 p.m.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/harriskamala_031522_ap_manuel_balce_ceneta.jpeg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:41'}

The former House member, who is the first bisexual member of the Senate, 'joked with Democrats about how easy it was for her to charm Republican men,' according to the book.\n\n'Sinema, a fitness enthusiast who was 36 when she entered Congress, boasted knowingly to colleagues and aides that her cleavage had an extraordinary persuasive effect on the uptight men of the GOP. She told one House Republican that while she would never switch parties, her father would be delighted if she did,' the authors write.\n\nSen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) 'boasted knowingly to colleagues and aides that her cleavage had an extraordinary persuasive effect on the uptight men of the GOP,' according to a new book\n\nThe book also delves into President Joe Biden's governing woes – including prolonged talks with Sinema, whom the authors dub an 'aloof Arizonan.' She became a progressive nemesis when she and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) wouldn't go along with Biden's multi-trillion proposals, although she did cheer his infrastructure plan.\n\nAfter Biden signed the infrastructure bill, Sinema asked Biden's aides not to send the president to her home state for a 'victory lap,' even though he had won Arizona in 2020. White House aides were concluding she was 'simply a difficult person.'\n\nThe book describes one early 2021 dinner with Senate Republicans after the election where where the Republicans asked Sinema to join – and she requested to be able to enter through a back door to avoid being seen.\n\nShe has won praise from Republicans for her opposition to changing the Senate filibuster, and a line of Republicans congratulated her on the Senate floor after voting with the GOP on a move to advance the Democratic leadership backed voting rights legislation.\n\nThe book, which grabbed headlines with revelations about House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, also contains details about former President Donald Trump and his election overturn effort.\n\nSinema confounded Democrats during months-long negotiations\n\nSinema previously served in the House. Here, she and Trey Hollingsworth, R-Ind., talk before a House Financial Services Committee hearing in 2018\n\nSinema asked Biden's aides not to send the president to her home state for a 'victory lap' after Biden signed the infrastructure bill, according to the book\n\nTrump's belief that he could prevail extended well after the time he left the White House and decamped to Mar-a-Lago.\n\nAnd it wasn't just Donald Trump's most passionate adherents who believed in the 'reinstatement' myth – the former President himself was saying last spring he would be reinstalled within months, the book reveals.\n\nTrump stated his belief in the theory in May of 2021, four months after leaving office, according to the book.\n\nThe idea of a Trump reinstatement was being promoted at the time by My Pillow exec Mike Lindell and QAnon adherents, although it would ultimately be believed by nearly a third of Republicans in a June Politico / Morning Consult survey.\n\nTrump phoned National Review editor Rich Lowry to tell him that the magazine 'would take off like a rocket if it recognized that he had actually won the election,' according to the book.\n\n'In fact, Trump told Lowry, he expected to be reinstated by August, and Republicans would be put back in charge of the Senate once the supposedly pervasive corruption of the 2020 election was exposed.'\n\nFormer President Donald Trump told columnist Rich Lowry in May 2021 he expected to be reinstated within months, according to a new book\n\nThe Senate had flipped to Democratic control in 2000 after two Democratic wins in Georgia.\n\nThere is no provision in the Constitution for 'reinstatement' once election results have been certified by the states and Congress has counted the electoral votes and the president and lawmakers have been sworn into office.\n\n(Lowry may have been an odd target for Trump's lobbying. He had called the Capitol riot in a Jan. 6th column a 'disgrace,' where he wrote that 'one point of the riot was to further pressure Pence (“Hang Mike Pence!”), but much of the lobbying took place behind closed doors, among Trump’s advisers.')\n\nTrump also took a shot at now Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. 'It was beyond belief, Trump said, that Mitch McConnell did not seem to understand this,' according to the book.\n\n'The president's comments were pure madness,' the authors write.\n\nCongress ultimately counted the votes certified by the states following the Capitol riot.

Mo Brooks, Brooks released a statement saying Trump had approached him with the idea.\n\n'President Trump asked me to rescind the 2020 elections, immediately remove Joe Biden from the White House, immediately put President Trump back in the White House, and hold a new special election for the presidency,' Brooks said in a statement.\n\n'As a lawyer, I’ve repeatedly advised President Trump that January 6 was the final election contest verdict and neither the U.S. Constitution nor the U.S. Code permit what President Trump asks. Period,' he added.\n\n'I’ve told President Trump the truth knowing full well that it might cause President Trump to rescind his endorsement. But I took a sworn oath to defend and protect the U.S. Constitution. I honor my oath. That is the way I am. I break my sworn oath for no man.'\n\nTrump took back his endorsement in the Alabama Senate primary, citing Brooks' call for people to put the 2020 election 'behind you.'\n\nLindell, who was advised Trump inside the White House in the last days of his presidency, has also repeatedly touted the idea.\n\nOther passages in the book reveal how Vice President Kamala Harris quickly learned not to come between President Biden and his negotiations with Congress.\n\nThe authors recount one episode where the president snapped at her so harshly even Republican senators in the meeting were shocked.\n\nIn a meeting last May, Biden tried to persuade Republican lawmakers to support $1 trillion in infrastructure spending.\n\nAnd while Biden was ready for a compromise, Harris thought the bill was skimpy.\n\n'Harris thought that there was something missing from the conversation,' according to the book.\n\nShe began turning the conversation toward Democratic priorities, including family and social spending, which were originally included in the larger Build Back Better bill.\n\nShe 'began to make the case for a larger package than the one Republicans seemed to have in mind.'\n\n'Biden dismissed her comment immediately,' the authors wrote, in so harsh a tone 'that even the Republican senators were taken aback.'\n\nBiden was typically 'scrupulously respectful' of his second-in-command, but the moment revealed that infrastructure negotiations were his and his alone.", 'image': 'https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/26/17/57074033-0-image-a-35_1650989503049.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:57:00'}

After news of Musk’s takeover, news website Politico contacted several top Republican members and aides to gauge reaction to a potential Trump Twitter return.\n\n“Every single one of them told us that they hoped the former president stays the hell away from Twitter,” Politico reported.\n\nTrump himself has said he won’t be back, telling Fox News: “I am going to be staying on Truth.”\n\nThe twice-impeached former commander-in-chief is not known for his consistency, however. He has reportedly expressed discontent with how Truth Social has performed – “What the fuck is going on,” the Daily Beast reported Trump as asking aides in March – and to return to relevance, and to win back the spotlight he craves, the former president might need Twitter.\n\n“If he wants to intervene on behalf of a candidate he has now endorsed in the midterm elections, being able to reach that number of people with messages supporting those candidates is a way of essentially getting free advertising time to reach people who are more likely to vote as a result of getting a signal from Donald Trump,” Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, told Time.\n\nTrump may have insisted that he will snub Twitter and stick with Truth Social, but his commitment to his own platform has so far been tepid at best – Trump has posted on Truth Social just once.\n\nIf that lack of interaction hasn’t helped Truth Social, neither did the botched rollout on 21 February. Tens of thousands of people were unable to access the network – the Guardian was finally allowed in on 5 March – and by early April the Truth Social app was the 355th most popular on Apple devices.\n\nIn terms of daily active users, Truth Social had 513,000, the Daily Beast reported. Twitter has about 217 million.\n\nLack of usage – both by Trump and by the general public – is not the only problem the new network faces.\n\nShares in Digital World Acquisition Corporation, the firm which plans to merge with Trump Media & Technology Group, dropped 13% on Monday after news of Musk’s deal. Since Musk became the largest shareholder in Twitter TMTG shares have fallen by 44% overall, and two key Truth Social executives quit the platform in April.\n\nSince Trump was removed from Twitter his missives have been limited to email blasts sent from his Save America Pac, the messages frequently bleating about a “stolen election” in 2020. At the moment those emails are received by a mixture of supporters and vaguely interested journalists.\n\nIf Trump resumed tweeting, he’d have a far bigger audience for his misinformation – which could have serious consequences.\n\n“The real danger would come after election day,” Gertz said, “when he could use that same megaphone to spread lies about voter fraud as a pretext for overturning elections. If that happens, another January 6 – perhaps a more successful one – is very much in play.”', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a92109698abfe8cebc8ed79f918f6e0cb5a652cf/0_156_5131_3078/master/5131.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0c9734ab4bdc644afa8fecabe2eaf914', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:03'}

Those measures aim to make the services more appealing to advertisers seeking a safe venue, and to better accommodate politicians and regulators arguing that the platforms are responsible for all of their content. But the moves have alienated some users who, like Mr. Musk, say they go overboard.\n\nHow Twitter operates won’t be entirely up to Mr. Musk.\n\n“Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules—regardless of their shareholding,” Thierry Breton, the EU regulator, wrote Tuesday on Twitter. “Mr Musk knows this well.”\n\nMr. Breton expressed confidence that Twitter, under Mr. Musk’s ownership, would conform to the bloc’s new rules, which still need formal approval from the EU Parliament and representatives from EU countries.\n\nMr. Musk’s planned changes at Twitter, and the response, will be closely watched. Twitter is smaller and less profitable than other social-media companies. It claims 217 million so-called monetizable daily users compared with 1.9 billion daily users for Meta Platforms Inc.’s core Facebook platform and a billion-plus monthly users for TikTok. But Twitter users include media personalities, politicians, activists and tech aficionados who help shape social discourse.\n\n“It has influence way beyond its user base and way beyond its valuation, and so we care about it,” said David Kaye, former United Nations special rapporteur focused on free speech and now a law professor at the University of California, Irvine.\n\nTwitter’s existing content policies haven’t brought about huge financial success; it has struggled to deliver consistent profits. Photo: Laura Morton for The Wall Street Journal\n\nMr. Musk, chief executive of Tesla Inc. and Space Exploration Technologies Corp. as well as the world’s richest person, is one of Twitter’s most prominent users, employing the platform for everything from promoting his companies to battling rivals and critics. In Monday’s deal announcement, he said he wants to open up Twitter’s algorithms to public scrutiny, “defeat” spammers and authenticate users’ identities.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Musk said he views “free speech” as that permitted by the law—a far broader definition of what is allowable than most major social networks have adopted. “I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law,” he said in a tweet. “If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect. Therefore, going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people.”\n\nSome industry executives and analysts say Mr. Musk is in for an awakening. Reversing Twitter’s efforts risks stoking advertisers’ worries about the placement of their ads, potentially pushing them toward competitors like Snap Inc. and Meta, said Ben Black, co-head of internet research at Deutsche Bank.\n\nElon Musk struck a deal on Monday to buy Twitter for about $44 billion, moving the world’s richest man a step closer to taking control of the social-media platform. Photo: Ryan Lash/TED Conferences, LLC/AFP via Getty Images\n\n“Do you really want to have your Mercedes-Benz commercial against a beheading?” he said. “If someone falls overboard on a cruise ship, do you want your vacation message being advertised against that content?” He said less moderation could also drive away some users, potentially slowing growth.\n\n“‘Do you really want to have your Mercedes-Benz commercial against a beheading?’” — Ben Black, co-head of internet research at Deutsche Bank\n\nIn the company’s early years, Twitter executives were loath to remove content unless it broke local laws. The platform often took a hands-off approach even to content from officially designated terrorist groups, drawing criticism from researchers, lawmakers and victims’ families.\n\nIt stepped up moderation over the years, removing accounts connected to the terrorist group ISIS in 2014, for example. That accelerated during and after the 2016 U.S. presidential race, which saw a jump in complaints about white nationalists and others using the platform to attack and harass minority users.\n\nOther industry leaders who favored looser policies, including Meta co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, have gradually embraced more intervention. Platforms including Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest Inc. and Reddit Inc. all have added staff or bolstered rules to monitor their content, though each draws the lines differently.\n\nTheir efforts target a range of potentially problematic content, from hate speech and false information about elections to what they see as fringe views on health, along with other issues the platforms consider harmful. Pinterest recently banned posts that it deems to contain misinformation about climate change.\n\nTwitter and other platforms also have systems allowing users to report claims of abuse by other users, which can lead to account suspensions that some of those involved say can be arbitrary or unfair.\n\nMore moderating has required complex, and often confusing, guidelines for employees and users. Such efforts have led to some divisive decisions, including bans by Twitter and Facebook of then-President Donald Trump for posts encouraging the rioters who attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, seeking to halt certification of President Biden’s electoral victory.\n\nThose bans were widely praised on the left and by some Republicans. But Mr. Trump and his supporters blasted it and have backed rival social-media apps with fewer restrictions that so far have gained limited traction, including Parler, Gab, and Gettr, which former Trump adviser Jason Miller launched last year.\n\nMany in the Trump camp have voiced support for Mr. Musk’s planned Twitter acquisition, though Mr. Trump told Fox News on Monday that he doesn’t plan to return to the platform and would instead use his social-media startup, Truth Social.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up Technology A weekly digest of tech reviews, headlines, columns and your questions answered by WSJ's Personal Tech gurus. PREVIEW\n\nDevin Nunes, CEO of Truth Social, lauded Monday’s Twitter deal, though he said he doesn’t see the platform, even under Mr. Musk, as a direct competitor because of their different target audiences. “This is a great, great day,” the Trump ally and former GOP congressman said. “Finally we’re getting some movement in the right direction here in terms of opening the internet back up and giving people their voice back.”\n\nTwitter’s existing policies haven’t brought about huge financial success; it has struggled to deliver consistent profits. And losing advertisers might not be a problem for Mr. Musk. He has said he wants the platform to rely less on advertising—which accounts for about 90% of its revenue, totaling $5.1 billion last year—and to focus more on a subscription business model. The platform currently offers Twitter Blue, a $2.99-a-month subscription service that gives customers access to premium features.\n\nDespite Mr. Trump’s comments Monday, many observers and Twitter employees are focused on Mr. Musk’s handling of the former president’s account as a potential indicator of his plans. During an all-hands meeting on Monday, Twitter CEO Parag Agarwal was asked if the company might reinstate Mr. Trump once Mr. Musk’s ownership is completed. Mr. Agarwal said it wasn’t clear.\n\n—Patience Haggin contributed to this article.\n\nElon Musk and Twitter More coverage of the billionaire's bid for Twitter, selected by editors Latest Developments\n\nWrite to Deepa Seetharaman at Deepa.Seetharaman@wsj.com and Meghan Bobrowsky at Meghan.Bobrowsky@wsj.com", 'image': 'https://images.wsj.net/im-531039/social', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:07'}

He said that the book describes how “populist economic nationalism has arrived as a movement and why we need to embrace it.”\n\nIn 2021, Navarro published the book “In Trump Time: A Journal of America’s Plague Year,” which was ranked as a top-10 bestseller by USA Today and has been a bestseller on Amazon. Navarro previously noted that more than 200,000 copies of “In Trump Time” had been pre-sold, according to distributors, before it was available to the public.\n\nHowever, “In Trump Time” was omitted from The New York Times’ non-fiction bestseller list even though it should have been ranked at least third on the list from Nov. 21, 2021, Navarro said at the time, citing statistics published by Bookscan, the definitive industry source used for book rankings.\n\n“The New York Times in its cancel culture, virtue signaling, fascist world, did not put it on the list,” Navarro told The Epoch Times. “And that had a material harm to the sales of the book because people use that New York Times bestseller list as what we call in economics a ‘signal’ as to whether a book is worthy of purchase. So there was a great grassroots performance by the book itself. But my judgment, if we weren’t in a cancel culture world, we probably would have sold a million copies of that book.”\n\nIn response to Navarro’s allegations, Nicole Taylor, a communications director at The New York Times, told The Epoch Times in an email that the publication’s best-seller lists are “based on a detailed analysis of book sales from a wide range of retailers who provide us with specific and confidential context of their sales each week.”\n\nThe New York Times representative added that “sales data from our confidential panel of reporting stores is separate from what is reported to Bookscan or other entities” and that publication’s “Best Sellers department has reviewed the data they received for the sales week of November 21, 2021 and is confident in the accuracy of the Best-Seller Lists for that week.”\n\nNavarro, in an email response, called The New York Times’ statement a “misdirection,” saying that “In Trump Time” sold over 30,000 books during the week in question. “We sold twice as many books or more as half of the titles that appeared on the list,” he said.\n\nThe former official announced “Taking Back Trump’s America,” which is scheduled for release in September, while guest-hosting Stephen K. Bannon’s “War Room” podcast on April 15, and said “hands down the ‘War Room’ is the most powerful platform to sell thoughtful books to the American public. It really astonishes people, authors, publishers, when they go on the road and see how lettered the audience is.”\n\n“I’m counting also on publications like The Epoch Times,” he said. “My hope is that avid readers of The Epoch Times will embrace ‘Taking Back Trump’s America.’”\n\nNavarro revealed that The Epoch Times will be included in the book, saying, “I talk about The Epoch Times in glowing terms in the ‘Taking Back Trump’s America’ book with respect to how it’s grown rapidly from what was a niche publication to one of the most important international newspapers in the world.”\n\nThe former official projected large gains for the Republicans in November’s midterms, driven by growing dissatisfaction with what he described as increasingly radical Democratic policies.\n\n“I think a safe bet is a 60-seat swing [in favor of the Republican Party], which is similar to what happened to Obama with the Tea Party [movement] and when [Newt] Gingrich came along [in the 1994 midterm elections], but depending on how redistricting goes around the country, that could go as high as 80 and as low as 30 or 40,” Navarro said.\n\n“I think a large portion of the country now is united against the Democrat Party,” he added, describing its performance as showing that “it’s a radical political party.”\n\n“It’s really out of touch in the center of this country.”\n\nDespite Republican Party advantages heading into the midterms, Navarro noted that there are struggles between globalists and nationalists happening within the party.\n\n“It’s also true that there’s an important war going on now within the Republican Party between the party of Davos, Wall Street, multinational corporations that offshore our jobs versus the Trump Republicans who embrace secure borders, embrace fair rather than simply so-called free trade,” he said. “If we simply have a Republican majority with the current leadership in charge, Mitch McConnell in the Senate, Kevin McCarthy in the House, we’re going to have basically the status quo ante, and it will not serve the center of this country.”\n\nNavarro emphasized the distinction between “RINO,” an acronym for “Republican in Name Only,” and “Trump” Republicans.\n\n“The Karl Rove faction, the Wall Street faction, the Liz Cheney faction … Mitch McConnell, [Kevin] McCarthy, they’re all supporting RINO Republicans rather than Trump Republicans,” he said, adding that the Republican primaries will serve as a critical test to determine which camp prevails.\n\nA primary race that Navarro is particularly interested in is the Republican primary race in South Carolina’s 1st Congressional District between Trump-endorsed Katie Arrington and first-term incumbent Nancy Mace. Following the events of Jan. 6, 2021, and in what was her first speech on the floor of the House of Representatives, Mace, who had worked on the 2016 Trump campaign, blamed the president for the breach of the Capitol. A story was also posted to her official Congressional website that included “Mace Condemns President Trump” in the headline.\n\nMace is a poster child for the RINO, Rove, corporate media effort to stop the Trump movement,” Navarro told The Epoch Times. Trump endorsed primary challenger Katie Arrington in February, calling Mace “an absolutely terrible candidate” who “has been very disloyal to the Republican Party.”\n\nWhen reached for comment, Austin McCubbin, manager for Rep. Mace’s congressional campaign wrote in an e-mailed statement, “Conservative organizations all score Mace as having a near perfect voting record, because she doesn’t sacrifice her principles.”\n\nNavarro, in response, said in an email, “I was in the trenches with Katie Arrington in the Trump administration when we were fighting to save millions of lives at the start of the pandemic and she was a warrior.”\n\n“The only thing you need to know about Mace is she supported the Democrats effort to steal the election from Donald Trump,” he added.\n\nExecutive Privilege\n\nNavarro described how he is protecting executive privilege in the face of intense pressure from the Democrat-majority House committee investigating the events of Jan. 6.\n\nThe Trump aide refused to comply with a subpoena from the House committee, citing executive privilege. In a highly partisan vote this month, the House of Representatives voted to formally ask the Justice Department to prosecute Navarro and another top Trump adviser on criminal contempt charges for not complying with the subpoena.\n\nAfter the November 2020 presidential election when Trump and allies, including Navarro, alleged largescale election irregularities and fraud, Navarro coordinated what he calls the “Green Bay Sweep” strategy with Trump and Stephen Bannon, who previously served as Trump’s chief White House strategist. The Green Bay Sweep Strategy, named after a football play made famous by the Green Bay Packers, involved members of Congress formally contesting election results in six battleground states before the certification of presidential election results on Jan. 6.\n\nNavarro writes in his book “In Trump Time” regarding Jan. 6, “The political and legal beauty of the strategy was this: by law, both the House of Representatives and the Senate must spend up to two hours of debate per state on each requested challenge. For the six battleground states, that would add up to as much as twenty-four hours of nationally televised hearings across the two chambers of Congress. Through these televised proceedings, we would finally be able to short-circuit the crushing censorship of the anti-Trump media and take our case directly to the American people.”\n\nHe also writes of the event, “The goal is not to get the election overturned today. The goal is to subject the ballots—the legal votes of American citizens along with what we believe to be a flood of illegal ballots—to careful scrutiny and investigation.”\n\nNavarro explained his reasons for maintaining privilege during the House committee proceedings, and suggested that the matter may ultimately have to be resolved by the Supreme Court.\n\n“President Trump has asserted executive privilege, number one,” Navarro told The Epoch Times. “Number two, I informed the [House January 6] committee very clearly that it was not my privilege to waive, therefore I could not comply with their subpoena. And I directed them—and this is equally important—I directed them to negotiate directly with [Trump] and his attorneys for any partial or full waiver of the privilege, and then I would be happy to comply if President Trump himself or his attorneys negotiated something with them. It’s not my privilege to waive.”\n\nHe added, “Subsequent to that, the committee colluded either explicitly or tacitly with the Biden White House to do an end run around that direction, and they chose to have Biden take the legal step of waiving President Trump’s privilege in this matter. And that’s where things stand. So, there’s going to be ongoing legal activities related to that … But this is a Supreme Court decision waiting to happen, because the [House Jan. 6] committee itself is acting in an illegal manner.”\n\nThe White House and the House Jan. 6 committee did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nNavarro in late 2020 completed a report, “The Navarro Report,” documenting detailed evidence and statistical receipts of widespread election fraud and irregularities in the 2020 presidential election. He noted this report has never been discredited, despite Democrats and others maintaining that there was no election fraud.\n\n“The central premise of the Jan. 6 committee is that the election was fair. And they simply assert that there was no fraud or irregularities,” Navarro said. “The problem with that is that there is abundant evidence to the contrary, starting with a very extensive and extensively referenced three-volume report I did that explains what that fraud and what those irregularities were, and how and why the Democrats were able to pull off essentially what was a stolen election.”\n\nNavarro also pointed to corporate media turning a blind eye to the Navarro Report and the substantial evidence of fraud in the 2020 presidential election that it details.\n\n“Just as the corporate media ignored purposefully the “In Trump Time” book, which arguably is the best history to date of the Trump White House, they have ignored any reference to the three-volume Navarro Report … The report’s been out there well prior to January 6, and nobody has ever discredited it.”\n\nDefending Against China\n\nThe former official described the Biden administration’s handling of its relationship with the Chinese regime as “total appeasement.”\n\n“I’m very, very concerned that the weakness that Biden showed Putin has resulted in the invasion of Ukraine. The weakness that Biden is showing Xi Jinping may result in an invasion of Taiwan,” he said.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nNavarro, who has authored books including “The Coming China Wars,” “Death By China,” and “Crouching Tiger: What China’s Militarism Means for the World,” is known for his strong defense of the United States against totalitarian China’s aggression, and was one of the chief architects of the Trump administration’s tough trade policies with respect to Beijing. Trump slapped nearly $360 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods during his presidency.\n\nIn the Trump White House, Navarro identified the Chinese Communist Party’s “seven deadly sins” of economic aggression, including cyber hacking to steal trade secrets, intellectual property theft, forced technology transfer, below-cost dumping of products into American markets, the use of heavily subsidized state-owned enterprises that employ predatory pricing, currency manipulation, and the flooding of American communities with fentanyl and other opioids.\n\nWhen asked about what the United States should do now to continue to defend against totalitarian China’s aggression, Navarro stated, “We were ready in a second [Trump administration] term to really up the tariffs.”\n\nHe continued, “I think something that would be a perfect complement to tariffs would be a complete cutting off of capital flows from America to China. It’s crazy that our pension funds, for example, are supporting companies in China that make weapons, for example. We tried to stop that.”\n\nIn November 2020, Trump issued an executive order prohibiting purchases by American investors of stocks in companies determined by the US Defense Department to be owned or controlled by the Chinese military. In June 2021, the Biden administration replaced this order with a revised version that in some ways expanded upon the original, including by widening the scope of Chinese companies that could be sanctioned.\n\nNavarro said that “China is an existential threat to the country,” and added, “My view is and has long been that we should stop doing any kind of business with them until they cease their economic aggressions. Geopolitical, revanchist, and imperialist aggression.”\n\nPointing to the need for America to show strength in the face of totalitarian China’s continuing and intensifying aggression, Navarro said, “Strength invites peace, weakness invites war.”', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2021/01/28/CPAC_2019_9A6A5372-1-1200x800.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:57'}

So far, Trump has only made one post on Truth Social since it was launched in February 2022.\n\nIn mid-April, Trump told Americano News that “Twitter’s become very boring” in recent months because “they’ve gotten rid of a lot of good voices on Twitter … a lot of their conservative voices.”\n\nThe deal was cemented roughly two weeks after the billionaire first revealed a 9 percent stake in the platform. Musk said last week that he had lined up $46.5 billion in financing to buy Twitter, putting pressure on the company’s board to negotiate a deal.\n\nTwitter said the transaction was unanimously approved by its board of directors and is expected to close in 2022, pending regulatory sign-off and the approval of shareholders.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2018/11/09/Tucker-Carlson-debate-1200x800.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:47'}

The constitutional protection of speech does not, on its own, engender a society in which the chance to be heard is truly abundant and free and equitably distributed.\n\n“Freedom for the wolves has often meant death to the sheep,” Mr. Berlin once said. This is a point often lost on Americans. Government — or large centralized authority — is one threat to liberty but not the only one. When it comes to speech, what has often kept a great many people from speaking isn’t censorship but the lack of a platform. Social media, including Twitter, came along and promised to change that. But when it became a cesspit of hate and harassment for women and people of color in particular, it began to offer a miserable bargain: You can be free to say what you wish, but your life can be made unrelentingly painful if you so dare.\n\nThe “censorship” that Mr. Musk performatively deplores consists of efforts to rectify these very real problems of harassment and abuse. Twitter has taken modest but wildly inadequate steps to improve safety on the platform. It has acknowledged it has a problem. It has recognized positive freedom of speech — the creation of a safe and non-life-ruining environment for the airing of thoughts. And it is this that Mr. Musk and his ilk seem to loathe.\n\nThis is why his deal to purchase Twitter is so dangerous. In recent years, there has been progress toward positive freedom of speech — real work to give everyone, truly everyone, more meaningful occasion to speak. Mr. Musk apparently wants to shut that down. Instead, in a moment of proto-fascism on the political right, his priority seems to be to undam the flood of bile and bigotry and bullying and disinformation.\n\nThe country already faces the very real prospect, starting at noon on Jan. 20, 2025, of a descent toward racist authoritarianism and a protracted slide away from liberal democracy. If your idea of what the country needs in this moment is less clamping down on hate and lies and more rightists gone wild, whew.\n\nThe plutocrats have already rigged the economy. That’s just the first step. Then you take some of the spoils and reinvest it in buying even more political influence, so that political inequality can help keep economic inequality yawning. You buy up media or social media platforms and thus can help rig the discourse in your favor, taking control of the tools used by regular people to fight back. You venture, as Mr. Musk did, to a TED conference and, without much pushback, brand yourself as a kind of public intellectual, a thought leader, a visionary, and thereby in many people’s minds you became a sage, not a robber baron.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be this way. We can have nice things. But we’re going to have to learn to see through the fraudulent stories that elevate figures like Mr. Musk into heroes. We’re going to have to legislate real guardrails — perhaps like those created by the European Union’s Digital Services Act — on social media platforms that are too big to entrust democracy to. We’re going to have to build nonprofit alternatives to the platforms and see if they can become meaningful venues.', 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/26/opinion/26giridharadas_2/26giridharadas_2-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:56'}

It can be bought or sold on crypto exchanges like Coinbase or on trading apps like Robinhood and Webull. One Dogecoin is worth 16 cents as of Tuesday morning. It's never been worth more than 64 cents. Creator Billy Markus said last year that he invented the coin as a joke.

He added: 'Do you want an edit button?'\n\nApril 5: He joins Twitter's board of directors - sees share price rocket\n\nTwitter said the tech tycoon was joining the company's board of directors, causing the social media platform's shares to rise over 7 per cent in premarket trading.\n\nIt led to speculation he would try to address what he called the platform's 'failure to adhere to free speech principles' and 'fundamentally undermine democracy'.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Musk would have served on the board until the company's 2024 annual shareholders meeting.\n\nAs long as he remains a director, the agreement said, he could not won more than 14.9 percent of the company's stock.\n\nIt meant he would not have been able to take over the company until well after his term on the board was over.\n\nThe firm said: 'Twitter is committed to impartiality in the development and enforcement of its policies and rules.\n\n'Our policy decisions are not determined by the Board or shareholders, and we have no plans to reverse any policy decisions.'\n\n'As always our Board plays an important advisory and feedback role across the entirety of our service.\n\n'Our day to day operations and decisions are made by Twitter management and employees.'\n\nApril 8: Asset managers take over Musk as largest shareholders\n\nAsset manager Vanguard Group increased its stake to overtake Musk as the largest shareholder.\n\nVanguard owned 10.3 percent of Twitter, while the Tesla tycoon owned 9.1 per cent, making him the largest individual shareholder.\n\nVanguard, led by CEO Tim Buckley, increased its stake in the company at some point during the first quarter, according to SEC filings made on April 8.\n\nIt previously reported owning 67.2million shares of Twitter or about 8.4 per cent of the company as of the end of December, according to FactSet.\n\nOther owners of large quantities of Twitter stock included Morgan Stanley, Fidelity and Black Rock.\n\nVanguard, led by CEO Tim Buckley, increased its stake in the company at some point during the first quarter, according to SEC filings made on April 8\n\nApril 9: Musk rejects the offer to join Twitter's board of directors\n\nMusk rejected an offer to join Twitter's board after disclosing his stake in the company.\n\nAnalysts said the move signaled his intention to take over the company as a board seat would have limited his stake to just under 15 per cent.\n\nParag Agrawal said the board would still 'remain open' to Musk's input, but warned: 'There will be distractions ahead but our goals and priorities remain unchanged.'\n\nHe said: 'The board and I had many discussions about Elon joining the board, and with Elon directly. We were excited to collaborate and clear about the risks.\n\n'We also believed that having Elon as a fiduciary of the company where he, like all board members, has to act in the best interests of the company and all our shareholders, was the best path forward. The board offered him a seat.'\n\nAgrawal continued: 'We announced on Tuesday that Elon would be appointed to the board contingent on a background check and formal acceptance.\n\n'Elon's appointment to the board was to become officially effective 4/9, but Elon shared that same morning that he will no longer be joining the board.'\n\nParag Agrawal said the board would still 'remain open' to Musk's input, but warned: 'There will be distractions ahead but our goals and priorities remain unchanged'\n\nApril 12: Twitter shareholder Marc Bain Rasella files suit against Musk\n\nMarc Bain Rasella filed a lawsuit against Musk for alleged securities fraud at a Manhattan federal court, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nThe suit claimed the billionaire was required to disclose his holdings to the SEC by March 24, but the delay kept Twitter's share price down allowing Musk to buy more.\n\nMusk was accused of violating a regulatory deadline to reveal he had accumulated a stake of at least five per cent.\n\nInstead, according to the complaint, Musk did not disclose his position in Twitter until he had almost doubled his stake to more than nine per cent.\n\nThat strategy, the lawsuit alleges, hurt less wealthy investors who sold shares in the company in the nearly two weeks before Musk acknowledged holding a major stake.\n\nApril 14: The Tesla tycoon offers to buy Twitter for $43 BILLION\n\nMusk offered to buy Twitter for $43billion, a regulatory filing showed, as he moved to seize the social media giant.\n\nMusk's offer price of $54.20 per share represented a 38 per cent premium to the closing price of Twitter's stock on April 1.\n\nThis was the last trading day before the Tesla CEO's over nine per cent investment in the company was publicly announced.\n\nIt even appeared to reference marijuana - also known as 420 - a common reference used by Musk on Twitter.\n\nTwitter said in a regulatory filing Musk provided a letter containing a proposal to buy the remaining shares of Twitter he did not already own.\n\nApril 15: Twitter launches 'poison pill' strategy to stop Musk buyout\n\nTwitter's board announced a dramatic poison pill plan to prevent Musk from increasing his stake in the company.\n\nAlso known as a shareholder rights provision, the plan would trigger a dilution of shares if any shareholder builds up a 15 per cent stake without the board's approval.\n\nThe plan did not prevent Twitter from accepting Musk's offer or entering negotiations with him or other potential buyers.\n\nBut it did stop the billionaire from putting pressure on the board by buying up ever more shares on the open market.\n\nMusk hit back with a laughing emoji to a version of the classic 'Distracted Boyfriend' meme mocking Twitter's board.\n\nThe imaged depicted 'Twitter's board' looking wistfully at the option to 'keep that easy gig that gives me shares' as 'Twitter investors' look on with disgust.\n\nTwitter's board is led by chairman Bret Taylor, who is also the co-CEO of business software giant Salesforce\n\nApril 16: Musk tweets Love Me Tender in tease of hostile takeover\n\nMusk tweeted 'Love Me Tender' as he again teased at the possibility of a hostile takeover of Twitter.\n\nThe billionaire posted the Elvis Presley lyrics in a potential bid to lure shareholders with a tender offer that could see him seize control.\n\nA tender offer would see him bypass the board and go to shareholders with his offer of $54.20 a share - but he would need to show how he would finance his bid.\n\nHe also appeared to suggest he would strip board members of their salaries, saying they would get '$0 if my bid succeeds'.\n\nApril 18: Jack Dorsey slams the Twitter board for 'plots and coups'\n\nJack Dorsey slammed the board of Twitter as he weighed into the toxic fight over Elon Musk's attempted hostile takeover for the first time.\n\nThe former CEO, who is still a member of the board himself, blasted the 'plots and coups' that were 'consistently the dysfunction of the company'.\n\nIn a series of bombshell tweets and replies, he endorsed one posting saying that 'a bad board will kill a company every time'.\n\nReplying to one post, he said: 'When I was fired in 2008 and made chair, the board took most of my shares away from me.\n\n'I also gave 1 per cent of the company back to the employee pool in 2015. So, ended up with very little of company.'\n\nHe also replied to one comment mentioning 'plots and coups' in the Twitter board saying: 'it's consistently been the dysfunction of the company'.\n\nEarlier in the thread, he replied to a post quoting a 'Silicon Valley proverb' by venture capitalist Fred Destin.\n\nIt said: 'Good boards don't create good companies, but a bad board will kill a company every time.'

And Musk also got $21billion through equity financing.\n\nBut he has used 'a portion' of his shares in Tesla as collateral in the high-stakes move, which analysts warned could have huge ramifications for the company.\n\nApril 22: Musk posts 'boner' killer picture of Bill Gates on Twitter\n\nMusk dissed Bill Gates' gut on Twitter, posting a photo of the Microsoft mogul next to Apple's controversial pregnant man emoji 'in case you need to lose a boner.'\n\nHe posted a follow-up image in response to the Friday post of six hooded figured captioned 'shadow ban council reviewing Tweet'.\n\nThe joke could further infuriate woke Twitter staffers angered by Musk's ongoing bid to buy the firm after saying he would support free speech.\n\nThat is because the pregnant man emoji is aimed at being inclusive to transgender people - with Musk frequently taking aim at what he sees as woke overreach.\n\nApril 25: Musk finalizes deal to buy Twitter\n\nMusk was closing in on seizing Twitter as talks between the Tesla magnate and the tech giant entered their final stages, reports say.\n\nThe tycoon's representatives were said to be hammering out terms including a timeline and fees if an agreement was signed and then fell apart.\n\nThe two sides were reportedly working into the early morning to finalize the 'fluid and fast-moving' negotiations.\n\nTwitter shares soared by four percent as the markets opened to $50.84 a share amid reports it would be seized by Musk.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Twitter announced it had 'entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by an entity wholly owned by Elon Musk, for $54.20 per share in cash in a transaction valued at approximately $44 billion. Upon completion of the transaction, Twitter will become a privately held company.'", 'image': 'https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/26/14/57069119-0-image-a-49_1650980561815.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:46'}

After months in short supply, federal officials say the medications are now more widely available, yet are being underused.\n\nAs part of the new effort, the federal government plans to allow thousands of more pharmacies to directly order highly effective COVID-19 treatments like Pfizer\'s Paxlovid antiviral pills, which can reduce the risk of becoming severely ill. They also plan to launch additional "test-to-treat" sites, where Americans can get diagnosed and receive the pills in a single visit.\n\nPaxlovid was first authorized by the Food and Drug Administration in December, and supplies were hard to come by at first. Now the pills are no longer scarce, but they still aren\'t getting to everyone who might benefit from treatment.\n\n"It\'s pretty clear from the uptake of Paxlovid, and the rate of hospitalizations and deaths over the months that Paxlovid has been available, that there are still some folks who could have benefited from these medications," an administration official told reporters on Monday in a briefing to preview the announcement.\n\nFederal officials have voiced concerns publicly for weeks that treatments like Paxlovid, Merck and Ridgeback\'s Lagevrio antiviral pills, and Eli Lilly\'s bebtelovimab monoclonal antibody drug were not reaching enough Americans.\n\nOfficials said Monday that reported use of the antiviral pills has more than doubled over the past month, from 22,000 courses a week to over 55,000. That comes as cases and hospitalizations have begun to climb nationwide, driven by the highly-contagious Omicron BA.2 subvariant.\n\nIn New England, federal data has tracked the pace of new COVID-19 hospitalizations surging among patients 70 and older — the age group most vulnerable to severe COVID-19 — since the beginning of April. The rate of new admissions is now higher than the peak reached over the Delta variant wave last year, but remains a fraction of the record highs during the winter Omicron wave.\n\n"We certainly know that there\'s more room to go. We can save more lives by giving this medication to more people," said the official.\n\nGetting Paxlovid antiviral pills\n\nPaxlovid treatment needs to begin within a few days of first developing symptoms.\n\nA course of treatment is made up of three tablets that are taken twice a day, in the morning and evening, over the course of five days, for a total of 30 pills. Initial clinical trials showed the drug reduced the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization or death by 88%, compared to placebo.\n\nPaxlovid cannot be taken at the same time as several medications that can reduce the drug\'s efficacy or lead to potentially fatal side effects.\n\nThrough outreach to doctors and patients, officials say they hope more eligible Americans will act quickly to get the now-plentiful antiviral pills sitting on pharmacy shelves.\n\nPfizer\'s COVID-19 drug Paxlovid Fabian Sommer/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\n"A lot of providers early on in that scarcity mindset, when there were fewer courses available across the country, were really reserving this for only the folks who they thought would be the sickest of the sick," an administration official told reporters.\n\nOn Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health alert urging doctors to step up prescribing of effective COVID-19 treatments — and imploring at-risk patients who test positive not to delay in contacting their doctors, "even if your symptoms are mild."\n\nA "tranche" of more than 100,000 courses of the antiviral pills will be made available to all of the federal government\'s pharmacy partners to order directly, instead of through federal and local allocations. Officials say they expect the move will raise the number of sites with drugs in stock from 20,000 to 30,000.\n\nThat comes on top of efforts like the administration\'s nationwide "test-to-treat initiative" launched at thousands of pharmacies earlier this year.\n\nFollowing concerns that the program was inaccessible to Americans living in many parts of the country, officials said the administration is planning to launch new "federally-supported Test-to-Treat sites" beyond the 2,200 locations currently in the program.\n\n"I think we\'re going to be working really closely with these new federally supported sites, work directly with state, territorial, and jurisdictional leadership to identify the places that need more support," said an administration official.\n\nChallenges and questions\n\nOfficials acknowledged that the new moves do not address some of the criticisms levied against the Biden administration\'s treatment effort.\n\nDespite objections from pharmacy trade groups, the FDA excludes most pharmacists from being able to prescribe Paxlovid or Lagevrio. For at-risk Americans without access to a "test-to-treat" drugstore that has a qualifying provider available, this means some will have to make multiple trips to get the pills.\n\n"You have to develop COVID symptoms, you have to subsequently get a test for COVID-19, get the result of that test, find and go to see a provider, get a prescription, and then fill that prescription. That\'s six steps in five days," said an official.\n\nIt also does not include an expansion to who is eligible to take the drugs under the FDA\'s emergency use authorization.\n\nSpeaking at Uniformed Services University earlier this month, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the president\'s chief medical adviser, hinted that Paxlovid might soon be expanded to lower-risk patients "in order to prevent them possibly from getting long COVID."\n\nBoth Pfizer and Merck have also been running a range of trials that might support expanding use of the antiviral pills to more people. Results could come soon from a trial assessing Paxlovid in people who are exposed to the disease, but have not yet developed symptoms, which was due to be completed earlier this month.\n\nAnd administration officials at the briefing did not bring up growing reports of "rebound" or "relapse" symptoms — people who appear to recover from COVID-19 after taking the antiviral pills, but later get a new round of symptoms — which might lead to SARS-CoV-2 evolving resistance to the treatments.\n\nA spokesperson for Pfizer said the company was continuing to monitor data from their clinical trials of Paxlovid as well as real-world evidence, and has "not seen any resistance" to the drug.\n\nIn a statement, an FDA spokesperson acknowledged that reports of rebound "are important to evaluate further," but reiterated that the drug appeared 88% effective at reducing the risk of hospitalization or death in its clinical trial.\n\n"The FDA is evaluating the reports of viral load rebound after completing Paxlovid treatment and will share recommendations if appropriate," said the FDA\'s Chanapa Tantibanchachai.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/04/26/75834f94-0c35-4873-8166-5e4b24cfa0d3/thumbnail/1200x630/5625e6265f72e4689718b2845b0511c4/gettyimages-1238865166.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:22'}

Supply of the regimen was initially very limited, but as Covid-19 cases across the country have fallen and manufacturing has increased, it is now far more abundant. The White House is now moving to raise awareness of the pill and its availability, as well as making it easier to access.\n\nThe White House said Tuesday it is increasingly reaching out to doctors and announced that the drug will now be shipped directly to pharmacies, in addition to existing distribution channels run by states. That is expected to increase the number of sites from 20,000 to more than 30,000 next week and eventually to 40,000 locations.\n\nHowever, according to a senior Biden administration official speaking anonymously to Axios, many states are ordering just two-thirds of what is available to them and are using half their orders.\n\nProviders are probably limiting access to the pill because “we’ve had the experience in this pandemic before of operating in a scarcity mindset,” another administration official said in a press conference.\n\nMany states have opted for a lottery system to allocate Paxlovid and other Covid-19 drugs, often choosing to distribute the drugs to retail pharmacies instead of hospitals and clinics.\n\nAccording to Dr Douglas White, a University of Pittsburgh critical care doctor who helped design Pennsylvania’s lottery system for Covid-19 drug allocation, the system ends up favoring people who are not only aware of the drugs but have access to doctors to prescribe it and the ability to locate pharmacies that have them in stock.\n\n“The wealthy and well-connected will win the race,” White told the Los Angeles Times. It’s “the poster child for an unfair system.”\n\nDespite the administration’s attempt to reassure providers that there are enough pills for patients, in an interview with NPR on Monday, the White House’s Covid-19 response coordinator, Dr Ashish Jha, said that there are only enough pills “for the short run.” As of Tuesday, the US had ordered enough supply of the pills for 20 million people, which is estimated to last for several more months.\n\n“Right now, we’ve done a really good job of acquiring pills,” Jha said, adding that the Biden administration will need additional funding from Congress to acquire more pills. “We have to make sure that this is more than a short-term solution.”\n\nJha warned that the US will be running out of money for Paxlovid “reasonably soon,” and that “we actually aren’t even going to be able to pay our bills for what we’ve already entered into a contract with Pfizer for, so that’s going to be a problem.”\n\nThe Biden administration is expected to renew its request to Congress for $22bn in Covid-19 funding.\n\nPaxlovid, when administered within five days of symptoms appearing, has been proven to bring about a 90% reduction in hospitalizations and deaths among patients most likely to get severe disease. About 350 Americans are now dying each day from Covid-19, down from more than 2,600 during the height of the Omicron wave earlier this year.\n\nThe FDA authorized Pfizer’s drug for emergency use in adults and children age 12 or older with a positive Covid-19 test and early symptoms who face the highest risk of severe outcomes. That includes older people and those with conditions like obesity and heart disease, though the drug is not recommended for patients with severe kidney or liver problems.\n\nThe administration is also working to expand the number of “test-to-treat” sites that provide a one-stop shop for those with Covid-19 to get tested for the virus, consult with a medical professional if they’re positive and fill a prescription for Paxlovid on site.\n\nThere are now 2,200 such locations nationwide, though the administration hopes more sites come online in the next several weeks with support from the Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and pharmacy companies.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ec9f8e72eff2d14c7cbb28bd8af41604fea72e5/0_301_5075_3047/master/5075.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=269eeb032fb24072e4c2185b17d3cc66', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:54'}

That will soon include a series of new obligations for social media and other online platforms, called the Digital Services Act, after lawmakers agreed to the main points of the legislation last week.\n\n“Now we have very clear rules,” Mr. Breton said. “They can do whatever they want outside of Europe…but in Europe they will just have to fulfill [our] rules and obligations.”\n\nThe Digital Services Act aims to force platforms to take more responsibility for the content their users post online.

In the wake of this "great deplatforming," Republicans\' longstanding gripes with these platforms became a legislative priority.\n\nOne of the most aggressive of these Republican-led efforts to regulate social media is Texas\' H.B. 20. Ostensibly passed to combat the "dangerous movement by social media companies to silence conservative viewpoints and ideas," this bill prohibits social media platforms from removing users or content "based on the viewpoint" of the user or content. In its effort to protect conservative speech, Texas Republicans have adopted a historically discredited left-wing legal theory, dispensing with core conservative values in the process.\n\nIn the 1960s, a group of progressive scholars argued that the First Amendment does not merely prohibit the government from censoring private speech and press. In fact, they argued, it granted the government the affirmative power to control the mass media. In a capitalist system, they reasoned, the government must ensure that private media owners do not exclude unwelcome viewpoints, in order to protect the "democratic interest" in free speech. To this end, the scholars championed the Fairness Doctrine, right-of-reply mandates, and expansive applications of "common carriage" doctrine, which enable the government to force the inclusion of certain content.\n\nBorrowing from the same playbook, Texas now argues that First Amendment values require, rather than prohibit, government interference with private speech. H.B. 20 declares that social media platforms are common carriers like telephone companies and thus are subject to onerous restrictions over who and what they may host. According to Texas, H.B. 20 serves the democratic interest in protecting the free exchange of ideas and information. But like the collectivist efforts that preceded it, Texas\' misguided attempt to advance "First Amendment rights in the Lone Star State" violates private platforms\' First Amendment rights to choose what speech they publish.\n\nAs we explained in a recently filed amicus curiae brief on behalf of the Cato Institute, courts have repeatedly rejected such regulations, and for good reasons.\n\nFirst, as a federal district court correctly noted last year, the First Amendment protects social media platforms\' discretion to publish or remove content. The Supreme Court established this right in the 1974 case Miami Herald Publishing Company v. Tornillo, when it struck down a Florida law that forced newspapers to print responses to their criticism of political candidates. The Court explained that this "right-of-reply" law infringed on newspapers\' right to choose what content they publish.\n\nThe Supreme Court affirmed that First Amendment rights apply with full force to internet media in 1997\'s Reno v. ACLU. Other federal courts have since upheld the editorial rights of search engines and social media sites. These precedents doom the Texas law. The state can\'t eviscerate platforms\' well-established First Amendment rights by arbitrarily calling them common carriers.\n\nSecond, efforts like H.B. 20 chill, rather than encourage, the exercise of free speech. Both the Florida right-of-reply law and the Fairness Doctrine actually discouraged the media from covering controversial topics that would trigger the forced-hosting requirements. Likewise, H.B. 20 will encourage platforms to ban entire subjects (say, discussions of terrorism) to avoid facing the unappetizing choice to either host objectionable viewpoints (such as pro-terrorism material) or face liability for removing each piece of content.\n\nThird, H.B. 20 violates fundamental property rights by forcing private platforms to host users and content they would otherwise exclude. The First Amendment does not authorize the government to co-opt private property to amplify certain viewpoints.\n\nThe supporters of the Texas law, like other conservative opponents of Big Tech, cite anecdotal accounts of inconsistent content moderation to support their claim of unfair bias. But it\'s more likely that these incidents are just casualties of the margin of error inherent in content moderation at scale. "Incorrect" removals of content happen millions of times per day to users representing every conceivable ideology. Conservatives are removed from platforms when they violate platforms\' terms of service, but Texas\' premise that conservatives are being unfairly targeted is unsubstantiated.\n\nBut even if it was substantiated, forced-hosting laws like H.B. 20 would contravene limited government, constitutional fidelity, and strong property rights, all of which are supposed to be core conservative values. If Texas Republicans really want to protect "conservative viewpoints," they should reacquaint themselves with those principles and reject giving the government more control over social media.', 'image': 'https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2022/04/timothy-hales-bennett-OwvRB-M3GwE-unsplash-scaled.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:31'}

Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), the chairwoman of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, said allowing Trump back on Twitter would be a major problem.\n\n“I think that’s very problematic,” she said of Trump’s possible return. “I don’t think that somebody who encouraged and organized a violent insurrection to take over our government should be allowed on Twitter.”\n\nAsked about the loosening of content standards, she said she “would certainly have concerns” but added she hadn’t looked at the deal closely enough to “get into a big analysis.”\n\nTrump, who has launched a social media venture that includes a platform intended to vie with Twitter, told Fox News on Monday that he doesn’t plan to return to Twitter.\n\n“I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,” he said, referring to his Truth Social messaging platform, before the deal was announced. “I hope Elon buys Twitter because he’ll make improvements to it and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth. The bottom line is, no, I am not going back to Twitter.”\n\nTwitter permanently suspended Trump because of what it called “the risk of further incitement of violence” after a mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to halt the certification of President Biden’s victory.\n\nTwitter later unveiled a civic integrity policy that prohibited the use of its services for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes. It also reserved the right to flag or reduce the visibility of tweets containing false or misleading information about civic processes.\n\nAt a TED conference this month, Musk stressed the importance of allowing free speech on Twitter.\n\n“Twitter has become kind of the de facto town square, so it’s just really important that people have both the reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely within the bounds of the law,” he said.\n\nConservatives on Monday applauded Musk’s move.\n\n“Elon Musk did his part for free speech today. Let’s hope the Supreme Court does as well,” former Rep. Mark Walker (N.C.), a conservative Republican running for Senate, tweeted Monday afternoon.\n\nDemocrats are worried what that means for policing claims that Biden stole the 2020 presidential election or misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n“I’m a big free speech guy, but this stuff isn’t working. It’s terrorizing democracy, and from that perspective I think it’s bad for Democrats in this sense: These Republican alt groups tend to dominate. They tend to have much more of a footprint on these social media platforms than Democrats do,” said Steve Jarding, a Democratic strategist and former senior adviser to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\nJarding is also the communications director for a new social media platform called Pixstory, which has a business model designed to root out hate and misinformation by giving integrity scores to people who post on the site.\n\nBut Jarding called it “a horrible problem” that the world’s richest person is taking over a major means of political discourse at a time when Democrats are discussing proposals to tax the unrealized capital gains of multibillionaires such as Musk to pay for proposals to fight climate change and economic inequality.\n\n“He could turn it into anything that he wants. He controls literally hundreds of millions of hits, if you will, or clicks on a platform that he can determine whether it’s used in a good way or a bad way, and that’s too much concentration with one individual,” Jarding added.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/stabenowdebbie_020922arl.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:10'}

As YouTube celebrates its 17th birthday, the game-changing user-generated video platform once known for funny pet videos and other benign content continues to attract criticism for its alleged role in fostering extremism. Ample evidence casts doubt on the idea that social media platforms are radicalizing American youth, but high-profile anecdotes about bad turns allegedly inspired by YouTube, Facebook, and other sites make it hard to combat such claims. Now one such story may come before the Supreme Court—and threaten a foundational internet speech law.\n\nThe case (Gonzalez v. Google LLC) involves a man whose daughter was killed in a 2015 ISIS attack in Paris. The grieving father, Reynaldo Gonzalez, sued YouTube\'s parent company, Google, under the U.S. Anti-Terrorism Act. Gonzalez claims that ISIS posted recruitment videos on YouTube, that YouTube recommended these videos to users, and that this led to his daughter\'s death.\n\nGonzalez\'s circumstances are tragic, but his claim is convoluted and patently illogical. To buy it, you have to buy the idea that without YouTube, the terrorist group not only would be unable to recruit members but would cease to use existing networks to carry out attacks.\n\nThe Supreme Court has not yet decided whether it will hear Gonzalez\'s case. But if it does, it could give the Court a chance to consider the parameters of Section 230, the federal law preventing internet companies and users from being liable for all third-party speech (and pretty much the backbone of the internet as we know it).\n\nSCOTUSblog notes that in 2020, Justice Clarence Thomas suggested that "in an appropriate case, we should consider whether the text of this increasingly important statute aligns with the current state of immunity enjoyed by Internet platforms." (Thomas made a similar suggestion earlier this year.)\n\n"The petition in Gonzalez v. Google LLC tries to present itself as the case Thomas has been looking for," writes Andrew Hamm:\n\nThe district court dismissed Gonzalez\'s claim on the ground that Section 230 nonetheless protected Google for its recommendations because ISIS produced the videos, not Google. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit affirmed, concluding that Section 230 protects such recommendations, at least if the provider\'s algorithm treated content on its website similarly. However, the panel in Gonzalez considered itself bound to reach this result because of a recent case on the same issue that another 9th Circuit panel decided while Gonzalez was pending. The Gonzalez panel further concluded that, if it could resolve the question itself, Section 230 would not protect a provider\'s content recommendations. Gonzalez admits that the circuits to face this question are not split. Instead, Gonzalez suggests that, had his case simply come out before the other 9th Circuit decision, then Google would be the one seeking review. Regardless, he maintains, the providers\' financial dependence on advertisements and hence on algorithms that can target users makes this question of recommendations important to resolve.\n\nGonzalez is far from the first person to sue social media companies over terrorist acts. But these people "have yet to talk a court into agreeing with their arguments," as Tim Cushing noted at Techdirt last fall.\n\n"The facts in these cases are invariably awful: often people have been brutally killed and their loved ones are seeking redress for their loss. There is a natural, and perfectly reasonable, temptation to give them some sort of remedy from someone, but as we argued in our brief, that someone cannot be an internet platform," wrote constitutional lawyer Cathy Gellis in 2017:\n\nThere are several reasons for this, including some that have nothing to do with Section 230. For instance, even if Section 230 did not exist and platforms could be liable for the harms resulting from their users\' use of their services, for them to be liable there would have to be a clear connection between the use of the platform and the harm.\n\nSection 230 "should prevent a court from ever even reaching the tort law analysis," added Gellis. "With Section 230, a platform should never find itself having to defend against liability for harm that may have resulted from how people used it."\n\nA new study backs up what advocates for Section 230 have been saying for a long time: The law protects small companies and creators more than big tech giants.\n\n"If you understand the mechanisms by which Section 230 actually works, the key is that it gets frivolous and wasteful lawsuits kicked out of court much earlier—when the costs are still intense, but more bearable," points out Mike Masnick in a Techdirt post about the study. "Without Section 230, the end result of the court case may be the same—where the company wins—but the costs would be much, much higher. For Facebook and Google that\'s not going to make a huge difference. But for smaller companies, it can be the difference between life and death."\n\n"Larger enterprises are less impacted by lawsuits," point out the authors of the study, in a report titled "Understanding Section 230 & the Impact of Litigation on Small Providers." A large company "may already have: 1) lawyers ready to deal with lawsuits (allowing the business to continue with minimal disruption); 2) insurance coverage that can offset the cost of a defense, a settlement, or a damage award; and 3) sufficient revenue and cash reserves such that most cases are viewed as a cost of doing business rather than a cataclysmic event."\n\nSmall companies are less likely to have or be able to afford any of these things, making it less likely that they will fight even lawsuits that they would win.\n\nPoliticians, alas, have taken to scapegoating Section 230 for basically anything they or their constituents don\'t like about the internet. And lawyers keep getting creative in their anti–Section 230 arguments, suggesting that while Section 230 may broadly protect internet platforms from liability for many things that users post, the law does not covers various facets of these platforms—their design, their algorithms, etc..\n\nOccasionally, judges appear sympathetic to this. In Taamneh v. Twitter, which the 9th Circuit ruled on last year, Judge Marsha Berzon wrote that Section 230 protects "only traditional activities of publication and distribution—such as deciding whether to publish, withdraw, or alter content—and does not include activities that promote or recommend content or connect content users to each other. I urge this Court to reconsider our precedent en banc to the extent that it holds that section 230 extends to the use of machine-learning algorithms to recommend content and connections to users."\n\n"This is a really weird, really dangerous place to start drawing the line in Section 230 lawsuits," wrote Tim Cushing last summer. "Algorithms react to input from users. If YouTube can\'t be held directly responsible for videos uploaded by users, it makes sense it would be immunized against algorithmically suggesting content based on users\' actions and preferences. The algorithm does next to nothing on its own without input from content viewers. It takes a user to really get it moving."\n\nFREE MINDS\n\nA federal appeals court has rejected a university\'s ban on "discriminatory harassment." The University of Central Florida\'s "discriminatory harassment" ban likely violates the First Amendment, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals said. The case is Speech First, Inc. v. Cartwright, and you can read the whole ruling here. In essence, the court found the school\'s policy against allegedly discriminatory speech to be too broad:\n\n[T]he policy (1) prohibits a wide range of "verbal, physical, electronic, and other" expression concerning any of (depending on how you count) some 25 or so characteristics; (2) states that prohibited speech "may take many forms, including verbal acts, name-calling, graphic or written statements" and even "other conduct that may be humiliating"; (3) employs a gestaltish "totality of known circumstances" approach to determine whether particular speech, for instance, "unreasonably alters" another student\'s educational experience; and (4) reaches not only a student\'s own speech, but also her conduct "encouraging," "condoning," or "failing to intervene" to stop another student\'s speech. The policy, in short, is staggeringly broad, and any number of statements—some of which are undoubtedly protected by the First Amendment—could qualify for prohibition under its sweeping standards. To take a few obvious examples, the policy targets "verbal, physical, electronic or other conduct" based on "race," "ethnicity," "religion [or] non-religion," "sex," and "political affiliation." Among the views that Speech First\'s members have said they want to advocate are that "abortion is immoral," that the government "should not be able to force religious organizations to recognize marriages with which they disagree," that "affirmative action is deeply unfair," that "a man cannot become a woman because he \'feels\' like one," that "illegal immigration is dangerous," and that "the Palestinian movement is anti-Semitic."\n\nIn a concurring opinion, Judge Stanley Marcus warned against "the grave peril posed by a policy that effectively polices adherence to intellectual dogma."\n\n"History provides us with ample warning of those times and places when colleges and universities have stopped pursuing truth and have instead turned themselves into cathedrals for the worship of certain dogma," wrote Marcus. "By depriving itself of academic institutions that pursue truth over any other concern, a society risks falling into the abyss of ignorance. Humans are not smart enough to have ideas that lie beyond challenge and debate."\n\nThe Volokh Conspiracy has more on the ruling (which includes the lovely line "the state is a really big boy") here.\n\nFREE MARKETS\n\nPrivate space mission on its way back to earth. The first privately-funded trip to the International Space Station started its return trip yesterday. More from CNN:\n\nThe mission, called AX-1, was brokered by the Houston, Texas-based startup Axiom Space, which books rocket rides, provides all the necessary training, and coordinates flights to the ISS for anyone who can afford it. The four crew members—Michael López-Alegría, a former NASA astronaut-turned-Axiom employee who is commanding the mission; Israeli businessman Eytan Stibbe; Canadian investor Mark Pathy; and Ohio-based real estate magnate Larry Connor—left the space station aboard their SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule on Sunday at 9:10 pm EST….They will spend about one day free flying through orbit before plummeting back into the atmosphere and parachuting to a splashdown landing off the coast of Florida around 1 pm ET Monday. AX-1, which launched on April 8, was originally billed as a 10-day mission, but delays extended the mission by about a week.\n\nThis isn\'t the first time private citizens have been able to pay for seats on spacecraft. "But AX-1 is the first mission with a crew entirely comprised of private citizens with no active members of a government astronaut corps accompanying them in the capsule during the trip to and from the ISS," reports CNN. "It\'s also the first time private citizens have traveled to the ISS on a US-made spacecraft."\n\nAnd it\'s also a powerful reminder that perhaps the next era of space exploration needn\'t be government funded and managed.\n\nQUICK HITS\n\n• Air Force Major General William T.

Musk haters have taken to the site to declare that Donald Trump will now probably win the 2024 election, that Musk\'s bid is really about white power, that Section 230 must be reformed, and that, yes, Musk\'s new policies will be lethal. (Perhaps the death toll will be even larger than net neutrality\'s!)\n\nSo, for users of the platform, what\'s likely to change?\n\nMusk has panned the site\'s existing content moderation policies, saying they are too restrictive and encroach on people\'s ability to speak freely without being censored. Some liberalization of these policies and the re-platforming of controversial figures like former President Donald Trump—who was banned in the wake of the January 6 riot for inciting violence among his fans—seems likely, though unpopular with droves of users.\n\nAt the mid-April TED conference in Vancouver, Musk talked about his interest in making Twitter\'s algorithm open-source. The Diff\'s Byrne Hobart took this a step further, outlining how "Twitter should monetize a protocol rather than run an app," and explaining the tension between Twitter as a consumer product and as "a way for individual users to update a universal shared database, which can then be filtered based on who\'s interested in what." Hobart claims that it\'s possible that Twitter has been "radically miss-monetized," and that Musk could potentially realign its priorities. However, little of the online discourse has focused on the technical possibilities.\n\nThe new Twitter owner has, through coy tweets, hinted that his new policies will not be applied arbitrarily and that consistent application will mean some number of right-wing users currently cheering his new ownership will surely be disappointed:\n\nI hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 25, 2022\n\nA social media platform\'s policies are good if the most extreme 10% on left and right are equally unhappy — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 19, 2022\n\nElsewhere, Musk has said that Twitter is a "town square" or "public square," and that banning people from using the platform effectively prevents them from participating in the important discussions of the day.\n\nThough people who care about fostering a culture of free speech may agree with the tenor of Musk\'s comments, the analogy is a terrible one. For most of America, the public square is the school board meeting and the town council meeting. There are also numerous other privates spaces for civic engagement: the church pulpit and the post-sermon fray it inspires; neighborhood listservs and the cesspool that is NextDoor; or maybe it\'s Facebook, in-person conversations, and email lists. For many millions of Americans, Twitter is not integral to hashing out values, concerns, and disagreements. Think of the implications if we expected the government to treat such companies—which have their own terms of service and standards that they are free to decide and we are free to consent to—as something akin to public utilities.\n\nIf anything, the new owner of a social media company should convey an inflated sense of the platform\'s worth! But Musk has at times, despite his forceful defense of free speech culture on the internet, repeated confused talking points that indicate scattered thinking while simultaneously failing to fully flesh out what day-to-day operations will look like. For example, a lot of content moderation involves the unsexy—and not very ideological—challenge of keeping spam under control. And, as Mike Masnick points out at Techdirt, Musk doesn\'t seem to have a particularly robust understanding of "hate speech" and how much of what we call hate speech is, in fact, protected by the First Amendment.\n\nA lot remains to be seen about how Twitter will change and what Musk will bring to the table. Optimism, with some reservations about Musk\'s ability to execute, seems warranted. Hysteria—like declaring that it\'s now open season for white supremacists, that Musk\'s vision for free speech will be "lethal," or that Musk is an echo of imperialist, colonizer forebears because he wants to go to Mars—is not.', 'image': 'https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2022/04/thumbnail-9-3.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:46'}

Musk paid $44 billion to acquire the social media platform with the stated aim of turning it into a haven for "free speech."\n\nThe web is awash in speculation over what that means. Conservatives and people booted off the platform have pushed for Musk to reinstate banned accounts, including that of former President Donald Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, prominent Twitter figures are now saying they\'ll leave the platform in protest of its new owner. Among them is English actress Jameela Jamil, who tweeted her fears Monday that Musk "is going to help this hell platform reach its final form of totally lawless hate, bigotry, and misogyny."\n\nIt\'s unclear whether Musk will be able to realize all his plans for Twitter. The tech leader has floated less moderation, less advertising and an open-source algorithm. But Musk\'s stated ideals contradict his own actions.\n\nWhat Musk says he wants\n\nMusk has made clear he wants less moderation — which he considers censorship — on the platform.\n\n"Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated," he said in Monday\'s announcement about the acquisition.\n\nHe also said he wants to defeat the "spambots," or automated accounts that mimic real users; open the algorithm to public inspection and "authenticate all humans" using the platform.\n\nMusk laid out a definition of speech in a TED interview last week.\n\n"A good sign as to whether there is free speech is, is someone you don\'t like allowed to say something you don\'t like? If that is the case, we have free speech," he said.\n\nMusk said Twitter would abide by national laws that restrict speech around the world. Beyond that, he said, he\'d be "very reluctant" to delete posts or permanently ban users who violate the company\'s rules.\n\nHe had previously criticized Trump\'s ban from social media in the wake of the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Twitter and Facebook permanently banned Trump\'s account on the grounds that he incited violence.\n\n"A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech," Musk tweeted days after Trump was banned from both Facebook and Twitter.\n\nHow Musk responds to disagreement\n\nMusk\'s own history, however, puts in doubt his commitment to let people he doesn\'t like speak. As the newsletter Popular Information has documented, Musk has regularly blocked users who criticize him or Tesla; threatened pro-union Tesla employees and company whistleblowers; and has aggressively gone after short-sellers and journalists who are critical of Tesla, sometimes calling their work "false" or "misleading."\n\nIn 2018, he launched a vendetta against Linette Lopez, an Insider journalist critical of Tesla, a move which writer Felix Salmon called "obsessive and deranged."\n\nMusk\'s popular tweets typically send a swarm of his social media fans directly to the accounts of reporters to harass them for hours or days.\n\nSome academics say that Musk\'s hands-off approach threatens to bring Twitter to its bad old days, when harassment and abuse were rampant.\n\n"With Musk, his posturing of free speech — just leave everything up — that would be bad in and of itself," said Paul Barrett, the deputy director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University. "If you stop moderating — with automated systems and human reviews — a site like Twitter, in the space of a short period of time, you would have a cesspool."\n\nSome former Twitter employees are also dismayed by Musk\'s successful bid for the company.\n\n"Twitter is going to let a man-child essentially take over their platform," said Leslie Miley, a former Twitter employee who has also worked for Google and Apple. Miley, who was the only Black engineer at Twitter in a leadership position when he left the company in 2015, echoed doubts shared by others about Musk\'s grasp of the platform\'s complexities.\n\n"I am not sure if Elon knows what he is getting," Miley said. "He may just find that having Twitter is a lot different than wanting Twitter."\n\nUnfettered expression does not attract advertisers\n\nA decade ago, a Twitter executive called the company "the free speech wing of the free speech party," underscoring its commitment to untrammeled freedom of expression. But the company reversed itself after reports of online abuse and harassment became frequent.\n\nIn the U.S., a visceral 2014 article by journalist Amanda Hess exposed the incessant, vile harassment many women faced just for posting on Twitter or other online forums. Twitter also learned about the consequences of an unmoderated social platform: mainly, that it undercut their funding from advertisers.\n\nAds are how Twitter makes money, and companies generally don\'t want their ads running against violent threats, hate speech that bleeds into incitement or incendiary information aimed at tipping elections or undermining public health.\n\nGoogle, Barrett pointed out, quickly learned this lesson the hard way when major companies like Toyota and Anheuser-Busch yanked their ads after they ran ahead of YouTube videos produced by extremists in 2015.\n\nOnce it was clear just how unhealthy the conversation had gotten, Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey spent years trying to improve what he called the "health" of the conversation on the platform.\n\nThe company was an early adopter of the "report abuse" button after U.K. member of parliament Stella Creasy received a barrage of rape and death threats on the platform. The online abuse was the result of a seemingly positive tweet in support of feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez, who successfully advocated for novelist Jane Austen to appear on a British banknote. Creasy\'s online harasser was sent to prison for 18 weeks.\n\nTwitter has continued to craft rules and invest in staff and technology that detected violent threats, harassment and misinformation that violated its policies. After evidence emerged that Russia used Twitter\'s platforms to try to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election, social media companies stepped up their efforts against political misinformation. All have struggled with defining "misinformation," however, and been accused of both leaving up false content as well as over-censoring legitimate posts.\n\nHard to unwind moderation\n\nThe big question now is how far Musk wants to ratchet back these systems — and whether users and advertisers will stick around if he does.\n\nLike Miley, the former Twitter engineer, experts who have studied content moderation and researched Twitter express doubt that Musk knows what he is getting into. After all, there are plenty of fledgling examples of so-called free speech-focused platforms that have been launched in the past few years as Twitter alternatives, largely by conservatives unhappy with the Twitter\'s crackdown on hate, harassment and misinformation. Many such sites have struggled to deal with toxic content, and at least one has been cut off by its own technology providers in protest.\n\n"This move just shows how effective (moderation features) have been to annoy those in power," said Kirsten Martin, a professor of technology ethics at the University of Notre Dame. "I would be worried as to how this would change Twitter\'s values."\n\nThe fact that no other bidders emerged in public before Musk\'s deal was a sign that other would-be acquirers might find Twitter too difficult to improve, said Third Bridge analyst Scott Kessler.\n\n"This platform is pretty much the same one we\'ve had over the last decade or so," Kessler said. "You\'ve had a lot of smart people trying to figure out what they should do, and they\'ve had trouble. It\'s probably going to be tough to make a lot of headway."\n\nEven now, Americans say they\'re more likely to be harassed on social media than any other online forum, with women, people of color and LGBTQ users reporting a disproportionate amount of that abuse. Roughly 80% of users believe the companies are still doing only a "fair or poor" job of handling that harassment, according to a Pew Research Center survey of U.S. adults last year.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/04/30/39aaad79-fd57-40fa-b203-bc4143cf40f2/thumbnail/1200x630g8/aef00fb0dcf931880dd52af0a50dc345/gettyimages-1206290121.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:24'}

How can the American people be confident that his administration is conducting a serious investigation?” Hagerty asked.\n\n“Because we put the investigation in the hands of a Trump appointee, from the previous administration, who’s the United States attorney for the District of Delaware, and because you have me as the attorney general, who is committed to the independence of the Justice Department from any influence from the White House in criminal matters,” Garland, a Biden appointee, responded.\n\nThe probe was first revealed by Hunter Biden in late 2020. He claimed that prosecutors were investigating his “tax affairs.”\n\nDavid Weiss, the U.S. attorney for Delaware, later confirmed the investigation but has declined to share any details.\n\nA grand jury subpoena showed that prosecutors compelled banks to share financial records of Hunter Biden and the president’s brother, James Biden. Additionally, the mother of one of Hunter Biden’s children has said she testified to authorities pursuant to a subpoena.\n\nHagerty pressed Garland on whether a special counsel is appropriate, considering the public comments by Klain and White House communications director Kate Bedingfield.\n\n“There’s an obvious conflict of interest here. Because those who are investigating the Biden family and their enterprise can be fired by the head of the family who is being investigated,” Hagerty said.\n\nGarland declined to say whether the department has or is considering appointing a special counsel, though he noted that special counsels are also employees of the Department of Justice.\n\nHe also would not answer when asked if he agreed with the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller, who was tasked with investigating allegations of collusion between Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia.\n\n“The question of whether to have a special counsel is one that is internal decision-making in the department, so I don’t want to make any judgments one way or the other,” Garland told Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) later in the hearing. “I’m quite comfortable with the United States attorney for that district continuing in the role that he’s playing.”', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/26/garland-before-senate-1200x800.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:30'}

In Canada, vaccine-free Canadians still cannot board a train or a plane and travel from one region of the country to another.\n\nIn Canada, air and train travel are regulated by the federal government, even when you travel within the same province. The feds have made it so only a vaccine passport, or very limited jab exemptions, will afford you the opportunity to visit family, friends, or travel for work.\n\nThis means that if you lived in, let’s say, Kitchener, Ontario, you could not get on a VIA Rail train and travel to Toronto… even though you could travel from Kitchener to Toronto on a commuter train that is not under federal jurisdiction.\n\nIsn’t “science” wonderful!\n\nOh, and vaccine-free Canadians also can’t LEAVE the country. Unjabbed Canadians are told they can’t “put others at risk” by boarding a plane with vaccinated people (because vaccines suddenly…work?). Apparently, it is good for the unvaccinated to stay in Canada, even though … they are risk to everyone else who is protected by a vaccine?\n\nTrudeau’s insecurity on display\n\nNow, on the one hand it is quite easy to understand why Trudeau is acting like an evil dictator: he has proven himself to be an immoral tyrant on many occasions. However, given the fact that other leftist tyrants have eased up, it is clearly not just leftism or progressivism that causing him to trap Canadians indefinitely in their home like real-life versions of The Truman Show. (How fitting that it was Canadian Jim Carrey who starred in that film.)\n\nThere is something unique about Trudeau that is causing him to become “regressive” as the rest of the leftist dominated West is affording vaccine-free citizens their civil rights.\n\nTo the outside world, Trudeau may look like a confident – if not cringeworthy – tin-pot dictator, but in reality, he is a 50-year-old boy with little to no virtue. He is essentially a spoiled teenager who can remember lines and present himself well in a tailored suit and has a family name that tricked people into thinking he was competent.\n\nHis (Canadian) father, Pierre Trudeau, for all his faults, was shrewd and intelligent – even if evil. Justin Trudeau is evil and unintelligent and quite obtuse.\n\nI can’t help but think he believes he must prove himself as being his own verified dictator in order to fill his daddy’s shoes. Simply put, he is insecure and projecting.\n\n— Article continues below Petition — PETITION: Ask Elon Musk to REINSTATE LifeSite\'s Twitter accounts Show Petition Text 7936 have signed the petition.

Sign this Petition Please SIGN and SHARE this petition to the new owner of Twitter, Elon Musk, asking him to reinstate LifeSiteNews\' truth-telling Twitter accounts which have been suspended since early 2021. After contentious negotiations, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has purchased Twitter, thereby transforming the tech giant into a private company. A self-styled "free speech absolutist," Mr. Musk\'s entrepreneurial spirit may define his approach to governing Twitter, where, in the marketplace of ideas, the best ideas - not those aided by censorship - will naturally prevail among the competition. Of course, there are limits to free speech. But, for too long, Big Tech giants (including, Twitter, Google, YouTube and Facebook) have subjected their conservative and Christian users to all forms of censorship, desperately trying to silence our voices. So if, as it seems, Mr. Musk will level the playing field for conservatives and Christians and allow a true exchange of ideas to occur on his platform, then we look forward to our chance to re-engage on Twitter. Please SIGN and SHARE this petition to the new owner of Twitter, Elon Musk, asking him to reactivate LifeSiteNews\' truth-telling Twitter accounts which have been suspended since early 2021. They are: https://twitter.com/LifeSite\n\nhttps://twitter.com/LSNCatholic\n\nhttps://twitter.com/WCDM_LSN\n\nhttps://twitter.com/WCEA_LSN These accounts have been blocked by the outgoing Twitter regime for more than a year for calling a ‘transgender woman’ (Assistant Secretary of Health, \'Rachel\' Levine), a man, and for tweeting an article about the same person. The article we tweeted makes mention of the troubling paradox of having a person who denies the basic science of the human anatomy be in an authoritative position in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), but does not cast aspersions or any other such “hate speech” against Levine, according to Twitter’s "rules." It is our fervant hope that Mr. Musk intends to allow - rather than censor - our descriptions of reality as we know them to be true in regards to human sexuality, as well as in other areas of life. Mr. Musk evidently understands how significant freedom of speech is to the functioning of a free society as he was quoted as saying that this deal is important for "the future of civlization." LifeSiteNews believes that being able to spread the truth in charity is absolutely vital for the future of society, as the "truth shall make you free." (Jn 8:32) And so, in order for us to charitably spread the truth far and wide, we now seek to re-engage on Twitter\'s public square. Thank you for SIGNING and SHARING this petition to Elon Musk, urging him to now reinstate LifeSiteNews\' suspended Twitter accounts.

The New Democrats have cozied up to Trudeau in order to pretend they are a sane and legitimate party and have promised to prop up his regime. Promises don’t really mean anything when politicians make them, so we shouldn’t assume that the communists will be loyal to each other.\n\nHowever, it is obvious that public opinion is against Trudeau to a degree that he will not be able to withstand.\n\nThere is a reason why Trudeau had to resort to the Emergencies Act to squash the Freedom Convoy; no one wanted to stop it until they were forced to by law.\n\nThe various levels of provincial and municipal governance could have stopped the movement the way they stop any non-violent protest – but they didn’t want to.\n\nDoes this mean that the cops and all the citizens supported the convoy? Of course not, but I think that enough of them saw how absurd things have become and just wanted something to make the whole charade of 2020-2021-2022 go away.\n\nThe application of the Emergencies Act was wildly unpopular among Canadians, both on the Left and the Right. Leftists were happy to see the movement end but were unimpressed that Trudeau ended it in such an absurd way. Conservatives generally supported the movement, and therefore saw Trudeau as a complete lunatic for doing what he did.\n\nAll of this means that in the long run Trudeau is hurting his reputation, even among his base. This is not news for him as the Conservative leadership race heats up.\n\nFreedom is on the move\n\nWithout giving the impression that I think Canada is on the brink of some massive societal restoration, I would be remiss if I did not speak to the positives.\n\nCurrently, we are witnessing the first real Conservative leadership race in a long time. Pierre Pollievre is filling arenas and convention centres with freedom-loving crowds, and Leslyn Lewis is making leftist journalists look silly on national TV. It is worth remembering that we are talking about a leadership race, not an election, but the swell of right-wing uprising is palpable.\n\nIn fact, the last time something like this happened was after a groundswell of Christian/right-wing sentiment following years of leftist oppression under the former Trudeau and his successors.\n\nAs a result of that, we had Stephen Harper for a decade who, although not perfect, was a saint compared with Trudeau.\n\nThe economy is tanking in Canada, and goods and services are becoming prohibitively expensive for average people. Trudeau and his cronies can appeal to idealism and progressivism all they want, but even left-wingers get ticked off and want change when they are struggling to fill the tank.\n\nUltimately, Trudeau is continuing to trap vaccine-free Canadians from participating fully in society because he knows that if he pulls the plug on his last failing restriction, that his regime will go down the drain.\n\nKennedy Hall is an Ontario based journalist for LifeSiteNews.

Jody Hice (R-Ga.), in all caps. A Twitter survey by Sen. Ted Cruz asked if Musk’s purchase was a good thing, with the only options to answer being “yes” or “no, I hate free speech.” His fellow Texan, Rep. John Carter, signaled his approval with no words at all; three clapping-hands emojis were sufficient.\n\nA pot-smoking, meme-posting evangelist for electric vehicles may be an unlikely hero for conservatives. But the Tesla chief executive’s amorphous vow to restore free speech to the social media platform has resonated among Republicans, who see themselves — starting with their de facto leader, former President Trump — as unfairly targeted by Twitter’s content moderation efforts.\n\nConservatives said their euphoric outpouring was bigger than the possible return of @RealDonaldTrump and changes to Twitter’s ownership. Rather, they see Musk’s takeover as a symbolic, and cathartic, blow against Big Tech, which the right has increasingly viewed with antipathy.\n\n“There’s a gut reaction from a lot of people, going, ‘You know what, it’s about time they get their comeuppance,’ ” said Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.). “It finally feels like someone is standing up for a principle that has been going in an opposite direction lately: less free speech, less ability to express yourself — if you are a conservative.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk centered his bid for Twitter on the premise that the social media company, which he considers a “digital town square,” is too restrictive in clamping down on expression.\n\n“I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” Musk tweeted Monday morning.\n\nMusk’s own politics are idiosyncratic. He’s the foremost face of clean vehicles who called for immediately increasing oil and gas production after the Ukraine-Russia war spiked energy prices. He fled California for Texas because of high taxes but declined to weigh in on Texas’ restrictive abortion law, saying he preferred to “stay out of politics.” He has described himself as politically independent and registered to vote in California with no party preference.\n\nFor conservatives, Musk’s crusade against content restrictions has struck a chord. Roughly half of Republicans feel they cannot express themselves freely on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, according to a Morning Consult poll conducted this month, far exceeding the percentage of Democrats and independents who felt similarly.\n\nPolitics Who did Twitter ban during the Trump era, and why? Could banned Trump allies return to Twitter under Elon Musk? A look at the former president’s backers who were kicked off the social media platform.\n\n“Twitter is a platform that I and many others believe has been more aggressive in blocking Republicans and conservatives than they have toward people on the left,” said Rep. Austin Scott (R-Ga.). “I’m hoping and expecting he will undo that.”\n\nScott is not an avid Twitter user; he does not even have the app on his phone. But he did tweet a congratulatory message to Musk, adding a plea to “restore free speech and bring back President Trump!”\n\nTrump was permanently kicked off the platform on Jan. 8, 2021 — two days after a group of his supporters overran the U.S. Capitol in hopes of blocking the certification of Joe Biden’s win. Twitter imposed the ban “due to the risk of further incitement of violence.”\n\nSo far, Musk has not indicated how he’d handle the former president’s account. Trump, meanwhile, has shown no interest in rejoining the platform that helped power his political rise and gave real-time narration of his presidency.\n\n“I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,” Trump told Fox News, referring to his fledgling social media network. “I hope Elon buys Twitter, because he’ll make improvements to it, and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth.”\n\nRepublicans see Trump as just one example of Twitter’s bias. A number of high-profile conservatives have been suspended or blocked from the platform, including the account of the Babylon Bee, a satirical news website that was suspended for a tweet naming Assistant Health Secretary Rachel Levine, who is transgender, “Man of the Year.”\n\nThe account was locked as a violation of Twitter’s ban on hate speech. Seth Dillon, CEO of Babylon Bee, refused to remove the tweet, asserting that “truth is not hate speech.”\n\n“It’s completely broken,” said Harmeet Dhillon, a conservative lawyer who has sued Twitter multiple times on behalf of clients who were banned. “The company can try to affect elections, try to ban politicians from speaking ... use algorithms, enable false accounts to constantly affect what people see.”\n\nThe extent to which conservatives face bias on the platform has been fiercely examined and debated. A study this month by researchers at MIT and Yale found that Republican users tend to be suspended more often than Democrats but that conservatives are more likely to share misinformation that would provoke such suspensions.\n\nSo far, Musk has offered little explanation as to how his free speech values would play out in practice. He said on Monday that his goals include “enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots and authenticating all humans.”\n\nBut such efforts would require some attempt at regulating content, especially by verifying users. A social media network without any moderation at all could swamp the platform with all sorts of unsavory or offensive material, such as pornography or terrorist content, as well as the online abuse and harassment that are already common occurrences.\n\n“If you don’t have content moderation, you actually have less free speech. The people who are the loudest are the bullies and harassers that drive people away,” said Katie Harbath, a former Republican operative who has worked as public policy director for Facebook.\n\nDhillon, the conservative attorney based in California, said she is not hoping for Musk to completely abandon regulation.\n\n“There’s plenty of room for them to do old-school content moderation of the kind they originally did,” she said, citing as an example prohibitions on making death threats.\n\nWith Musk’s plans still unknown, Harbath, who now runs a tech policy strategy firm, said the celebratory conservatives “are making a hell of a lot of assumptions of what Elon means by all this stuff. I don’t think they should assume he is completely on their side.”\n\nRepublicans’ triumphant tone on Twitter starkly contrasted with the more muted reaction from liberal politicians. Far fewer Democratic members of Congress weighed in on Twitter, although those who did were markedly unenthused.\n\n“This deal is dangerous for our democracy. Billionaires like Elon Musk play by a different set of rules than everyone else, accumulating power for their own gain. We need a wealth tax and strong rules to hold Big Tech accountable,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), with whom Musk has sparred on Twitter.\n\nHuizenga, the Michigan congressman, expected that liberals would be none too pleased with Musk’s purchase. Indeed, some vowed to leave the site entirely — much to Huizenga’s amusement.\n\n“It seems like ‘I’m quitting Twitter’ has become the ‘I’m moving to Canada if Trump wins,’ ” he said, adding, “It’s kind of fun sitting back, watching them completely lose their collective minds.”', 'image': 'https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ac14b68/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2941x1544+0+208/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F86%2F23%2Ff46440b54bd7a6509db9c67caab5%2Fphilanthropy-billionaries-tax-28080.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:57'}

(Patrick Pleul/Pool/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nElon Musk Reveals More Details of His Plans for Twitter After Buyout\n\nElon Musk revealed more details of what he has in mind for changes at Twitter after it was confirmed that the company had accepted his buyout offer, with the tech mogul’s plans including new features and ways to enhance trust in the platform.\n\nTwitter’s board of directors said on April 25 that it had approved Musk’s offer to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share in cash, in a deal worth around $44 billion.\n\nThe buyout represents a 38 percent premium over Twitter’s closing stock price on April 1, with Parag Agrawal, CEO of Twitter, saying in a statement that he believes the deal “is the best path forward for Twitter’s stockholders.”\n\n‘Bedrock of a Functioning Democracy’\n\nIn a statement, Musk provided some details about what kind of changes he has in mind for the social media platform, whose commitment to free speech he has repeatedly called into question.\n\n“Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,” Musk said. This dovetails with his earlier statements that Twitter functions as a “de facto town square” where important conversations should be able to take place with as few constraints as possible.\n\nMusk said Monday that Twitter has “tremendous potential” and that he wants to work with the company and its users to “unlock” and make the platform “better than ever.”\n\nHe said he plans on “enhancing” Twitter with new features, which he did not provide further details on. Musk earlier created a Twitter poll asking users if they want an edit button on the platform, suggesting that this could be one of the changes he is seeking to effect.\n\nMusk also said on Monday he wants to make the platform’s algorithms “open source to increase trust,” while “defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.”\n\nThis, too, reinforces his earlier remarks that his objective in seeking to buy Twitter and turn it into a private company was to transform it into a bastion of free speech by opening up its algorithm to public scrutiny and by making its moderation policies more transparent.\n\n‘Black Box Algorithm’\n\nA self-described “free speech absolutist,” Musk told the audience at a recent TED event in Vancouver, Canada, that Twitter should permit unconstrained expression, though it should do so in line with the law.\n\n“In my view, Twitter should match the laws of the country,” Musk said, acknowledging reasonable legal caps on free speech like direct incitement to violence or shouting “fire” in a crowded theater.\n\n“But going beyond that and having it be unclear who’s making what changes to where, having tweets mysteriously be promoted and demoted with no insight into what’s going on, having a black box algorithm promote some things and not other things, I think this can be quite dangerous,” Musk said.\n\n“My strong, intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization,” he added.\n\nErr on Side of Free Speech\n\nMusk also expressed reluctance about permanent bans of users from Twitter, preferring instead temporary “time-outs.”\n\n“I’m not saying that I have all the answers here,” Musk said at the TED talk. But I do think that we want to be just very reluctant to delete things, just be very cautious with permanent bans. Timeouts I think are better than permanent bans.”\n\nIn terms of calibrating Twitter’s moderation policies, Musk said he’d want to err on the side of free speech.\n\n“If in doubt, let the speech, let it exist,” Musk said. “If it’s a grey area, I would say let the tweet exist. But obviously in a case where there’s perhaps a lot of controversy, that you would not want to necessarily promote that tweet.”\n\n“A good sign as to whether there’s free speech is, is someone you don’t like allowed to say something you don’t like,” Musk said. “And if that is the case, then we have free speech.”\n\n‘We Are Concerned’\n\nMusk has repeatedly questioned Twitter’s commitment to free speech, after accusations that the platform suppressed some minority and politically conservative viewpoints, claims Twitter has denied.\n\nMany free speech advocates have hailed Musk’s takeover bid, while those opposed have expressed fear that fewer constraints on expression on Twitter will make it too easy to abuse the platform’s reach and power by, for example, spreading disinformation.\n\nIn a series of tweets reacting to Musk’s takeover moves, Amnesty International expressed concern about the erosion of policies meant to protect users.\n\n“We are concerned with any steps that Twitter might take to erode enforcement of the policies and mechanisms designed to protect users,” Amnesty International wrote.\n\n“The last thing we need is a Twitter that wilfully turns a blind eye to violent and abusive speech against users,” the group said.\n\nAs it was confirmed Musk would purchase Twitter, the Tesla founder urged his “worst critics” to stay on the platform.\n\n“I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” he wrote in a Twitter post.\n\nDan Ives, an analyst at investment firm Wedbush Securities, told the BBC that he expects most users will take a “wait-and-see approach” on whether they stay or leave the platform, based on the changes that take place.\n\n“Now it’s about courting new users and stopping defectors from the platform,” Ives told the outlet.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/19/article-image-cal-thomas-3-1200x804.jpeg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:50'}

This feels like the first flashback scene we see in a dystopian drama after the words “SIX MONTHS EARLIER …” Quite where we’ll be in six months’ time as far as Twitter is concerned remains tantalisingly unclear, but it seems difficult to imagine it will be either a more or less pleasant space. It’s a social media platform. I’m not sure what further evidence humanity needs before we cotton on to the idea that such a thing might be an intrinsically toxic concept. Of course, there will always be some people who think it just hasn’t been done right yet. Like communism, or a British version of The Daily Show.\n\nAnyway, if Musk’s takeover goes through, he’ll assume control of a platform where the people on the right are incredibly angry about free speech, and those on the left are incredibly angry about hate speech. Which is to say: they have so much in common. As the tech visionary Jaron Lanier has long been excellent at pointing out, the best way to keep people on platforms is to make them angry. So the platforms are designed to make them angry. You might consider the anger worth it for your version of advertising (I myself will post this column on Twitter), but even then it is a weirdly grim cost of doing business that just conceivably ought to be weighed far more carefully than it is.\n\nUnlike the UK, Musk manufactures other things besides anger, but Twitter is the platform where, in a single calendar year, his posts led to multiple lawsuits, a fall in his stock price, and a Securities and Exchange Commission settlement that resulted in his chairmanship of Tesla being forcibly ended. Yet in a move that will feel familiar to a lot of Twitter users, he has not logged off, but leaned in further. When I was a child, there was a guy called Victor Kiam who owned Remington, and he would personally feature in the firm’s electric razor adverts, going: “I liked the shaver so much, I bought the company.” It would be nice to see Musk do something similar. “I liked calling innocent people paedos so much, I bought the company.”\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the distress of Twitter users feels overplayed. Perhaps Elon embodies a kind of radical honesty and self-awareness not shared by other denizens of the site. People who seem to spend half their lives complaining about Twitter, on Twitter, seem stunned by the idea that a shitposter would ultimately buy it. Catch up! It doesn’t feel like a complete coincidence that all social media platforms are owned by men you’d run a mile from socially.\n\nMusk is one of them – a brilliant, horrid, ridiculous and very occasionally endearing grotesque. A sort of intergalactically successful Dominic Cummings. And yet, despite Elon’s give-a-toss gift for making himself what Twitter users might call the “main character”, I can’t detest him entirely. If he pulls off the radical green energy transition embodied in Tesla, or even just one of his other wildly ambitious schemes, humans might have to accept some of the shit that’s gone with it. Accept it angrily, of course – how else, we’re on a social media platform! – but accept it nonetheless. A huge number of other people in public life behave appallingly and achieve absolutely nothing but harm.\n\nBut if endlessly righteous folk balk at the mere idea of necessary evils, why do they act like their own involvement in Twitter is one? It isn’t. It’s easy to focus on the high-profile people who are always on Twitter. But the sheer numbers of highly successful, highly creative and highly interesting people in the worlds of arts, business, science and beyond who AREN’T on it should tell a much more powerful story. They are part of all kinds of era-defining creative and commercial conversations and breakthroughs – and somehow manage to do it all without lavishing half the day scrolling past a bunch of other people having a row.\n\nLanier has cast detailed doubt on whether most Twitter advocacy is even meaningfully effective, despite sometimes appearing to be so. If you spend your day caught up in online fighting, it’s preferable to tell yourself you’re involved in consciousness-raising for your cause. An alternative view is that you are simply obsessively polarising your particular debate, to the point where compromise – boring, unfashionable, yet historically always necessary – becomes a more distant possibility.\n\nMy “unpopular opinion”, in one of Twitter’s tellingly popular phrases, is that those who spend a significant amount of time arguing on it work for the platform and not for their cause. The Musk takeover at least makes it easier to see whose pocket you’re putting money into as you delude yourself you’re winning arguments. I’m certainly not saying I follow this rule, but in general I think arguing on the internet is like playing real tennis: even if you win, you’re still a twat.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5899b28a3a52d992407b1aa95d2689c2b1d4703f/0_273_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=e4d7eefe6e510bd81cf93360935a1d81', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:53'}

Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) and Mike Braun (R-Ind.) at an April 26 Senate Committee on Appropriations hearing.\n\n“As I said during my nomination hearing, the investigation is being run by and supervised by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware. He [David Weiss] is supervising the investigation, and I’m not at liberty to talk about internal DOJ deliberations—but he is in charge of that investigation, and there will not be interference of any political or improper kind,” Garland said, also declining to comment on whether other senior DOJ officials have been briefed.\n\nHagerty expressed skepticism at Garland’s promise, given recent statements from the White House regarding Hunter Biden’s innocence.\n\n“I wonder why the president is resorting to go to TV and … his surrogates. Earlier this month, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain said on TV that the president is confident that his son didn’t break the law, and the White House communications director said President Biden maintains his position that his son did nothing that was unethical,” Hagerty said.\n\nThe senator asked Garland whether U.S. President Joe Biden had told him his son is innocent.\n\n“Absolutely not,” Garland responded. “He has not done that, and he has committed to not interfere in the investigation.”\n\nHagerty pressed further, asking Garland how the public could be confident there won’t be political interference in the investigation.\n\n“Because we put a Trump appointee in charge of the investigation,” Garland said, referring to Weiss. “And because you have me as attorney general, who’s committed to the independence of the DOJ from any influence from the White House.”\n\nHagerty then asked Garland whether the DOJ was considering assigning a special counsel to investigate Hunter Biden. Garland again declined to comment.\n\nWhen asked under what circumstances a special counsel would be used in the investigation, Garland said, “it depends on the circumstances.”\n\nBraun asked similar questions about a potential special counsel and received similar responses.\n\n“The question is an internal DOJ matter,” Garland repeated. “I don’t want to make judgments, but I’m comfortable with the Attorney from Delaware continuing.”\n\nThe federal investigation into Hunter Biden’s finances was revealed in December 2020, and few updates have been provided since then.\n\nAttorney Clint Lancaster, who represented an Arkansas woman who filed the lawsuit in 2019 alleging that Hunter Biden was the father of her daughter Navy Joan Roberts, told CBS News earlier this month that federal prosecutors subpoenaed the documents from his case.\n\n“They wanted every record relating to Hunter Biden we had,” he said of the paternity case, which was settled in 2020.\n\nLancaster said the records included Hunter Biden’s “affidavit of financial means” during the paternity lawsuit. A financial affidavit is generally a statement showing income, expenses, assets, and liabilities.\n\nAdditionally, he said the tax records he and Roberts provided overlapped during the same time period as Hunter Biden’s foreign business activities.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/1.tagreuters.com2022binary_LYNXNPEI3510J-FILEDIMAGE-1200x833.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:47'}

Legal experts have said a special counsel is necessary because Joe Biden has denied any wrongdoing by Hunter and may have influenced the ongoing investigation.\n\n“The question of whether they have a special counsel is one that is an internal decision-making within the department, so I don’t want to make any judgments one way or the other,” Garland responded. “But I’m quite comfortable with the United States attorney for that district continuing in the role that he’s [Weiss] playing.”\n\nDuring the 2020 presidential debate, Joe Biden claimed Hunter’s “laptop from hell” was a Russian plant “and a smear campaign.” Joe Biden has repeatedly claimed he was never involved in the family business.\n\nJoe Biden said the emails on Hunter’s laptop were a “Russian plant” and “a smear campaign.” Today new emails indicate that Biden was PAYING Hunter’s bills for a deal with a Chinese government-controlled entity. pic.twitter.com/K3Ojf3SyIg — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) April 26, 2022\n\nBut according to White House visitor logs obtained by the New York Post on Saturday, Hunter’s corrupt business partner, Eric Schwerin, met with Joe Biden at the White House 19 times between 2009 and 2015. Joe Biden was vice president during this time. The contact between Joe Biden and Schwerin directly contradicts Joe Biden’s repeated claims he was never involved in the family business. The Post’s reporting adds a twelfth instance Joe Biden has been involved in the family’s business scheme.\n\nDOOCY: "The President has said that he never spoke to his son about his overseas business dealings. Is that still the case?"

Sixty percent say Hunter Biden has sold “influence and access” to Joe Biden. The poll also shows 67 percent believe Joe Biden should be impeached if he “secretly participated and facilitated” in the family’s business.\n\nText messages from 2019 on Hunter’s “laptop from hell” depict the Biden family payout mechanism. The instrument indicates a collection of 50 percent of familial salaries for 30 years.\n\n“I hope you all can do what I did and pay for everything for this entire family for 30 years,” Hunter texted to his daughter in 2019. “It’s really hard. But don’t worry, unlike Pop [Joe], I won’t make you give me half your salary.”\n\nThe Biden’s family payment mechanism of collecting 50 percent of family salaries for 30 years could be legal “predicates” for racketeering charges, according to former Utah U.S. attorney Brett Tolman.\n\nFollow Wendell Husebø on Twitter and Gettr @WendellHusebø.

Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.) told reporters following the meeting.\n\n“We are in a different position now than we were in the past,” he said. “There’s ample vaccines available. There is the ability to test and quarantine that work. And so, Title 42 should be lifted, and that we should focus on border management policy in order to make sure that they have the resources in order to move forward.”\n\nBut the administration’s plans to stop enforcing Title 42 were thrown into doubt as the meeting came to a close. A Trump-appointed federal judge in Louisiana said he planned to block the administration’s plans for rescinding the public health order, a win for a group of GOP-led states who sued to stop Biden from moving forward.\n\nThe meeting punctuated internal disagreement in the Democratic Party around the Biden administration’s decision to end enforcement of the Title 42 authority, a public health order that allows border officials to speedily turn away migrants at the U.S. southern border.\n\nImmigration advocates have a litany of concerns about the policy, but at the center of those issues is that it allows officials to forego asylum screenings, blocking persecuted migrants from exercising a right they have under U.S. law.\n\nWhile many support the Biden administration’s decision and indeed wish it had come sooner, others have expressed concern about the plans amid a prolonged spike in border crossings.\n\n“Yes they’re listening to the immigration activists, but my question is who’s listening to the men and women in green and in blue and, more importantly, who is listening to the border communities – the sheriffs, the landowners, the rest of the people who live on the border?” Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), who represents a border community and has raised concerns about the policy decision, said on “Fox News Sunday.”\n\nRep. Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.), who was tasked with presenting the group’s position on Title 42 to Biden, said the meeting touched on a series of issues before turning to immigration, an issue that still led coverage of the meeting.\n\n“The reality is when you talk to Latinos they’re talking about the economy, jobs, air pollution, and so the media is talking about things that are divisive,” said Barragán.\n\nBarragán added that the CHC puts more blame over the immigration policy crisis on former President Trump than on Biden.\n\n“The bottom line is this president walked into a tough situation with a prior administration who dismantled the legal immigration system,” she said.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the meeting was part of Biden’s outreach to individual congressional caucuses. Biden has recently met with the Congressional Progressive Caucus as well as other groups in Congress.\n\nAttendees said that it also covered the implementation of the bipartisan infrastructure law, immigration reform, and environmental justice.\n\nAt one point, an aide to the president walked into the room with a note saying the 30-minute meeting had gone on for 62 minutes.\n\nBiden, rather than keep the information to himself, read the note out loud to laughter from the attendees.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House is facing pressure from immigration advocates to forcefully oppose a bill that has attracted support from moderate senators that would delay an end to the enforcement of Title 42. The White House has not taken a position on the legislation.\n\n“I just wish that the Biden administration would stand up and explain what it’s doing and own it,” said Clara Long, associate director at Human Rights Watch who focuses on immigration and border policy.\n\nPsaki again on Monday said it would be up to Congress to make any changes to CDC’s Title 42 enforcement, but she declined to say whether Biden would sign legislation that did so.\n\n“This would be Congress having the discussion. We are continuing to prepare for a May 23 implementation,” Psaki said. “There will be a range of conversations about this over the coming days.”\n\nThe lawsuits filed by GOP-led states seem to be the biggest immediate threat to the administration’s plans. Some have speculated that the White House would like to see the courts thwart their plans in order to take a hot-button political issue off Biden’s plate.\n\n“I think there’s a theory going around that they’re hoping the courts give them a get-out-of-jail-free card,” said Long.\n\nBiden’s approval ratings are particularly low on his handling of immigration.\n\nA Politico/Morning Consult poll conducted earlier this month found that 54 percent of registered voters oppose Biden’s decision to lift Title 42.\n\nBut a different poll conducted in February by Impact Research for the National Immigration Law Center found that 52 percent of likely 2022 voters support ending Title 42 enforcement.\n\nStill, most CHC members believe that the administration can push forward with its vision of border policy, because Republicans are unlikely to relent from attacking Biden on immigration and the border.\n\n“No matter what the president does, they’re going to make noise. The president and the Democratic-controlled Congress have done amazing things, that’s why econ has improved,” said Rep. Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.), who attended the meeting.\n\n“Republicans don’t want to focus on the glass that’s half full, they want to convince us the glass is half empty,” he added.\n\nSome advocates for ending the policy, which they say represented one prong of the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant agenda, argue that Democrats are risking turning off their base by voicing support for continuing the policy.\n\n“This is a policy that can help you win and the flipside of that is embracing the Republican talking points is not going to help you win those Democratic voters that you desperately need to turn out for you in November,” said Bri Gillis, political director of the National Immigration Law Center’s Immigrant Justice Fund.\n\nStill, some Democrats say the discussion of Title 42 is moot.\n\n“There’s nothing to debate, you’re either for Title 42 or you’re not,” said Rep. Lou Correa (D-Calif.), a CHC member who did not attend the meeting.\n\n“Everybody’s talking abt Title 42 when that’s not the issue. The real issue is American industrial might, nearshoring of American jobs from China, creating a stronger manufacturing base, and a lot of that relies on immigrants. And we’re talking about Title 42. Doesn’t even come close to addressing the bigger public policy issues in this country and that’s what everybody’s talking about. And it’s hurting us,” said Correa.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/ruizraul_031821gn_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:41'}

So remember to get your booster!” Murphy tweeted.\n\nSimmons, Harris’ communications director, tested positive for the virus after attending the April 2 Gridiron dinner, a traditional white-tie gathering of reporters and politicians that features light roasts and songs.\n\nAtty.

We will be very transparent with you if that were to happen,” Psaki said.\n\nShe added though that she thinks Biden would be able to continue his presidential duties if he were to test positive.\n\n“He has access to the best health care in the world, and we believe, because of all the precautions and steps we have taken that he would be able to continue his duties, as the vice president is as well as vice president,” she said.\n\nOfficials stress that he is vaccinated, and Psaki said last week last week that it wouldn’t be a failure of the precautions in place to protect Biden if he were to get the virus.\n\nPsaki on Tuesday told reporters not to expect updates to protocols, including masking protocols, within the White House in light of Harris’ positive test.\n\nShe noted there is a regular testing cadence for the president and vice president, as well as officials around them, and that there is social distancing in meetings and a number of aides choose to wear masks.\n\nUpdated at 4:09 p.m.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/harriskamala_031522_ap_manuel_balce_ceneta.jpeg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:41'}

Kyrsten Sinema has confounded Democrats over budget talks – even while boasting about using her cleavage to reel in 'uptight' Republicans, according to a new book.\n\nSinema, a weight-lifter and fitness buff, regularly draws attention in the buttoned-down Senate hallways with her eclectic fashion choices.\n\nBut she has also developed ways to contend with Republicans in the minority, according to This Will Not Pass, a new book by New York Times reporters Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns.\n\nDespite being more 'discomfiting' to the White House than any Democrat in the 50-50 Senate, Sinema had relationships across the political aisle. The former House member, who is the first bisexual member of the Senate, 'joked with Democrats about how easy it was for her to charm Republican men,' according to the book.\n\n'Sinema, a fitness enthusiast who was 36 when she entered Congress, boasted knowingly to colleagues and aides that her cleavage had an extraordinary persuasive effect on the uptight men of the GOP. She told one House Republican that while she would never switch parties, her father would be delighted if she did,' the authors write.\n\nSen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) 'boasted knowingly to colleagues and aides that her cleavage had an extraordinary persuasive effect on the uptight men of the GOP,' according to a new book\n\nThe book also delves into President Joe Biden's governing woes – including prolonged talks with Sinema, whom the authors dub an 'aloof Arizonan.' She became a progressive nemesis when she and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) wouldn't go along with Biden's multi-trillion proposals, although she did cheer his infrastructure plan.\n\nAfter Biden signed the infrastructure bill, Sinema asked Biden's aides not to send the president to her home state for a 'victory lap,' even though he had won Arizona in 2020. White House aides were concluding she was 'simply a difficult person.'\n\nThe book describes one early 2021 dinner with Senate Republicans after the election where where the Republicans asked Sinema to join – and she requested to be able to enter through a back door to avoid being seen.\n\nShe has won praise from Republicans for her opposition to changing the Senate filibuster, and a line of Republicans congratulated her on the Senate floor after voting with the GOP on a move to advance the Democratic leadership backed voting rights legislation.\n\nThe book, which grabbed headlines with revelations about House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, also contains details about former President Donald Trump and his election overturn effort.\n\nSinema confounded Democrats during months-long negotiations\n\nSinema previously served in the House. Here, she and Trey Hollingsworth, R-Ind., talk before a House Financial Services Committee hearing in 2018\n\nSinema asked Biden's aides not to send the president to her home state for a 'victory lap' after Biden signed the infrastructure bill, according to the book\n\nTrump's belief that he could prevail extended well after the time he left the White House and decamped to Mar-a-Lago.\n\nAnd it wasn't just Donald Trump's most passionate adherents who believed in the 'reinstatement' myth – the former President himself was saying last spring he would be reinstalled within months, the book reveals.\n\nTrump stated his belief in the theory in May of 2021, four months after leaving office, according to the book.\n\nThe idea of a Trump reinstatement was being promoted at the time by My Pillow exec Mike Lindell and QAnon adherents, although it would ultimately be believed by nearly a third of Republicans in a June Politico / Morning Consult survey.\n\nTrump phoned National Review editor Rich Lowry to tell him that the magazine 'would take off like a rocket if it recognized that he had actually won the election,' according to the book.\n\n'In fact, Trump told Lowry, he expected to be reinstated by August, and Republicans would be put back in charge of the Senate once the supposedly pervasive corruption of the 2020 election was exposed.'\n\nFormer President Donald Trump told columnist Rich Lowry in May 2021 he expected to be reinstated within months, according to a new book\n\nThe Senate had flipped to Democratic control in 2000 after two Democratic wins in Georgia.\n\nThere is no provision in the Constitution for 'reinstatement' once election results have been certified by the states and Congress has counted the electoral votes and the president and lawmakers have been sworn into office.\n\n(Lowry may have been an odd target for Trump's lobbying. He had called the Capitol riot in a Jan. 6th column a 'disgrace,' where he wrote that 'one point of the riot was to further pressure Pence (“Hang Mike Pence!”), but much of the lobbying took place behind closed doors, among Trump’s advisers.')\n\nTrump also took a shot at now Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. 'It was beyond belief, Trump said, that Mitch McConnell did not seem to understand this,' according to the book.\n\n'The president's comments were pure madness,' the authors write.\n\nCongress ultimately counted the votes certified by the states following the Capitol riot. Joe Biden took the oath Jan. 20th after Trump left the White House\n\nTrump has been spending time at Mar-a-Lago and holding rallies around the country while dangling the possibility of a return to the White House\n\nThere have been multiple reports on Trump's interest in getting 'reinstated.'\n\nAfter Trump withdrew his endorsement of Alabama GOP Rep. Mo Brooks, Brooks released a statement saying Trump had approached him with the idea.\n\n'President Trump asked me to rescind the 2020 elections, immediately remove Joe Biden from the White House, immediately put President Trump back in the White House, and hold a new special election for the presidency,' Brooks said in a statement.\n\n'As a lawyer, I’ve repeatedly advised President Trump that January 6 was the final election contest verdict and neither the U.S. Constitution nor the U.S. Code permit what President Trump asks. Period,' he added.\n\n'I’ve told President Trump the truth knowing full well that it might cause President Trump to rescind his endorsement. But I took a sworn oath to defend and protect the U.S. Constitution. I honor my oath. That is the way I am. I break my sworn oath for no man.'\n\nTrump took back his endorsement in the Alabama Senate primary, citing Brooks' call for people to put the 2020 election 'behind you.'\n\nLindell, who was advised Trump inside the White House in the last days of his presidency, has also repeatedly touted the idea.\n\nOther passages in the book reveal how Vice President Kamala Harris quickly learned not to come between President Biden and his negotiations with Congress.\n\nThe authors recount one episode where the president snapped at her so harshly even Republican senators in the meeting were shocked.\n\nIn a meeting last May, Biden tried to persuade Republican lawmakers to support $1 trillion in infrastructure spending.\n\nAnd while Biden was ready for a compromise, Harris thought the bill was skimpy.\n\n'Harris thought that there was something missing from the conversation,' according to the book.\n\nShe began turning the conversation toward Democratic priorities, including family and social spending, which were originally included in the larger Build Back Better bill.\n\nShe 'began to make the case for a larger package than the one Republicans seemed to have in mind.'\n\n'Biden dismissed her comment immediately,' the authors wrote, in so harsh a tone 'that even the Republican senators were taken aback.'\n\nBiden was typically 'scrupulously respectful' of his second-in-command, but the moment revealed that infrastructure negotiations were his and his alone.", 'image': 'https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/26/17/57074033-0-image-a-35_1650989503049.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:57:00'}

After months in short supply, federal officials say the medications are now more widely available, yet are being underused.\n\nAs part of the new effort, the federal government plans to allow thousands of more pharmacies to directly order highly effective COVID-19 treatments like Pfizer\'s Paxlovid antiviral pills, which can reduce the risk of becoming severely ill. They also plan to launch additional "test-to-treat" sites, where Americans can get diagnosed and receive the pills in a single visit.\n\nPaxlovid was first authorized by the Food and Drug Administration in December, and supplies were hard to come by at first. Now the pills are no longer scarce, but they still aren\'t getting to everyone who might benefit from treatment.\n\n"It\'s pretty clear from the uptake of Paxlovid, and the rate of hospitalizations and deaths over the months that Paxlovid has been available, that there are still some folks who could have benefited from these medications," an administration official told reporters on Monday in a briefing to preview the announcement.\n\nFederal officials have voiced concerns publicly for weeks that treatments like Paxlovid, Merck and Ridgeback\'s Lagevrio antiviral pills, and Eli Lilly\'s bebtelovimab monoclonal antibody drug were not reaching enough Americans.\n\nOfficials said Monday that reported use of the antiviral pills has more than doubled over the past month, from 22,000 courses a week to over 55,000. That comes as cases and hospitalizations have begun to climb nationwide, driven by the highly-contagious Omicron BA.2 subvariant.\n\nIn New England, federal data has tracked the pace of new COVID-19 hospitalizations surging among patients 70 and older — the age group most vulnerable to severe COVID-19 — since the beginning of April. The rate of new admissions is now higher than the peak reached over the Delta variant wave last year, but remains a fraction of the record highs during the winter Omicron wave.\n\n"We certainly know that there\'s more room to go. We can save more lives by giving this medication to more people," said the official.\n\nGetting Paxlovid antiviral pills\n\nPaxlovid treatment needs to begin within a few days of first developing symptoms.\n\nA course of treatment is made up of three tablets that are taken twice a day, in the morning and evening, over the course of five days, for a total of 30 pills. Initial clinical trials showed the drug reduced the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization or death by 88%, compared to placebo.\n\nPaxlovid cannot be taken at the same time as several medications that can reduce the drug\'s efficacy or lead to potentially fatal side effects.\n\nThrough outreach to doctors and patients, officials say they hope more eligible Americans will act quickly to get the now-plentiful antiviral pills sitting on pharmacy shelves.\n\nPfizer\'s COVID-19 drug Paxlovid Fabian Sommer/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\n"A lot of providers early on in that scarcity mindset, when there were fewer courses available across the country, were really reserving this for only the folks who they thought would be the sickest of the sick," an administration official told reporters.\n\nOn Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health alert urging doctors to step up prescribing of effective COVID-19 treatments — and imploring at-risk patients who test positive not to delay in contacting their doctors, "even if your symptoms are mild."\n\nA "tranche" of more than 100,000 courses of the antiviral pills will be made available to all of the federal government\'s pharmacy partners to order directly, instead of through federal and local allocations. Officials say they expect the move will raise the number of sites with drugs in stock from 20,000 to 30,000.\n\nThat comes on top of efforts like the administration\'s nationwide "test-to-treat initiative" launched at thousands of pharmacies earlier this year.\n\nFollowing concerns that the program was inaccessible to Americans living in many parts of the country, officials said the administration is planning to launch new "federally-supported Test-to-Treat sites" beyond the 2,200 locations currently in the program.\n\n"I think we\'re going to be working really closely with these new federally supported sites, work directly with state, territorial, and jurisdictional leadership to identify the places that need more support," said an administration official.\n\nChallenges and questions\n\nOfficials acknowledged that the new moves do not address some of the criticisms levied against the Biden administration\'s treatment effort.\n\nDespite objections from pharmacy trade groups, the FDA excludes most pharmacists from being able to prescribe Paxlovid or Lagevrio. For at-risk Americans without access to a "test-to-treat" drugstore that has a qualifying provider available, this means some will have to make multiple trips to get the pills.\n\n"You have to develop COVID symptoms, you have to subsequently get a test for COVID-19, get the result of that test, find and go to see a provider, get a prescription, and then fill that prescription. That\'s six steps in five days," said an official.\n\nIt also does not include an expansion to who is eligible to take the drugs under the FDA\'s emergency use authorization.\n\nSpeaking at Uniformed Services University earlier this month, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the president\'s chief medical adviser, hinted that Paxlovid might soon be expanded to lower-risk patients "in order to prevent them possibly from getting long COVID."\n\nBoth Pfizer and Merck have also been running a range of trials that might support expanding use of the antiviral pills to more people. Results could come soon from a trial assessing Paxlovid in people who are exposed to the disease, but have not yet developed symptoms, which was due to be completed earlier this month.\n\nAnd administration officials at the briefing did not bring up growing reports of "rebound" or "relapse" symptoms — people who appear to recover from COVID-19 after taking the antiviral pills, but later get a new round of symptoms — which might lead to SARS-CoV-2 evolving resistance to the treatments.\n\nA spokesperson for Pfizer said the company was continuing to monitor data from their clinical trials of Paxlovid as well as real-world evidence, and has "not seen any resistance" to the drug.\n\nIn a statement, an FDA spokesperson acknowledged that reports of rebound "are important to evaluate further," but reiterated that the drug appeared 88% effective at reducing the risk of hospitalization or death in its clinical trial.\n\n"The FDA is evaluating the reports of viral load rebound after completing Paxlovid treatment and will share recommendations if appropriate," said the FDA\'s Chanapa Tantibanchachai.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/04/26/75834f94-0c35-4873-8166-5e4b24cfa0d3/thumbnail/1200x630/5625e6265f72e4689718b2845b0511c4/gettyimages-1238865166.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:22'}

That is expected to increase the number of sites from 20,000 to more than 30,000 next week and eventually to 40,000 locations.\n\nHowever, according to a senior Biden administration official speaking anonymously to Axios, many states are ordering just two-thirds of what is available to them and are using half their orders.\n\nProviders are probably limiting access to the pill because “we’ve had the experience in this pandemic before of operating in a scarcity mindset,” another administration official said in a press conference.\n\nMany states have opted for a lottery system to allocate Paxlovid and other Covid-19 drugs, often choosing to distribute the drugs to retail pharmacies instead of hospitals and clinics.\n\nAccording to Dr Douglas White, a University of Pittsburgh critical care doctor who helped design Pennsylvania’s lottery system for Covid-19 drug allocation, the system ends up favoring people who are not only aware of the drugs but have access to doctors to prescribe it and the ability to locate pharmacies that have them in stock.\n\n“The wealthy and well-connected will win the race,” White told the Los Angeles Times. It’s “the poster child for an unfair system.”\n\nDespite the administration’s attempt to reassure providers that there are enough pills for patients, in an interview with NPR on Monday, the White House’s Covid-19 response coordinator, Dr Ashish Jha, said that there are only enough pills “for the short run.” As of Tuesday, the US had ordered enough supply of the pills for 20 million people, which is estimated to last for several more months.\n\n“Right now, we’ve done a really good job of acquiring pills,” Jha said, adding that the Biden administration will need additional funding from Congress to acquire more pills. “We have to make sure that this is more than a short-term solution.”\n\nJha warned that the US will be running out of money for Paxlovid “reasonably soon,” and that “we actually aren’t even going to be able to pay our bills for what we’ve already entered into a contract with Pfizer for, so that’s going to be a problem.”\n\nThe Biden administration is expected to renew its request to Congress for $22bn in Covid-19 funding.\n\nPaxlovid, when administered within five days of symptoms appearing, has been proven to bring about a 90% reduction in hospitalizations and deaths among patients most likely to get severe disease. About 350 Americans are now dying each day from Covid-19, down from more than 2,600 during the height of the Omicron wave earlier this year.\n\nThe FDA authorized Pfizer’s drug for emergency use in adults and children age 12 or older with a positive Covid-19 test and early symptoms who face the highest risk of severe outcomes. That includes older people and those with conditions like obesity and heart disease, though the drug is not recommended for patients with severe kidney or liver problems.\n\nThe administration is also working to expand the number of “test-to-treat” sites that provide a one-stop shop for those with Covid-19 to get tested for the virus, consult with a medical professional if they’re positive and fill a prescription for Paxlovid on site.\n\nThere are now 2,200 such locations nationwide, though the administration hopes more sites come online in the next several weeks with support from the Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and pharmacy companies.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ec9f8e72eff2d14c7cbb28bd8af41604fea72e5/0_301_5075_3047/master/5075.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=269eeb032fb24072e4c2185b17d3cc66', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:54'}

(Greg Nash/Pool/Getty Images)\n\nAttorney General: No Interference Allowed in Hunter Biden Investigation\n\nNo interference will be allowed into the Department of Justice’s investigation into President Joe Biden’s son, Attorney General Merrick Garland said on April 26.\n\n“There will not be interference of any political or improper kind,” Garland said during an appearance before a congressional panel.\n\nSen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) questioned Garland on the matter, pointing out that Joe Biden’s messengers, including White House chief of staff Ronald Klain, have said on national television that the president is confident his son, Hunter Biden, did nothing wrong.\n\n“The president’s already told his subordinates—clearly, these are people he can fire at will—that he and his family did nothing wrong. How can the American people be confident that his administration is conducting a serious investigation?” Hagerty asked.\n\n“Because we put the investigation in the hands of a Trump appointee, from the previous administration, who’s the United States attorney for the District of Delaware, and because you have me as the attorney general, who is committed to the independence of the Justice Department from any influence from the White House in criminal matters,” Garland, a Biden appointee, responded.\n\nThe probe was first revealed by Hunter Biden in late 2020. He claimed that prosecutors were investigating his “tax affairs.”\n\nDavid Weiss, the U.S. attorney for Delaware, later confirmed the investigation but has declined to share any details.\n\nA grand jury subpoena showed that prosecutors compelled banks to share financial records of Hunter Biden and the president’s brother, James Biden. Additionally, the mother of one of Hunter Biden’s children has said she testified to authorities pursuant to a subpoena.\n\nHagerty pressed Garland on whether a special counsel is appropriate, considering the public comments by Klain and White House communications director Kate Bedingfield.\n\n“There’s an obvious conflict of interest here. Because those who are investigating the Biden family and their enterprise can be fired by the head of the family who is being investigated,” Hagerty said.\n\nGarland declined to say whether the department has or is considering appointing a special counsel, though he noted that special counsels are also employees of the Department of Justice.\n\nHe also would not answer when asked if he agreed with the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller, who was tasked with investigating allegations of collusion between Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia.\n\n“The question of whether to have a special counsel is one that is internal decision-making in the department, so I don’t want to make any judgments one way or the other,” Garland told Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) later in the hearing. “I’m quite comfortable with the United States attorney for that district continuing in the role that he’s playing.”', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/26/garland-before-senate-1200x800.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:30'}

Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) and Mike Braun (R-Ind.) at an April 26 Senate Committee on Appropriations hearing.\n\n“As I said during my nomination hearing, the investigation is being run by and supervised by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware. He [David Weiss] is supervising the investigation, and I’m not at liberty to talk about internal DOJ deliberations—but he is in charge of that investigation, and there will not be interference of any political or improper kind,” Garland said, also declining to comment on whether other senior DOJ officials have been briefed.\n\nHagerty expressed skepticism at Garland’s promise, given recent statements from the White House regarding Hunter Biden’s innocence.\n\n“I wonder why the president is resorting to go to TV and … his surrogates. Earlier this month, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain said on TV that the president is confident that his son didn’t break the law, and the White House communications director said President Biden maintains his position that his son did nothing that was unethical,” Hagerty said.\n\nThe senator asked Garland whether U.S. President Joe Biden had told him his son is innocent.\n\n“Absolutely not,” Garland responded. “He has not done that, and he has committed to not interfere in the investigation.”\n\nHagerty pressed further, asking Garland how the public could be confident there won’t be political interference in the investigation.\n\n“Because we put a Trump appointee in charge of the investigation,” Garland said, referring to Weiss. “And because you have me as attorney general, who’s committed to the independence of the DOJ from any influence from the White House.”\n\nHagerty then asked Garland whether the DOJ was considering assigning a special counsel to investigate Hunter Biden. Garland again declined to comment.\n\nWhen asked under what circumstances a special counsel would be used in the investigation, Garland said, “it depends on the circumstances.”\n\nBraun asked similar questions about a potential special counsel and received similar responses.\n\n“The question is an internal DOJ matter,” Garland repeated. “I don’t want to make judgments, but I’m comfortable with the Attorney from Delaware continuing.”\n\nThe federal investigation into Hunter Biden’s finances was revealed in December 2020, and few updates have been provided since then.\n\nAttorney Clint Lancaster, who represented an Arkansas woman who filed the lawsuit in 2019 alleging that Hunter Biden was the father of her daughter Navy Joan Roberts, told CBS News earlier this month that federal prosecutors subpoenaed the documents from his case.\n\n“They wanted every record relating to Hunter Biden we had,” he said of the paternity case, which was settled in 2020.\n\nLancaster said the records included Hunter Biden’s “affidavit of financial means” during the paternity lawsuit. A financial affidavit is generally a statement showing income, expenses, assets, and liabilities.\n\nAdditionally, he said the tax records he and Roberts provided overlapped during the same time period as Hunter Biden’s foreign business activities.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/1.tagreuters.com2022binary_LYNXNPEI3510J-FILEDIMAGE-1200x833.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:47'}

Bill Hagerty (R-TN) asked Garland if he knew of the probe into the president’s son. Garland refused to reveal any internal deliberations against Hunter but noted the investigation is being run by David Weiss, a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nWeiss, a 20-year federal prosecutor, will have to determine if there is enough evidence to seek a federal grand jury indictment against Hunter Biden in an investigation that may end up including other members of the Biden family, such as Joe Biden’s brother James Biden, and potentially the president himself.\n\n“I’m aware of that, but he reports to you,” Hagerty pressed about the investigation under Weiss.\n\n“He is supervising the investigation and I’m not at liberty to talk about internal Justice Department deliberations, but he is in charge of that investigation,” Garland reiterated.\n\nGarland then promised the Biden administration would not interfere in the investigation. “There will not be interference of any political or improper kind.”\n\nHagerty continued his line of questioning by asking if Joe Biden ever told Garland that Hunter did not break any laws, including tax fraud, money laundering, and violation of lobbying laws.\n\n“Absolutely not. And the President has not done that. And the President is committed not to interfere, not only in that investigation but any other kind of investigation,” Garland claimed.\n\nLater in the hearing, Garland refused to say whether a special counsel should be placed over the investigation to maintain a just investigation. A special counsel would provide a degree of separation between Biden’s administration and the investigation. Legal experts have said a special counsel is necessary because Joe Biden has denied any wrongdoing by Hunter and may have influenced the ongoing investigation.\n\n“The question of whether they have a special counsel is one that is an internal decision-making within the department, so I don’t want to make any judgments one way or the other,” Garland responded. “But I’m quite comfortable with the United States attorney for that district continuing in the role that he’s [Weiss] playing.”\n\nDuring the 2020 presidential debate, Joe Biden claimed Hunter’s “laptop from hell” was a Russian plant “and a smear campaign.” Joe Biden has repeatedly claimed he was never involved in the family business.\n\nJoe Biden said the emails on Hunter’s laptop were a “Russian plant” and “a smear campaign.” Today new emails indicate that Biden was PAYING Hunter’s bills for a deal with a Chinese government-controlled entity. pic.twitter.com/K3Ojf3SyIg — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) April 26, 2022\n\nBut according to White House visitor logs obtained by the New York Post on Saturday, Hunter’s corrupt business partner, Eric Schwerin, met with Joe Biden at the White House 19 times between 2009 and 2015. Joe Biden was vice president during this time. The contact between Joe Biden and Schwerin directly contradicts Joe Biden’s repeated claims he was never involved in the family business. The Post’s reporting adds a twelfth instance Joe Biden has been involved in the family’s business scheme.\n\nDOOCY: "The President has said that he never spoke to his son about his overseas business dealings.

Sixty percent say Hunter Biden has sold “influence and access” to Joe Biden. The poll also shows 67 percent believe Joe Biden should be impeached if he “secretly participated and facilitated” in the family’s business.\n\nText messages from 2019 on Hunter’s “laptop from hell” depict the Biden family payout mechanism.

But don’t worry, unlike Pop [Joe], I won’t make you give me half your salary.”\n\nThe Biden’s family payment mechanism of collecting 50 percent of family salaries for 30 years could be legal “predicates” for racketeering charges, according to former Utah U.S. attorney Brett Tolman.\n\nFollow Wendell Husebø on Twitter and Gettr @WendellHusebø.

A Trump-appointed federal judge in Louisiana said he planned to block the administration’s plans for rescinding the public health order, a win for a group of GOP-led states who sued to stop Biden from moving forward.\n\nThe meeting punctuated internal disagreement in the Democratic Party around the Biden administration’s decision to end enforcement of the Title 42 authority, a public health order that allows border officials to speedily turn away migrants at the U.S. southern border.\n\nImmigration advocates have a litany of concerns about the policy, but at the center of those issues is that it allows officials to forego asylum screenings, blocking persecuted migrants from exercising a right they have under U.S. law.\n\nWhile many support the Biden administration’s decision and indeed wish it had come sooner, others have expressed concern about the plans amid a prolonged spike in border crossings.\n\n“Yes they’re listening to the immigration activists, but my question is who’s listening to the men and women in green and in blue and, more importantly, who is listening to the border communities – the sheriffs, the landowners, the rest of the people who live on the border?” Rep.

Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.), who was tasked with presenting the group’s position on Title 42 to Biden, said the meeting touched on a series of issues before turning to immigration, an issue that still led coverage of the meeting.\n\n“The reality is when you talk to Latinos they’re talking about the economy, jobs, air pollution, and so the media is talking about things that are divisive,” said Barragán.\n\nBarragán added that the CHC puts more blame over the immigration policy crisis on former President Trump than on Biden.\n\n“The bottom line is this president walked into a tough situation with a prior administration who dismantled the legal immigration system,” she said.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the meeting was part of Biden’s outreach to individual congressional caucuses. Biden has recently met with the Congressional Progressive Caucus as well as other groups in Congress.\n\nAttendees said that it also covered the implementation of the bipartisan infrastructure law, immigration reform, and environmental justice.\n\nAt one point, an aide to the president walked into the room with a note saying the 30-minute meeting had gone on for 62 minutes.\n\nBiden, rather than keep the information to himself, read the note out loud to laughter from the attendees.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House is facing pressure from immigration advocates to forcefully oppose a bill that has attracted support from moderate senators that would delay an end to the enforcement of Title 42. The White House has not taken a position on the legislation.\n\n“I just wish that the Biden administration would stand up and explain what it’s doing and own it,” said Clara Long, associate director at Human Rights Watch who focuses on immigration and border policy.\n\nPsaki again on Monday said it would be up to Congress to make any changes to CDC’s Title 42 enforcement, but she declined to say whether Biden would sign legislation that did so.\n\n“This would be Congress having the discussion. We are continuing to prepare for a May 23 implementation,” Psaki said. “There will be a range of conversations about this over the coming days.”\n\nThe lawsuits filed by GOP-led states seem to be the biggest immediate threat to the administration’s plans. Some have speculated that the White House would like to see the courts thwart their plans in order to take a hot-button political issue off Biden’s plate.\n\n“I think there’s a theory going around that they’re hoping the courts give them a get-out-of-jail-free card,” said Long.\n\nBiden’s approval ratings are particularly low on his handling of immigration.\n\nA Politico/Morning Consult poll conducted earlier this month found that 54 percent of registered voters oppose Biden’s decision to lift Title 42.\n\nBut a different poll conducted in February by Impact Research for the National Immigration Law Center found that 52 percent of likely 2022 voters support ending Title 42 enforcement.\n\nStill, most CHC members believe that the administration can push forward with its vision of border policy, because Republicans are unlikely to relent from attacking Biden on immigration and the border.\n\n“No matter what the president does, they’re going to make noise. The president and the Democratic-controlled Congress have done amazing things, that’s why econ has improved,” said Rep. Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.), who attended the meeting.\n\n“Republicans don’t want to focus on the glass that’s half full, they want to convince us the glass is half empty,” he added.\n\nSome advocates for ending the policy, which they say represented one prong of the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant agenda, argue that Democrats are risking turning off their base by voicing support for continuing the policy.\n\n“This is a policy that can help you win and the flipside of that is embracing the Republican talking points is not going to help you win those Democratic voters that you desperately need to turn out for you in November,” said Bri Gillis, political director of the National Immigration Law Center’s Immigrant Justice Fund.\n\nStill, some Democrats say the discussion of Title 42 is moot.\n\n“There’s nothing to debate, you’re either for Title 42 or you’re not,” said Rep. Lou Correa (D-Calif.), a CHC member who did not attend the meeting.\n\n“Everybody’s talking abt Title 42 when that’s not the issue. The real issue is American industrial might, nearshoring of American jobs from China, creating a stronger manufacturing base, and a lot of that relies on immigrants. And we’re talking about Title 42. Doesn’t even come close to addressing the bigger public policy issues in this country and that’s what everybody’s talking about. And it’s hurting us,” said Correa.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/ruizraul_031821gn_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:41'}

So remember to get your booster!” Murphy tweeted.\n\nSimmons, Harris’ communications director, tested positive for the virus after attending the April 2 Gridiron dinner, a traditional white-tie gathering of reporters and politicians that features light roasts and songs.\n\nAtty. Gen. Merrick Garland and Gina Raimondo, the secretary of Commerce, announced positive test results following the dinner, as did Reps. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank) and Joaquin Castro (D-Texas).\n\nAll of them had been vaccinated, and none became seriously ill.\n\nHarris’ positive tests come as the administration has tried to push the country toward normalcy, eliminating mask requirements in many settings and returning to public gatherings. A federal judge in Florida took it a step further last week, overturning a federal requirement to wear masks on airplanes, trains and buses.

Here, she and Trey Hollingsworth, R-Ind., talk before a House Financial Services Committee hearing in 2018\n\nSinema asked Biden's aides not to send the president to her home state for a 'victory lap' after Biden signed the infrastructure bill, according to the book\n\nTrump's belief that he could prevail extended well after the time he left the White House and decamped to Mar-a-Lago.\n\nAnd it wasn't just Donald Trump's most passionate adherents who believed in the 'reinstatement' myth – the former President himself was saying last spring he would be reinstalled within months, the book reveals.\n\nTrump stated his belief in the theory in May of 2021, four months after leaving office, according to the book.\n\nThe idea of a Trump reinstatement was being promoted at the time by My Pillow exec Mike Lindell and QAnon adherents, although it would ultimately be believed by nearly a third of Republicans in a June Politico / Morning Consult survey.\n\nTrump phoned National Review editor Rich Lowry to tell him that the magazine 'would take off like a rocket if it recognized that he had actually won the election,' according to the book.\n\n'In fact, Trump told Lowry, he expected to be reinstated by August, and Republicans would be put back in charge of the Senate once the supposedly pervasive corruption of the 2020 election was exposed.'\n\nFormer President Donald Trump told columnist Rich Lowry in May 2021 he expected to be reinstated within months, according to a new book\n\nThe Senate had flipped to Democratic control in 2000 after two Democratic wins in Georgia.\n\nThere is no provision in the Constitution for 'reinstatement' once election results have been certified by the states and Congress has counted the electoral votes and the president and lawmakers have been sworn into office.\n\n(Lowry may have been an odd target for Trump's lobbying. He had called the Capitol riot in a Jan. 6th column a 'disgrace,' where he wrote that 'one point of the riot was to further pressure Pence (“Hang Mike Pence!”), but much of the lobbying took place behind closed doors, among Trump’s advisers.')\n\nTrump also took a shot at now Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. 'It was beyond belief, Trump said, that Mitch McConnell did not seem to understand this,' according to the book.\n\n'The president's comments were pure madness,' the authors write.\n\nCongress ultimately counted the votes certified by the states following the Capitol riot. Joe Biden took the oath Jan. 20th after Trump left the White House\n\nTrump has been spending time at Mar-a-Lago and holding rallies around the country while dangling the possibility of a return to the White House\n\nThere have been multiple reports on Trump's interest in getting 'reinstated.'\n\nAfter Trump withdrew his endorsement of Alabama GOP Rep. Mo Brooks, Brooks released a statement saying Trump had approached him with the idea.\n\n'President Trump asked me to rescind the 2020 elections, immediately remove Joe Biden from the White House, immediately put President Trump back in the White House, and hold a new special election for the presidency,' Brooks said in a statement.\n\n'As a lawyer, I’ve repeatedly advised President Trump that January 6 was the final election contest verdict and neither the U.S. Constitution nor the U.S. Code permit what President Trump asks. Period,' he added.\n\n'I’ve told President Trump the truth knowing full well that it might cause President Trump to rescind his endorsement. But I took a sworn oath to defend and protect the U.S. Constitution. I honor my oath. That is the way I am. I break my sworn oath for no man.'\n\nTrump took back his endorsement in the Alabama Senate primary, citing Brooks' call for people to put the 2020 election 'behind you.'\n\nLindell, who was advised Trump inside the White House in the last days of his presidency, has also repeatedly touted the idea.\n\nOther passages in the book reveal how Vice President Kamala Harris quickly learned not to come between President Biden and his negotiations with Congress.\n\nThe authors recount one episode where the president snapped at her so harshly even Republican senators in the meeting were shocked.\n\nIn a meeting last May, Biden tried to persuade Republican lawmakers to support $1 trillion in infrastructure spending.\n\nAnd while Biden was ready for a compromise, Harris thought the bill was skimpy.\n\n'Harris thought that there was something missing from the conversation,' according to the book.\n\nShe began turning the conversation toward Democratic priorities, including family and social spending, which were originally included in the larger Build Back Better bill.\n\nShe 'began to make the case for a larger package than the one Republicans seemed to have in mind.'\n\n'Biden dismissed her comment immediately,' the authors wrote, in so harsh a tone 'that even the Republican senators were taken aback.'\n\nBiden was typically 'scrupulously respectful' of his second-in-command, but the moment revealed that infrastructure negotiations were his and his alone.", 'image': 'https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/26/17/57074033-0-image-a-35_1650989503049.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:57:00'}

After months in short supply, federal officials say the medications are now more widely available, yet are being underused.\n\nAs part of the new effort, the federal government plans to allow thousands of more pharmacies to directly order highly effective COVID-19 treatments like Pfizer\'s Paxlovid antiviral pills, which can reduce the risk of becoming severely ill. They also plan to launch additional "test-to-treat" sites, where Americans can get diagnosed and receive the pills in a single visit.\n\nPaxlovid was first authorized by the Food and Drug Administration in December, and supplies were hard to come by at first. Now the pills are no longer scarce, but they still aren\'t getting to everyone who might benefit from treatment.\n\n"It\'s pretty clear from the uptake of Paxlovid, and the rate of hospitalizations and deaths over the months that Paxlovid has been available, that there are still some folks who could have benefited from these medications," an administration official told reporters on Monday in a briefing to preview the announcement.\n\nFederal officials have voiced concerns publicly for weeks that treatments like Paxlovid, Merck and Ridgeback\'s Lagevrio antiviral pills, and Eli Lilly\'s bebtelovimab monoclonal antibody drug were not reaching enough Americans.\n\nOfficials said Monday that reported use of the antiviral pills has more than doubled over the past month, from 22,000 courses a week to over 55,000. That comes as cases and hospitalizations have begun to climb nationwide, driven by the highly-contagious Omicron BA.2 subvariant.\n\nIn New England, federal data has tracked the pace of new COVID-19 hospitalizations surging among patients 70 and older — the age group most vulnerable to severe COVID-19 — since the beginning of April. The rate of new admissions is now higher than the peak reached over the Delta variant wave last year, but remains a fraction of the record highs during the winter Omicron wave.\n\n"We certainly know that there\'s more room to go. We can save more lives by giving this medication to more people," said the official.\n\nGetting Paxlovid antiviral pills\n\nPaxlovid treatment needs to begin within a few days of first developing symptoms.\n\nA course of treatment is made up of three tablets that are taken twice a day, in the morning and evening, over the course of five days, for a total of 30 pills. Initial clinical trials showed the drug reduced the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization or death by 88%, compared to placebo.\n\nPaxlovid cannot be taken at the same time as several medications that can reduce the drug\'s efficacy or lead to potentially fatal side effects.\n\nThrough outreach to doctors and patients, officials say they hope more eligible Americans will act quickly to get the now-plentiful antiviral pills sitting on pharmacy shelves.\n\nPfizer\'s COVID-19 drug Paxlovid Fabian Sommer/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\n"A lot of providers early on in that scarcity mindset, when there were fewer courses available across the country, were really reserving this for only the folks who they thought would be the sickest of the sick," an administration official told reporters.\n\nOn Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health alert urging doctors to step up prescribing of effective COVID-19 treatments — and imploring at-risk patients who test positive not to delay in contacting their doctors, "even if your symptoms are mild."\n\nA "tranche" of more than 100,000 courses of the antiviral pills will be made available to all of the federal government\'s pharmacy partners to order directly, instead of through federal and local allocations. Officials say they expect the move will raise the number of sites with drugs in stock from 20,000 to 30,000.\n\nThat comes on top of efforts like the administration\'s nationwide "test-to-treat initiative" launched at thousands of pharmacies earlier this year.\n\nFollowing concerns that the program was inaccessible to Americans living in many parts of the country, officials said the administration is planning to launch new "federally-supported Test-to-Treat sites" beyond the 2,200 locations currently in the program.\n\n"I think we\'re going to be working really closely with these new federally supported sites, work directly with state, territorial, and jurisdictional leadership to identify the places that need more support," said an administration official.\n\nChallenges and questions\n\nOfficials acknowledged that the new moves do not address some of the criticisms levied against the Biden administration\'s treatment effort.\n\nDespite objections from pharmacy trade groups, the FDA excludes most pharmacists from being able to prescribe Paxlovid or Lagevrio. For at-risk Americans without access to a "test-to-treat" drugstore that has a qualifying provider available, this means some will have to make multiple trips to get the pills.\n\n"You have to develop COVID symptoms, you have to subsequently get a test for COVID-19, get the result of that test, find and go to see a provider, get a prescription, and then fill that prescription. That\'s six steps in five days," said an official.\n\nIt also does not include an expansion to who is eligible to take the drugs under the FDA\'s emergency use authorization.\n\nSpeaking at Uniformed Services University earlier this month, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the president\'s chief medical adviser, hinted that Paxlovid might soon be expanded to lower-risk patients "in order to prevent them possibly from getting long COVID."\n\nBoth Pfizer and Merck have also been running a range of trials that might support expanding use of the antiviral pills to more people. Results could come soon from a trial assessing Paxlovid in people who are exposed to the disease, but have not yet developed symptoms, which was due to be completed earlier this month.\n\nAnd administration officials at the briefing did not bring up growing reports of "rebound" or "relapse" symptoms — people who appear to recover from COVID-19 after taking the antiviral pills, but later get a new round of symptoms — which might lead to SARS-CoV-2 evolving resistance to the treatments.\n\nA spokesperson for Pfizer said the company was continuing to monitor data from their clinical trials of Paxlovid as well as real-world evidence, and has "not seen any resistance" to the drug.\n\nIn a statement, an FDA spokesperson acknowledged that reports of rebound "are important to evaluate further," but reiterated that the drug appeared 88% effective at reducing the risk of hospitalization or death in its clinical trial.\n\n"The FDA is evaluating the reports of viral load rebound after completing Paxlovid treatment and will share recommendations if appropriate," said the FDA\'s Chanapa Tantibanchachai.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/04/26/75834f94-0c35-4873-8166-5e4b24cfa0d3/thumbnail/1200x630/5625e6265f72e4689718b2845b0511c4/gettyimages-1238865166.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:22'}

It’s “the poster child for an unfair system.”\n\nDespite the administration’s attempt to reassure providers that there are enough pills for patients, in an interview with NPR on Monday, the White House’s Covid-19 response coordinator, Dr Ashish Jha, said that there are only enough pills “for the short run.” As of Tuesday, the US had ordered enough supply of the pills for 20 million people, which is estimated to last for several more months.\n\n“Right now, we’ve done a really good job of acquiring pills,” Jha said, adding that the Biden administration will need additional funding from Congress to acquire more pills. “We have to make sure that this is more than a short-term solution.”\n\nJha warned that the US will be running out of money for Paxlovid “reasonably soon,” and that “we actually aren’t even going to be able to pay our bills for what we’ve already entered into a contract with Pfizer for, so that’s going to be a problem.”\n\nThe Biden administration is expected to renew its request to Congress for $22bn in Covid-19 funding.\n\nPaxlovid, when administered within five days of symptoms appearing, has been proven to bring about a 90% reduction in hospitalizations and deaths among patients most likely to get severe disease. About 350 Americans are now dying each day from Covid-19, down from more than 2,600 during the height of the Omicron wave earlier this year.\n\nThe FDA authorized Pfizer’s drug for emergency use in adults and children age 12 or older with a positive Covid-19 test and early symptoms who face the highest risk of severe outcomes. That includes older people and those with conditions like obesity and heart disease, though the drug is not recommended for patients with severe kidney or liver problems.\n\nThe administration is also working to expand the number of “test-to-treat” sites that provide a one-stop shop for those with Covid-19 to get tested for the virus, consult with a medical professional if they’re positive and fill a prescription for Paxlovid on site.\n\nThere are now 2,200 such locations nationwide, though the administration hopes more sites come online in the next several weeks with support from the Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and pharmacy companies.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ec9f8e72eff2d14c7cbb28bd8af41604fea72e5/0_301_5075_3047/master/5075.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=269eeb032fb24072e4c2185b17d3cc66', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:54'}

Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) questioned Garland on the matter, pointing out that Joe Biden’s messengers, including White House chief of staff Ronald Klain, have said on national television that the president is confident his son, Hunter Biden, did nothing wrong.\n\n“The president’s already told his subordinates—clearly, these are people he can fire at will—that he and his family did nothing wrong. How can the American people be confident that his administration is conducting a serious investigation?” Hagerty asked.\n\n“Because we put the investigation in the hands of a Trump appointee, from the previous administration, who’s the United States attorney for the District of Delaware, and because you have me as the attorney general, who is committed to the independence of the Justice Department from any influence from the White House in criminal matters,” Garland, a Biden appointee, responded.\n\nThe probe was first revealed by Hunter Biden in late 2020. He claimed that prosecutors were investigating his “tax affairs.”\n\nDavid Weiss, the U.S. attorney for Delaware, later confirmed the investigation but has declined to share any details.\n\nA grand jury subpoena showed that prosecutors compelled banks to share financial records of Hunter Biden and the president’s brother, James Biden. Additionally, the mother of one of Hunter Biden’s children has said she testified to authorities pursuant to a subpoena.\n\nHagerty pressed Garland on whether a special counsel is appropriate, considering the public comments by Klain and White House communications director Kate Bedingfield.\n\n“There’s an obvious conflict of interest here. Because those who are investigating the Biden family and their enterprise can be fired by the head of the family who is being investigated,” Hagerty said.\n\nGarland declined to say whether the department has or is considering appointing a special counsel, though he noted that special counsels are also employees of the Department of Justice.\n\nHe also would not answer when asked if he agreed with the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller, who was tasked with investigating allegations of collusion between Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia.\n\n“The question of whether to have a special counsel is one that is internal decision-making in the department, so I don’t want to make any judgments one way or the other,” Garland told Sen.

Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) and Mike Braun (R-Ind.) at an April 26 Senate Committee on Appropriations hearing.\n\n“As I said during my nomination hearing, the investigation is being run by and supervised by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware. He [David Weiss] is supervising the investigation, and I’m not at liberty to talk about internal DOJ deliberations—but he is in charge of that investigation, and there will not be interference of any political or improper kind,” Garland said, also declining to comment on whether other senior DOJ officials have been briefed.\n\nHagerty expressed skepticism at Garland’s promise, given recent statements from the White House regarding Hunter Biden’s innocence.\n\n“I wonder why the president is resorting to go to TV and … his surrogates. Earlier this month, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain said on TV that the president is confident that his son didn’t break the law, and the White House communications director said President Biden maintains his position that his son did nothing that was unethical,” Hagerty said.\n\nThe senator asked Garland whether U.S. President Joe Biden had told him his son is innocent.\n\n“Absolutely not,” Garland responded. “He has not done that, and he has committed to not interfere in the investigation.”\n\nHagerty pressed further, asking Garland how the public could be confident there won’t be political interference in the investigation.\n\n“Because we put a Trump appointee in charge of the investigation,” Garland said, referring to Weiss. “And because you have me as attorney general, who’s committed to the independence of the DOJ from any influence from the White House.”\n\nHagerty then asked Garland whether the DOJ was considering assigning a special counsel to investigate Hunter Biden. Garland again declined to comment.\n\nWhen asked under what circumstances a special counsel would be used in the investigation, Garland said, “it depends on the circumstances.”\n\nBraun asked similar questions about a potential special counsel and received similar responses.\n\n“The question is an internal DOJ matter,” Garland repeated. “I don’t want to make judgments, but I’m comfortable with the Attorney from Delaware continuing.”\n\nThe federal investigation into Hunter Biden’s finances was revealed in December 2020, and few updates have been provided since then.\n\nAttorney Clint Lancaster, who represented an Arkansas woman who filed the lawsuit in 2019 alleging that Hunter Biden was the father of her daughter Navy Joan Roberts, told CBS News earlier this month that federal prosecutors subpoenaed the documents from his case.\n\n“They wanted every record relating to Hunter Biden we had,” he said of the paternity case, which was settled in 2020.\n\nLancaster said the records included Hunter Biden’s “affidavit of financial means” during the paternity lawsuit. A financial affidavit is generally a statement showing income, expenses, assets, and liabilities.\n\nAdditionally, he said the tax records he and Roberts provided overlapped during the same time period as Hunter Biden’s foreign business activities.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/1.tagreuters.com2022binary_LYNXNPEI3510J-FILEDIMAGE-1200x833.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:47'}

Bill Hagerty (R-TN) asked Garland if he knew of the probe into the president’s son. Garland refused to reveal any internal deliberations against Hunter but noted the investigation is being run by David Weiss, a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nWeiss, a 20-year federal prosecutor, will have to determine if there is enough evidence to seek a federal grand jury indictment against Hunter Biden in an investigation that may end up including other members of the Biden family, such as Joe Biden’s brother James Biden, and potentially the president himself.\n\n“I’m aware of that, but he reports to you,” Hagerty pressed about the investigation under Weiss.\n\n“He is supervising the investigation and I’m not at liberty to talk about internal Justice Department deliberations, but he is in charge of that investigation,” Garland reiterated.\n\nGarland then promised the Biden administration would not interfere in the investigation. “There will not be interference of any political or improper kind.”\n\nHagerty continued his line of questioning by asking if Joe Biden ever told Garland that Hunter did not break any laws, including tax fraud, money laundering, and violation of lobbying laws.\n\n“Absolutely not. And the President has not done that. And the President is committed not to interfere, not only in that investigation but any other kind of investigation,” Garland claimed.\n\nLater in the hearing, Garland refused to say whether a special counsel should be placed over the investigation to maintain a just investigation. A special counsel would provide a degree of separation between Biden’s administration and the investigation. Legal experts have said a special counsel is necessary because Joe Biden has denied any wrongdoing by Hunter and may have influenced the ongoing investigation.\n\n“The question of whether they have a special counsel is one that is an internal decision-making within the department, so I don’t want to make any judgments one way or the other,” Garland responded. “But I’m quite comfortable with the United States attorney for that district continuing in the role that he’s [Weiss] playing.”\n\nDuring the 2020 presidential debate, Joe Biden claimed Hunter’s “laptop from hell” was a Russian plant “and a smear campaign.” Joe Biden has repeatedly claimed he was never involved in the family business.\n\nJoe Biden said the emails on Hunter’s laptop were a “Russian plant” and “a smear campaign.” Today new emails indicate that Biden was PAYING Hunter’s bills for a deal with a Chinese government-controlled entity. pic.twitter.com/K3Ojf3SyIg — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) April 26, 2022\n\nBut according to White House visitor logs obtained by the New York Post on Saturday, Hunter’s corrupt business partner, Eric Schwerin, met with Joe Biden at the White House 19 times between 2009 and 2015. Joe Biden was vice president during this time. The contact between Joe Biden and Schwerin directly contradicts Joe Biden’s repeated claims he was never involved in the family business. The Post’s reporting adds a twelfth instance Joe Biden has been involved in the family’s business scheme.\n\nDOOCY: "The President has said that he never spoke to his son about his overseas business dealings.

Sixty percent say Hunter Biden has sold “influence and access” to Joe Biden. The poll also shows 67 percent believe Joe Biden should be impeached if he “secretly participated and facilitated” in the family’s business.\n\nText messages from 2019 on Hunter’s “laptop from hell” depict the Biden family payout mechanism. The instrument indicates a collection of 50 percent of familial salaries for 30 years.\n\n“I hope you all can do what I did and pay for everything for this entire family for 30 years,” Hunter texted to his daughter in 2019. “It’s really hard. But don’t worry, unlike Pop [Joe], I won’t make you give me half your salary.”\n\nThe Biden’s family payment mechanism of collecting 50 percent of family salaries for 30 years could be legal “predicates” for racketeering charges, according to former Utah U.S. attorney Brett Tolman.\n\nFollow Wendell Husebø on Twitter and Gettr @WendellHusebø.

She returned to Washington on Monday.\n\nHarris “will isolate and continue to work from the Vice President’s residence,” Kirsten Allen, her spokesperson, said in a statement. “The Vice President will return to the White House when she tests negative.”\n\nHarris had avoided catching the virus for months, despite close contacts testing positive. Jamal Simmons, her communications director, announced a positive result earlier this month; Harris’ husband, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, contracted the virus in March.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe vice president’s positive tests could create governing concerns given that Harris is the first in line of presidential succession to Biden, 79. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), second in line, announced a positive test earlier this month.\n\nHarris, 57, has been vaccinated and boosted twice. The shots greatly diminish the chances of her becoming seriously ill. When former President Trump, 75, was hospitalized with COVID-19 in October 2020, he was at much higher risk, given his age and the lack of available vaccines. Trump has said he has since been vaccinated and boosted.\n\nWhite House officials have said that they expect Biden will catch the virus, but he has not been avoiding events with crowds. He is scheduled to attend the White House Correspondents Assn. dinner Saturday and to speak at a memorial service Sunday for former Vice President Walter Mondale in Minneapolis.\n\n“Like many Americans, he makes risk assessments,” Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.\n\nHarris had initially planned to return to Washington from California, where she took some personal time and gave a speech about anti-satellite missiles and another about maternal health, on Tuesday. Her office would not say why she altered her travel plans to return a day earlier but noted that she was not experiencing any symptoms before testing positive.\n\nBecause she had not been expected in Washington until Tuesday, Harris had a light schedule, with no meetings in the morning and no public events all day, said Allen, the spokeswoman.\n\nHarris took a rapid antigen test Tuesday morning after going to work at the White House, Allen said. After that test came back positive, Allen said, Harris took a PCR test, a more accurate assessment that confirmed the rapid result. Harris left the White House for her residence at the U.S. Naval Observatory by motorcade.\n\nBiden and Harris later spoke by phone. “He wanted to check in and make sure she has everything she needs as she quarantines at home,” the White House said in a statement.\n\nThough Harris did not attend any formal meetings, the White House is still tracing her contacts to determine who may have been exposed to her. Even when they are not in formal meetings, vice presidents interact with an array of policy, communications and personal staff.\n\n“Should we identify a close a close contact, we will notify them as appropriate,” Allen said.\n\nHer office is also going through her schedule to see which public events and private meetings need to be canceled or shifted to a virtual setting.\n\nHarris plans to work from her residence for at least five days and will not return to the White House until she receives a negative test. Allen declined to say whether Harris would be taking any medication, adding that such decisions would be left to White House physicians.\n\nThe latest wave of COVID, sparked by the Omicron BA. 2 subvariants, has swept through official Washington in recent weeks, infecting many members of Congress and the executive branch. The White House rhetoric has shifted from preventing infections to promoting vaccines, boosters and therapeutics.\n\n“It is going to be hard to ensure that no one gets COVID in America,” Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House’s coronavirus coordinator, told reporters Tuesday. “That’s not even a policy. The goal of our policy should be obviously to minimize infections whenever possible, but to make sure people don’t get seriously ill. The best ways of doing that are make sure people are vaccinated and boosted as the vice president is and making sure we have plenty of therapeutics.”\n\nMinutes after Harris announced her result, two Democratic members of the Senate — Ron Wyden of Oregon and Chris Murphy of Connecticut — announced they too had contracted what they believed to be mild forms of the virus.\n\n“It’s a bummer, but I’m sure if I wasn’t fully vaccinated I would be feeling a lot worse. So remember to get your booster!” Murphy tweeted.\n\nSimmons, Harris’ communications director, tested positive for the virus after attending the April 2 Gridiron dinner, a traditional white-tie gathering of reporters and politicians that features light roasts and songs.\n\nAtty. Gen. Merrick Garland and Gina Raimondo, the secretary of Commerce, announced positive test results following the dinner, as did Reps. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank) and Joaquin Castro (D-Texas).\n\nAll of them had been vaccinated, and none became seriously ill.\n\nHarris’ positive tests come as the administration has tried to push the country toward normalcy, eliminating mask requirements in many settings and returning to public gatherings. A federal judge in Florida took it a step further last week, overturning a federal requirement to wear masks on airplanes, trains and buses. The administration is appealing that ruling.\n\n“None of us can predict with any certainty where exactly this pandemic is going, what the virus is going to do next. All we can do is prepare,” Jha said, urging Congress to pass another round of funding to combat the virus.\n\nStaff writer Eli Stokols contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n', 'image': 'https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ab3b3ac/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffb%2Fff%2Fcfc38a794c329c2a8d3684ababb9%2F947026-na-pol-0421-vp-cali-trip-kkn-25884.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:57'}

She continued to test negative during Emhoff’s stint with the coronavirus.\n\nTwo Democratic senators also tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday: Chris Murphy (Conn.) and Ron Wyden (Ore.).\n\nEarlier this month, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) had the coronavirus, as did Attorney General Merrick Garland.\n\nThe White House recently first acknowledged that Biden could get COVID-19 amid the uptick in positive cases surrounding the president earlier this month.\n\n“I wouldn’t say it’s just a matter of time, but I of course it is possible that the president, like every other American, could get COVID,” Jha said on Tuesday. “There is no 100 percent anything.”\n\nPsaki was asked to respond to a hypothetical question about the line of succession if Biden were to also get COVID-19 and both he and Harris become “very ill.”\n\n“Well, technically the Speaker of the House is the third in line. So, there you go. No, I’m just confirming that for you. It is true, as we’ve noted many times, it is possible the president could test positive. We will be very transparent with you if that were to happen,” Psaki said.\n\nShe added though that she thinks Biden would be able to continue his presidential duties if he were to test positive.\n\n“He has access to the best health care in the world, and we believe, because of all the precautions and steps we have taken that he would be able to continue his duties, as the vice president is as well as vice president,” she said.\n\nOfficials stress that he is vaccinated, and Psaki said last week last week that it wouldn’t be a failure of the precautions in place to protect Biden if he were to get the virus.\n\nPsaki on Tuesday told reporters not to expect updates to protocols, including masking protocols, within the White House in light of Harris’ positive test.\n\nShe noted there is a regular testing cadence for the president and vice president, as well as officials around them, and that there is social distancing in meetings and a number of aides choose to wear masks.\n\nUpdated at 4:09 p.m.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/harriskamala_031522_ap_manuel_balce_ceneta.jpeg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:41'}

Kyrsten Sinema has confounded Democrats over budget talks – even while boasting about using her cleavage to reel in 'uptight' Republicans, according to a new book.\n\nSinema, a weight-lifter and fitness buff, regularly draws attention in the buttoned-down Senate hallways with her eclectic fashion choices.\n\nBut she has also developed ways to contend with Republicans in the minority, according to This Will Not Pass, a new book by New York Times reporters Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns.\n\nDespite being more 'discomfiting' to the White House than any Democrat in the 50-50 Senate, Sinema had relationships across the political aisle. The former House member, who is the first bisexual member of the Senate, 'joked with Democrats about how easy it was for her to charm Republican men,' according to the book.\n\n'Sinema, a fitness enthusiast who was 36 when she entered Congress, boasted knowingly to colleagues and aides that her cleavage had an extraordinary persuasive effect on the uptight men of the GOP. She told one House Republican that while she would never switch parties, her father would be delighted if she did,' the authors write.\n\nSen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) 'boasted knowingly to colleagues and aides that her cleavage had an extraordinary persuasive effect on the uptight men of the GOP,' according to a new book\n\nThe book also delves into President Joe Biden's governing woes – including prolonged talks with Sinema, whom the authors dub an 'aloof Arizonan.' She became a progressive nemesis when she and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) wouldn't go along with Biden's multi-trillion proposals, although she did cheer his infrastructure plan.\n\nAfter Biden signed the infrastructure bill, Sinema asked Biden's aides not to send the president to her home state for a 'victory lap,' even though he had won Arizona in 2020. White House aides were concluding she was 'simply a difficult person.'\n\nThe book describes one early 2021 dinner with Senate Republicans after the election where where the Republicans asked Sinema to join – and she requested to be able to enter through a back door to avoid being seen.\n\nShe has won praise from Republicans for her opposition to changing the Senate filibuster, and a line of Republicans congratulated her on the Senate floor after voting with the GOP on a move to advance the Democratic leadership backed voting rights legislation.\n\nThe book, which grabbed headlines with revelations about House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, also contains details about former President Donald Trump and his election overturn effort.\n\nSinema confounded Democrats during months-long negotiations\n\nSinema previously served in the House.

He had called the Capitol riot in a Jan. 6th column a 'disgrace,' where he wrote that 'one point of the riot was to further pressure Pence (“Hang Mike Pence!”), but much of the lobbying took place behind closed doors, among Trump’s advisers.')\n\nTrump also took a shot at now Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. 'It was beyond belief, Trump said, that Mitch McConnell did not seem to understand this,' according to the book.\n\n'The president's comments were pure madness,' the authors write.\n\nCongress ultimately counted the votes certified by the states following the Capitol riot.

Mo Brooks, Brooks released a statement saying Trump had approached him with the idea.\n\n'President Trump asked me to rescind the 2020 elections, immediately remove Joe Biden from the White House, immediately put President Trump back in the White House, and hold a new special election for the presidency,' Brooks said in a statement.\n\n'As a lawyer, I’ve repeatedly advised President Trump that January 6 was the final election contest verdict and neither the U.S. Constitution nor the U.S. Code permit what President Trump asks. Period,' he added.\n\n'I’ve told President Trump the truth knowing full well that it might cause President Trump to rescind his endorsement. But I took a sworn oath to defend and protect the U.S. Constitution. I honor my oath. That is the way I am. I break my sworn oath for no man.'\n\nTrump took back his endorsement in the Alabama Senate primary, citing Brooks' call for people to put the 2020 election 'behind you.'\n\nLindell, who was advised Trump inside the White House in the last days of his presidency, has also repeatedly touted the idea.\n\nOther passages in the book reveal how Vice President Kamala Harris quickly learned not to come between President Biden and his negotiations with Congress.\n\nThe authors recount one episode where the president snapped at her so harshly even Republican senators in the meeting were shocked.\n\nIn a meeting last May, Biden tried to persuade Republican lawmakers to support $1 trillion in infrastructure spending.\n\nAnd while Biden was ready for a compromise, Harris thought the bill was skimpy.\n\n'Harris thought that there was something missing from the conversation,' according to the book.\n\nShe began turning the conversation toward Democratic priorities, including family and social spending, which were originally included in the larger Build Back Better bill.\n\nShe 'began to make the case for a larger package than the one Republicans seemed to have in mind.'\n\n'Biden dismissed her comment immediately,' the authors wrote, in so harsh a tone 'that even the Republican senators were taken aback.'\n\nBiden was typically 'scrupulously respectful' of his second-in-command, but the moment revealed that infrastructure negotiations were his and his alone.", 'image': 'https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/26/17/57074033-0-image-a-35_1650989503049.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:57:00'}

One email that appears to be divvying up profits for a new Chinese energy venture describes a 10 percent stake\n\nThe contents of the laptop were first reported on by the New York Post in October 2020, and was authenticated by DailyMail.com early the next year.\n\nIt contains a vast tranche of emails shedding light on Hunter's business dealings in Ukraine and China -- many while his father was vice president -- as well as lewd images of sex acts, prostitution and drug use.\n\nHowever, what Republicans hoped would be a massive roadblock in Biden's 2020 presidential campaign was quickly dismissed and ignored by most mainstream media outlets until the New York Times claimed to have authenticated it last month.\n\nThe Washington Post's subsequent report using evidence recovered from the laptop has forced a reckoning within the news media and prompted an onslaught of scrutiny for the White House over what exactly Biden knew and when.\n\nTo date, however, the president has not been implicated in any wrongdoing.", 'image': 'https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/26/18/57078605-0-image-a-3_1650995780064.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:06'}

After months in short supply, federal officials say the medications are now more widely available, yet are being underused.\n\nAs part of the new effort, the federal government plans to allow thousands of more pharmacies to directly order highly effective COVID-19 treatments like Pfizer\'s Paxlovid antiviral pills, which can reduce the risk of becoming severely ill. They also plan to launch additional "test-to-treat" sites, where Americans can get diagnosed and receive the pills in a single visit.\n\nPaxlovid was first authorized by the Food and Drug Administration in December, and supplies were hard to come by at first. Now the pills are no longer scarce, but they still aren\'t getting to everyone who might benefit from treatment.\n\n"It\'s pretty clear from the uptake of Paxlovid, and the rate of hospitalizations and deaths over the months that Paxlovid has been available, that there are still some folks who could have benefited from these medications," an administration official told reporters on Monday in a briefing to preview the announcement.\n\nFederal officials have voiced concerns publicly for weeks that treatments like Paxlovid, Merck and Ridgeback\'s Lagevrio antiviral pills, and Eli Lilly\'s bebtelovimab monoclonal antibody drug were not reaching enough Americans.\n\nOfficials said Monday that reported use of the antiviral pills has more than doubled over the past month, from 22,000 courses a week to over 55,000. That comes as cases and hospitalizations have begun to climb nationwide, driven by the highly-contagious Omicron BA.2 subvariant.\n\nIn New England, federal data has tracked the pace of new COVID-19 hospitalizations surging among patients 70 and older — the age group most vulnerable to severe COVID-19 — since the beginning of April. The rate of new admissions is now higher than the peak reached over the Delta variant wave last year, but remains a fraction of the record highs during the winter Omicron wave.\n\n"We certainly know that there\'s more room to go. We can save more lives by giving this medication to more people," said the official.\n\nGetting Paxlovid antiviral pills\n\nPaxlovid treatment needs to begin within a few days of first developing symptoms.\n\nA course of treatment is made up of three tablets that are taken twice a day, in the morning and evening, over the course of five days, for a total of 30 pills. Initial clinical trials showed the drug reduced the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization or death by 88%, compared to placebo.\n\nPaxlovid cannot be taken at the same time as several medications that can reduce the drug\'s efficacy or lead to potentially fatal side effects.\n\nThrough outreach to doctors and patients, officials say they hope more eligible Americans will act quickly to get the now-plentiful antiviral pills sitting on pharmacy shelves.\n\nPfizer\'s COVID-19 drug Paxlovid Fabian Sommer/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\n"A lot of providers early on in that scarcity mindset, when there were fewer courses available across the country, were really reserving this for only the folks who they thought would be the sickest of the sick," an administration official told reporters.\n\nOn Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health alert urging doctors to step up prescribing of effective COVID-19 treatments — and imploring at-risk patients who test positive not to delay in contacting their doctors, "even if your symptoms are mild."\n\nA "tranche" of more than 100,000 courses of the antiviral pills will be made available to all of the federal government\'s pharmacy partners to order directly, instead of through federal and local allocations. Officials say they expect the move will raise the number of sites with drugs in stock from 20,000 to 30,000.\n\nThat comes on top of efforts like the administration\'s nationwide "test-to-treat initiative" launched at thousands of pharmacies earlier this year.\n\nFollowing concerns that the program was inaccessible to Americans living in many parts of the country, officials said the administration is planning to launch new "federally-supported Test-to-Treat sites" beyond the 2,200 locations currently in the program.\n\n"I think we\'re going to be working really closely with these new federally supported sites, work directly with state, territorial, and jurisdictional leadership to identify the places that need more support," said an administration official.\n\nChallenges and questions\n\nOfficials acknowledged that the new moves do not address some of the criticisms levied against the Biden administration\'s treatment effort.\n\nDespite objections from pharmacy trade groups, the FDA excludes most pharmacists from being able to prescribe Paxlovid or Lagevrio. For at-risk Americans without access to a "test-to-treat" drugstore that has a qualifying provider available, this means some will have to make multiple trips to get the pills.\n\n"You have to develop COVID symptoms, you have to subsequently get a test for COVID-19, get the result of that test, find and go to see a provider, get a prescription, and then fill that prescription. That\'s six steps in five days," said an official.\n\nIt also does not include an expansion to who is eligible to take the drugs under the FDA\'s emergency use authorization.\n\nSpeaking at Uniformed Services University earlier this month, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the president\'s chief medical adviser, hinted that Paxlovid might soon be expanded to lower-risk patients "in order to prevent them possibly from getting long COVID."\n\nBoth Pfizer and Merck have also been running a range of trials that might support expanding use of the antiviral pills to more people. Results could come soon from a trial assessing Paxlovid in people who are exposed to the disease, but have not yet developed symptoms, which was due to be completed earlier this month.\n\nAnd administration officials at the briefing did not bring up growing reports of "rebound" or "relapse" symptoms — people who appear to recover from COVID-19 after taking the antiviral pills, but later get a new round of symptoms — which might lead to SARS-CoV-2 evolving resistance to the treatments.\n\nA spokesperson for Pfizer said the company was continuing to monitor data from their clinical trials of Paxlovid as well as real-world evidence, and has "not seen any resistance" to the drug.\n\nIn a statement, an FDA spokesperson acknowledged that reports of rebound "are important to evaluate further," but reiterated that the drug appeared 88% effective at reducing the risk of hospitalization or death in its clinical trial.\n\n"The FDA is evaluating the reports of viral load rebound after completing Paxlovid treatment and will share recommendations if appropriate," said the FDA\'s Chanapa Tantibanchachai.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/04/26/75834f94-0c35-4873-8166-5e4b24cfa0d3/thumbnail/1200x630/5625e6265f72e4689718b2845b0511c4/gettyimages-1238865166.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:22'}

Supply of the regimen was initially very limited, but as Covid-19 cases across the country have fallen and manufacturing has increased, it is now far more abundant. The White House is now moving to raise awareness of the pill and its availability, as well as making it easier to access.\n\nThe White House said Tuesday it is increasingly reaching out to doctors and announced that the drug will now be shipped directly to pharmacies, in addition to existing distribution channels run by states. That is expected to increase the number of sites from 20,000 to more than 30,000 next week and eventually to 40,000 locations.\n\nHowever, according to a senior Biden administration official speaking anonymously to Axios, many states are ordering just two-thirds of what is available to them and are using half their orders.\n\nProviders are probably limiting access to the pill because “we’ve had the experience in this pandemic before of operating in a scarcity mindset,” another administration official said in a press conference.\n\nMany states have opted for a lottery system to allocate Paxlovid and other Covid-19 drugs, often choosing to distribute the drugs to retail pharmacies instead of hospitals and clinics.\n\nAccording to Dr Douglas White, a University of Pittsburgh critical care doctor who helped design Pennsylvania’s lottery system for Covid-19 drug allocation, the system ends up favoring people who are not only aware of the drugs but have access to doctors to prescribe it and the ability to locate pharmacies that have them in stock.\n\n“The wealthy and well-connected will win the race,” White told the Los Angeles Times. It’s “the poster child for an unfair system.”\n\nDespite the administration’s attempt to reassure providers that there are enough pills for patients, in an interview with NPR on Monday, the White House’s Covid-19 response coordinator, Dr Ashish Jha, said that there are only enough pills “for the short run.” As of Tuesday, the US had ordered enough supply of the pills for 20 million people, which is estimated to last for several more months.\n\n“Right now, we’ve done a really good job of acquiring pills,” Jha said, adding that the Biden administration will need additional funding from Congress to acquire more pills. “We have to make sure that this is more than a short-term solution.”\n\nJha warned that the US will be running out of money for Paxlovid “reasonably soon,” and that “we actually aren’t even going to be able to pay our bills for what we’ve already entered into a contract with Pfizer for, so that’s going to be a problem.”\n\nThe Biden administration is expected to renew its request to Congress for $22bn in Covid-19 funding.\n\nPaxlovid, when administered within five days of symptoms appearing, has been proven to bring about a 90% reduction in hospitalizations and deaths among patients most likely to get severe disease. About 350 Americans are now dying each day from Covid-19, down from more than 2,600 during the height of the Omicron wave earlier this year.\n\nThe FDA authorized Pfizer’s drug for emergency use in adults and children age 12 or older with a positive Covid-19 test and early symptoms who face the highest risk of severe outcomes. That includes older people and those with conditions like obesity and heart disease, though the drug is not recommended for patients with severe kidney or liver problems.\n\nThe administration is also working to expand the number of “test-to-treat” sites that provide a one-stop shop for those with Covid-19 to get tested for the virus, consult with a medical professional if they’re positive and fill a prescription for Paxlovid on site.\n\nThere are now 2,200 such locations nationwide, though the administration hopes more sites come online in the next several weeks with support from the Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and pharmacy companies.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ec9f8e72eff2d14c7cbb28bd8af41604fea72e5/0_301_5075_3047/master/5075.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=269eeb032fb24072e4c2185b17d3cc66', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:54'}

Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) questioned Garland on the matter, pointing out that Joe Biden’s messengers, including White House chief of staff Ronald Klain, have said on national television that the president is confident his son, Hunter Biden, did nothing wrong.\n\n“The president’s already told his subordinates—clearly, these are people he can fire at will—that he and his family did nothing wrong. How can the American people be confident that his administration is conducting a serious investigation?” Hagerty asked.\n\n“Because we put the investigation in the hands of a Trump appointee, from the previous administration, who’s the United States attorney for the District of Delaware, and because you have me as the attorney general, who is committed to the independence of the Justice Department from any influence from the White House in criminal matters,” Garland, a Biden appointee, responded.\n\nThe probe was first revealed by Hunter Biden in late 2020. He claimed that prosecutors were investigating his “tax affairs.”\n\nDavid Weiss, the U.S. attorney for Delaware, later confirmed the investigation but has declined to share any details.\n\nA grand jury subpoena showed that prosecutors compelled banks to share financial records of Hunter Biden and the president’s brother, James Biden. Additionally, the mother of one of Hunter Biden’s children has said she testified to authorities pursuant to a subpoena.\n\nHagerty pressed Garland on whether a special counsel is appropriate, considering the public comments by Klain and White House communications director Kate Bedingfield.\n\n“There’s an obvious conflict of interest here. Because those who are investigating the Biden family and their enterprise can be fired by the head of the family who is being investigated,” Hagerty said.\n\nGarland declined to say whether the department has or is considering appointing a special counsel, though he noted that special counsels are also employees of the Department of Justice.\n\nHe also would not answer when asked if he agreed with the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller, who was tasked with investigating allegations of collusion between Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia.\n\n“The question of whether to have a special counsel is one that is internal decision-making in the department, so I don’t want to make any judgments one way or the other,” Garland told Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) later in the hearing. “I’m quite comfortable with the United States attorney for that district continuing in the role that he’s playing.”', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/26/garland-before-senate-1200x800.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:30'}

(Andrew Burton/Getty Images)\n\nCensorship No More? The Political Fallout of Elon Musk Buying Twitter\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk has been highly critical of Twitter’s restrictions on speech. With his purchase of the social media platform and his goal of creating an open and transparent environment, there has been some discussion about the impact this could have on U.S. elections moving forward.\n\nElon Musk’s takeover of Twitter is a “huge deal,” according to Hogan Gidley, the former White House spokesman under President Donald Trump.\n\nMembers of the media, celebrities, and elected officials are among the most active users, Gidley told Steve Lance, host of NTD’s Capitol Report. This is significant since the left controls the majority of those people or entities, he added.\n\nAs a result, when information reaches the platform, you’ll witness “in unison, lockstep ideology of one side of an issue.”\n\nAccording to a Pew Research Center study, most tweets come from a small group of highly active Twitter users. About 10 percent of Twitter users in the United States account for almost 80 percent of all tweets. These accounts tweet 138 times every month, compared to the median Twitter user that tweets twice a month.\n\nA separate October 2021 Media Research Center report discovered that the Big Tech firms censored far more Republican members of Congress than their Democratic counterparts: 54-to-1.\n\nThe announcement of the buyout has outraged the left, Gidley said, not because they could be blocked on Twitter, but because Twitter could refuse to censor those they disagree with.\n\nGidley feels that social media platforms influenced the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nDuring the campaign, Twitter took an unprecedented step to block the spread of reports concerning Hunter Biden’s emails due to questions about “the origins of the materials.”\n\n“We couldn’t tweet about it at the campaign. We couldn’t talk about it in our direct messaging. We sure couldn’t do ads on it. Even though we had ads, they wouldn’t run the ads, because they collectively said it was Russian disinformation,” Gidley said.\n\n“I think it’s a serious issue. It has really influenced the outcome of elections. And quite frankly, it is a source of true evil in this country, to rip away the First Amendment freedoms.”\n\nConservatives cheered the news as they anticipate free speech will be prioritized once again, with the social network expected to abandon censorship measures like shadow banning and permanent bans.\n\nIndividuals on the other side of the political spectrum have expressed their concern about the risks to public discourse, despite Musk’s main goal to resuscitate the idea of open communications.\n\n“Let’s be clear. Elon Musk’s effort to buy Twitter is not the only threat to free communications and debate in the United States,” said the Open Markets Institute, a non-profit organization to fighting monopolies and bolstering anti-trust law and competition policy, in a statement.\n\n“The size, scope, and business models of Facebook, Google, and Amazon also pose a wide variety of often extreme threats to American democracy and the basic rights of citizens. That’s why law enforcers and Congress should view this deal as an opportunity to firmly re-establish clear bans on any manipulation of communications by essential platforms, and to eliminate all business models that rely on such manipulation.”\n\nOthers have iterated the view that the public needs to be worried about Twitter in the hands of Musk. Many prominent left-leaning individuals have pledged to leave the platform, including actress Mia Farrow, former Governor Howard Dean, author and former professional wrestler Mick Foley, and New York Times columnist Charles Blow.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) decried Musk’s acquisition, calling it “dangerous for our democracy.”\n\n“One billionaire—whose estimated net worth has gotten about 10 times larger since the start of the pandemic—is about to have the power to decide how millions of people can communicate with each other. It’s dangerous for our democracy to have so much power in so few hands,” the 2020 presidential candidate posted on Twitter.\n\nIt is unclear what critics of Musk’s ownership of Twitter are concerned about. He stated before the announcement that he hopes “that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means.”\n\nMeanwhile, whether policies and practices on the website will change heading into the 2022 electoral cycle or not remains to be seen.\n\nTwitter ignited tremendous controversy shortly before the 2020 presidential election when the website blocked links to the New York Post’s story on Hunter Biden’s laptop. But Twitter’s meddling has been apparent for years, says Jeff Brain, the CEO of CloutHub, an online networking platform for community, social, and political engagement.\n\n“It wasn’t until only 2020,” Brain told The Epoch Times. “I was there in 2018 and I was there in 2016. As we head closer to the election, you see a lot more people who have important voices and you see stories being suppressed.”\n\nCensorship should not be incorporated into the workings of social media platforms because they “are the modern-day talent squares,” Brain noted.\n\n“If you don’t have a voice on these platforms, then you don’t matter,” he added. “These platforms determine the policy in your neighborhood as well as Washington DC, and people need to be able to speak their mind and hear all the facts.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki talks to reporters during the daily news conference in the Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House on March 14, 2022. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nThe White House remarked that the U.S. government might need to look into reforming Section 230. This is a federal rule that says, “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.”\n\nWhile the Biden administration refused to comment on Musk’s deal to buy Twitter, press secretary Jen Psaki shared Biden’s concern about the power of social media.\n\n“Our concerns are not new,” Psaki told reporters Monday. “The president has long talked about his concerns about the power of social media platforms, including Twitter and others, to spread misinformation.”\n\nIn addition, the elephant in the room is Trump’s suspended account. Former president confirmed to multiple news outlets Monday that he would not be returning to Twitter, adding that he would begin participating on Truth Social soon.\n\n“No, I won’t be going back on Twitter,” Trump told CNBC’s Joe Kernen. “I will be on Truth Social within the week. It’s on schedule. We have a lot of people signed up. I like Elon Musk. I like him a lot. He’s an excellent individual. We did a lot for Twitter when I was in the White House. I was disappointed by the way I was treated by Twitter. I won’t be going back on Twitter.”\n\nEmel Akan contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/06/Twitter-logo-e1649313885998-1200x770.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:35'}

After news of Musk’s takeover, news website Politico contacted several top Republican members and aides to gauge reaction to a potential Trump Twitter return.\n\n“Every single one of them told us that they hoped the former president stays the hell away from Twitter,” Politico reported.\n\nTrump himself has said he won’t be back, telling Fox News: “I am going to be staying on Truth.”\n\nThe twice-impeached former commander-in-chief is not known for his consistency, however. He has reportedly expressed discontent with how Truth Social has performed – “What the fuck is going on,” the Daily Beast reported Trump as asking aides in March – and to return to relevance, and to win back the spotlight he craves, the former president might need Twitter.\n\n“If he wants to intervene on behalf of a candidate he has now endorsed in the midterm elections, being able to reach that number of people with messages supporting those candidates is a way of essentially getting free advertising time to reach people who are more likely to vote as a result of getting a signal from Donald Trump,” Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, told Time.\n\nTrump may have insisted that he will snub Twitter and stick with Truth Social, but his commitment to his own platform has so far been tepid at best – Trump has posted on Truth Social just once.\n\nIf that lack of interaction hasn’t helped Truth Social, neither did the botched rollout on 21 February. Tens of thousands of people were unable to access the network – the Guardian was finally allowed in on 5 March – and by early April the Truth Social app was the 355th most popular on Apple devices.\n\nIn terms of daily active users, Truth Social had 513,000, the Daily Beast reported. Twitter has about 217 million.\n\nLack of usage – both by Trump and by the general public – is not the only problem the new network faces.\n\nShares in Digital World Acquisition Corporation, the firm which plans to merge with Trump Media & Technology Group, dropped 13% on Monday after news of Musk’s deal. Since Musk became the largest shareholder in Twitter TMTG shares have fallen by 44% overall, and two key Truth Social executives quit the platform in April.\n\nSince Trump was removed from Twitter his missives have been limited to email blasts sent from his Save America Pac, the messages frequently bleating about a “stolen election” in 2020. At the moment those emails are received by a mixture of supporters and vaguely interested journalists.\n\nIf Trump resumed tweeting, he’d have a far bigger audience for his misinformation – which could have serious consequences.\n\n“The real danger would come after election day,” Gertz said, “when he could use that same megaphone to spread lies about voter fraud as a pretext for overturning elections. If that happens, another January 6 – perhaps a more successful one – is very much in play.”', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a92109698abfe8cebc8ed79f918f6e0cb5a652cf/0_156_5131_3078/master/5131.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0c9734ab4bdc644afa8fecabe2eaf914', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:03'}

Those measures aim to make the services more appealing to advertisers seeking a safe venue, and to better accommodate politicians and regulators arguing that the platforms are responsible for all of their content. But the moves have alienated some users who, like Mr. Musk, say they go overboard.\n\nHow Twitter operates won’t be entirely up to Mr. Musk.\n\n“Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules—regardless of their shareholding,” Thierry Breton, the EU regulator, wrote Tuesday on Twitter. “Mr Musk knows this well.”\n\nMr. Breton expressed confidence that Twitter, under Mr. Musk’s ownership, would conform to the bloc’s new rules, which still need formal approval from the EU Parliament and representatives from EU countries.\n\nMr. Musk’s planned changes at Twitter, and the response, will be closely watched. Twitter is smaller and less profitable than other social-media companies. It claims 217 million so-called monetizable daily users compared with 1.9 billion daily users for Meta Platforms Inc.’s core Facebook platform and a billion-plus monthly users for TikTok. But Twitter users include media personalities, politicians, activists and tech aficionados who help shape social discourse.\n\n“It has influence way beyond its user base and way beyond its valuation, and so we care about it,” said David Kaye, former United Nations special rapporteur focused on free speech and now a law professor at the University of California, Irvine.\n\nTwitter’s existing content policies haven’t brought about huge financial success; it has struggled to deliver consistent profits. Photo: Laura Morton for The Wall Street Journal\n\nMr. Musk, chief executive of Tesla Inc. and Space Exploration Technologies Corp. as well as the world’s richest person, is one of Twitter’s most prominent users, employing the platform for everything from promoting his companies to battling rivals and critics. In Monday’s deal announcement, he said he wants to open up Twitter’s algorithms to public scrutiny, “defeat” spammers and authenticate users’ identities.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Musk said he views “free speech” as that permitted by the law—a far broader definition of what is allowable than most major social networks have adopted. “I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law,” he said in a tweet. “If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect. Therefore, going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people.”\n\nSome industry executives and analysts say Mr. Musk is in for an awakening. Reversing Twitter’s efforts risks stoking advertisers’ worries about the placement of their ads, potentially pushing them toward competitors like Snap Inc. and Meta, said Ben Black, co-head of internet research at Deutsche Bank.\n\nElon Musk struck a deal on Monday to buy Twitter for about $44 billion, moving the world’s richest man a step closer to taking control of the social-media platform.

The platform often took a hands-off approach even to content from officially designated terrorist groups, drawing criticism from researchers, lawmakers and victims’ families.\n\nIt stepped up moderation over the years, removing accounts connected to the terrorist group ISIS in 2014, for example. That accelerated during and after the 2016 U.S. presidential race, which saw a jump in complaints about white nationalists and others using the platform to attack and harass minority users.\n\nOther industry leaders who favored looser policies, including Meta co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, have gradually embraced more intervention. Platforms including Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest Inc. and Reddit Inc. all have added staff or bolstered rules to monitor their content, though each draws the lines differently.\n\nTheir efforts target a range of potentially problematic content, from hate speech and false information about elections to what they see as fringe views on health, along with other issues the platforms consider harmful. Pinterest recently banned posts that it deems to contain misinformation about climate change.\n\nTwitter and other platforms also have systems allowing users to report claims of abuse by other users, which can lead to account suspensions that some of those involved say can be arbitrary or unfair.\n\nMore moderating has required complex, and often confusing, guidelines for employees and users. Such efforts have led to some divisive decisions, including bans by Twitter and Facebook of then-President Donald Trump for posts encouraging the rioters who attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, seeking to halt certification of President Biden’s electoral victory.\n\nThose bans were widely praised on the left and by some Republicans. But Mr. Trump and his supporters blasted it and have backed rival social-media apps with fewer restrictions that so far have gained limited traction, including Parler, Gab, and Gettr, which former Trump adviser Jason Miller launched last year.\n\nMany in the Trump camp have voiced support for Mr. Musk’s planned Twitter acquisition, though Mr. Trump told Fox News on Monday that he doesn’t plan to return to the platform and would instead use his social-media startup, Truth Social.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up Technology A weekly digest of tech reviews, headlines, columns and your questions answered by WSJ's Personal Tech gurus. PREVIEW\n\nDevin Nunes, CEO of Truth Social, lauded Monday’s Twitter deal, though he said he doesn’t see the platform, even under Mr. Musk, as a direct competitor because of their different target audiences. “This is a great, great day,” the Trump ally and former GOP congressman said. “Finally we’re getting some movement in the right direction here in terms of opening the internet back up and giving people their voice back.”\n\nTwitter’s existing policies haven’t brought about huge financial success; it has struggled to deliver consistent profits. And losing advertisers might not be a problem for Mr. Musk. He has said he wants the platform to rely less on advertising—which accounts for about 90% of its revenue, totaling $5.1 billion last year—and to focus more on a subscription business model. The platform currently offers Twitter Blue, a $2.99-a-month subscription service that gives customers access to premium features.\n\nDespite Mr. Trump’s comments Monday, many observers and Twitter employees are focused on Mr. Musk’s handling of the former president’s account as a potential indicator of his plans. During an all-hands meeting on Monday, Twitter CEO Parag Agarwal was asked if the company might reinstate Mr. Trump once Mr. Musk’s ownership is completed. Mr. Agarwal said it wasn’t clear.\n\n—Patience Haggin contributed to this article.\n\nElon Musk and Twitter More coverage of the billionaire's bid for Twitter, selected by editors Latest Developments\n\nWrite to Deepa Seetharaman at Deepa.Seetharaman@wsj.com and Meghan Bobrowsky at Meghan.Bobrowsky@wsj.com", 'image': 'https://images.wsj.net/im-531039/social', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:07'}

We’ll be able to have the kind of conversations that make democracy possible.”\n\nMusk’s takeover of Twitter triggered questions about whether certain users, including former President Donald Trump, would return to the platform. Trump, however, told news outlets Monday that he plans on staying with his social media site Truth Social and won’t return to Twitter.\n\n“We’re taking in millions of people, and what we’re finding is that the response on Truth is much better than being on Twitter. Twitter has bots and fake accounts, and we are doing everything we can,” Trump said. So far, Trump has only made one post on Truth Social since it was launched in February 2022.\n\nIn mid-April, Trump told Americano News that “Twitter’s become very boring” in recent months because “they’ve gotten rid of a lot of good voices on Twitter … a lot of their conservative voices.”\n\nThe deal was cemented roughly two weeks after the billionaire first revealed a 9 percent stake in the platform. Musk said last week that he had lined up $46.5 billion in financing to buy Twitter, putting pressure on the company’s board to negotiate a deal.\n\nTwitter said the transaction was unanimously approved by its board of directors and is expected to close in 2022, pending regulatory sign-off and the approval of shareholders.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2018/11/09/Tucker-Carlson-debate-1200x800.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:47'}

The constitutional protection of speech does not, on its own, engender a society in which the chance to be heard is truly abundant and free and equitably distributed.\n\n“Freedom for the wolves has often meant death to the sheep,” Mr. Berlin once said. This is a point often lost on Americans. Government — or large centralized authority — is one threat to liberty but not the only one. When it comes to speech, what has often kept a great many people from speaking isn’t censorship but the lack of a platform. Social media, including Twitter, came along and promised to change that. But when it became a cesspit of hate and harassment for women and people of color in particular, it began to offer a miserable bargain: You can be free to say what you wish, but your life can be made unrelentingly painful if you so dare.\n\nThe “censorship” that Mr. Musk performatively deplores consists of efforts to rectify these very real problems of harassment and abuse. Twitter has taken modest but wildly inadequate steps to improve safety on the platform. It has acknowledged it has a problem. It has recognized positive freedom of speech — the creation of a safe and non-life-ruining environment for the airing of thoughts. And it is this that Mr. Musk and his ilk seem to loathe.\n\nThis is why his deal to purchase Twitter is so dangerous. In recent years, there has been progress toward positive freedom of speech — real work to give everyone, truly everyone, more meaningful occasion to speak. Mr. Musk apparently wants to shut that down. Instead, in a moment of proto-fascism on the political right, his priority seems to be to undam the flood of bile and bigotry and bullying and disinformation.\n\nThe country already faces the very real prospect, starting at noon on Jan. 20, 2025, of a descent toward racist authoritarianism and a protracted slide away from liberal democracy. If your idea of what the country needs in this moment is less clamping down on hate and lies and more rightists gone wild, whew.\n\nThe plutocrats have already rigged the economy. That’s just the first step. Then you take some of the spoils and reinvest it in buying even more political influence, so that political inequality can help keep economic inequality yawning. You buy up media or social media platforms and thus can help rig the discourse in your favor, taking control of the tools used by regular people to fight back. You venture, as Mr. Musk did, to a TED conference and, without much pushback, brand yourself as a kind of public intellectual, a thought leader, a visionary, and thereby in many people’s minds you became a sage, not a robber baron.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be this way. We can have nice things. But we’re going to have to learn to see through the fraudulent stories that elevate figures like Mr. Musk into heroes. We’re going to have to legislate real guardrails — perhaps like those created by the European Union’s Digital Services Act — on social media platforms that are too big to entrust democracy to. We’re going to have to build nonprofit alternatives to the platforms and see if they can become meaningful venues.', 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/26/opinion/26giridharadas_2/26giridharadas_2-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:56'}

It can be bought or sold on crypto exchanges like Coinbase or on trading apps like Robinhood and Webull. One Dogecoin is worth 16 cents as of Tuesday morning. It's never been worth more than 64 cents. Creator Billy Markus said last year that he invented the coin as a joke.

Co-founder Jack Dorsey (right) holds a board seat, but is expected to give it up in May\n\nMusk is known for using Twitter to post inflammatory messages, much like former President Donald Trump.\n\nParag Agrawal, the CEO, said on Monday that it was up to Musk to decide whether to readmit Trump.\n\nTrump on Monday said he would not be rejoining the site if Musk allowed him to - instead saying he would continue to use his own TRUTH Social.\n\nSome experts are pointing to a tough road ahead for Twitter if Musk, who calls himself a free speech absolutist, gets his way.\n\n'We expect advertisers will be less willing to spend on Twitter if Elon Musk removes content moderation in order to promote free speech,' MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson said.\n\nThe 16-year old company, which has emerged as one of the world's most influential online public squares with about over 200 million users, reported $4.51 billion in ad revenue for 2021, accounting for about 89% of its overall sales.\n\n'The challenge (for Twitter) will be maintaining and building revenue given that the controversial opinions (Musk) hopes to give more of a free rein to are often unpalatable to advertisers,' Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Susannah Streeter said.\n\nTesla tycoon versus Big Tech: How swashbuckling billionaire Elon Musk fought off 'poison pill', lawsuits and hostile board of directors before $44bn Twitter takeover\n\nIt has been one of the most dramatic takeover attempts in history, seeing a swashbuckling billionaire pitted against one of the largest tech giants in the world.\n\nBut Elon Musk's seizing of Twitter has been a months-long pursuit that has seen him send shockwaves through the world of business.\n\nThe Tesla magnate started hoarding shares in the social media firm at the start of the year in an apparent bid to preserve free speech online.\n\nHe quickly rocketed to the top of its shareholders' list, acquiring a huge 9% stake in the tech giant.\n\nBut then he hit choppy waters, accepting a place on the board then rejecting it, getting embroiled in lawsuits and seeing rival companies circle to buy Twitter.\n\nMeanwhile bosses at the social media firm appeared to do all they could to ensure he could not not seize it - even launching a 'poison pill' strategy to sink his chances.\n\nYet Musk brazenly blasted through all the obstacles, punting a $43 billion offer earlier this month and showing how he would finance it.\n\nThe two sides were reportedly working into the early morning on Monday to finalize the 'fast-moving' negotiations.\n\nIt saw Twitter shares in the US soar by four percent as the markets opened to $50.84 a share.\n\nOn Monday, Musk called for his 'worst critics' to remain on the platform because 'that is what free speech means'.\n\nHere, DailyMail.com looks at the rollercoaster journey he has been on over the last few months as he seizes his prize.\n\n\n\nThe Tesla magnate started hoarding shares in the social media firm at the start of the year in an apparent bid to preserve free speech online\n\nJanuary 31: Musk hoards Twitter shares and buys them 'almost daily'\n\nMusk started buying Twitter stock on January 31 and continued to buy shares during every trading session through April 1, according to an SEC filing.\n\nJust days earlier, he told his 80 million followers on the site he was ' giving serious thought ' to creating his own social media platform.\n\nA user asked him: 'Would you consider building a new social media platform, @elonmusk?\n\n'One that would consist an open source algorithm, one where free speech and adhering to free speech is given top priority, one where propaganda is very minimal. I think that kind of a platform is needed.'\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO replied through his official account: 'Am giving serious thought to this.'\n\nThe billionaire businessman, 50, appeared to be suggesting he was sick of Twitter over the right to freedom of speech.\n\nApril 4: Musk says he bought 9.2 percent stake in firm a month earlier\n\nMusk revealed he had purchased a 9.2 percent stake in the social media giant on March 14.\n\nHe tweeted 'oh hi lol' after the news sent shockwaves through the business world and across social media. He added: 'Do you want an edit button?'\n\nApril 5: He joins Twitter's board of directors - sees share price rocket\n\nTwitter said the tech tycoon was joining the company's board of directors, causing the social media platform's shares to rise over 7 per cent in premarket trading.\n\nIt led to speculation he would try to address what he called the platform's 'failure to adhere to free speech principles' and 'fundamentally undermine democracy'.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Musk would have served on the board until the company's 2024 annual shareholders meeting.\n\nAs long as he remains a director, the agreement said, he could not won more than 14.9 percent of the company's stock.\n\nIt meant he would not have been able to take over the company until well after his term on the board was over.\n\nThe firm said: 'Twitter is committed to impartiality in the development and enforcement of its policies and rules.\n\n'Our policy decisions are not determined by the Board or shareholders, and we have no plans to reverse any policy decisions.'\n\n'As always our Board plays an important advisory and feedback role across the entirety of our service.\n\n'Our day to day operations and decisions are made by Twitter management and employees.'\n\nApril 8: Asset managers take over Musk as largest shareholders\n\nAsset manager Vanguard Group increased its stake to overtake Musk as the largest shareholder.\n\nVanguard owned 10.3 percent of Twitter, while the Tesla tycoon owned 9.1 per cent, making him the largest individual shareholder.\n\nVanguard, led by CEO Tim Buckley, increased its stake in the company at some point during the first quarter, according to SEC filings made on April 8.\n\nIt previously reported owning 67.2million shares of Twitter or about 8.4 per cent of the company as of the end of December, according to FactSet.\n\nOther owners of large quantities of Twitter stock included Morgan Stanley, Fidelity and Black Rock.\n\nVanguard, led by CEO Tim Buckley, increased its stake in the company at some point during the first quarter, according to SEC filings made on April 8\n\nApril 9: Musk rejects the offer to join Twitter's board of directors\n\nMusk rejected an offer to join Twitter's board after disclosing his stake in the company.\n\nAnalysts said the move signaled his intention to take over the company as a board seat would have limited his stake to just under 15 per cent.\n\nParag Agrawal said the board would still 'remain open' to Musk's input, but warned: 'There will be distractions ahead but our goals and priorities remain unchanged.'\n\nHe said: 'The board and I had many discussions about Elon joining the board, and with Elon directly. We were excited to collaborate and clear about the risks.\n\n'We also believed that having Elon as a fiduciary of the company where he, like all board members, has to act in the best interests of the company and all our shareholders, was the best path forward. The board offered him a seat.'\n\nAgrawal continued: 'We announced on Tuesday that Elon would be appointed to the board contingent on a background check and formal acceptance.\n\n'Elon's appointment to the board was to become officially effective 4/9, but Elon shared that same morning that he will no longer be joining the board.'\n\nParag Agrawal said the board would still 'remain open' to Musk's input, but warned: 'There will be distractions ahead but our goals and priorities remain unchanged'\n\nApril 12: Twitter shareholder Marc Bain Rasella files suit against Musk\n\nMarc Bain Rasella filed a lawsuit against Musk for alleged securities fraud at a Manhattan federal court, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nThe suit claimed the billionaire was required to disclose his holdings to the SEC by March 24, but the delay kept Twitter's share price down allowing Musk to buy more.\n\nMusk was accused of violating a regulatory deadline to reveal he had accumulated a stake of at least five per cent.\n\nInstead, according to the complaint, Musk did not disclose his position in Twitter until he had almost doubled his stake to more than nine per cent.\n\nThat strategy, the lawsuit alleges, hurt less wealthy investors who sold shares in the company in the nearly two weeks before Musk acknowledged holding a major stake.\n\nApril 14: The Tesla tycoon offers to buy Twitter for $43 BILLION\n\nMusk offered to buy Twitter for $43billion, a regulatory filing showed, as he moved to seize the social media giant.\n\nMusk's offer price of $54.20 per share represented a 38 per cent premium to the closing price of Twitter's stock on April 1.\n\nThis was the last trading day before the Tesla CEO's over nine per cent investment in the company was publicly announced.\n\nIt even appeared to reference marijuana - also known as 420 - a common reference used by Musk on Twitter.\n\nTwitter said in a regulatory filing Musk provided a letter containing a proposal to buy the remaining shares of Twitter he did not already own.\n\nApril 15: Twitter launches 'poison pill' strategy to stop Musk buyout\n\nTwitter's board announced a dramatic poison pill plan to prevent Musk from increasing his stake in the company.\n\nAlso known as a shareholder rights provision, the plan would trigger a dilution of shares if any shareholder builds up a 15 per cent stake without the board's approval.\n\nThe plan did not prevent Twitter from accepting Musk's offer or entering negotiations with him or other potential buyers.\n\nBut it did stop the billionaire from putting pressure on the board by buying up ever more shares on the open market.\n\nMusk hit back with a laughing emoji to a version of the classic 'Distracted Boyfriend' meme mocking Twitter's board.\n\nThe imaged depicted 'Twitter's board' looking wistfully at the option to 'keep that easy gig that gives me shares' as 'Twitter investors' look on with disgust.\n\nTwitter's board is led by chairman Bret Taylor, who is also the co-CEO of business software giant Salesforce\n\nApril 16: Musk tweets Love Me Tender in tease of hostile takeover\n\nMusk tweeted 'Love Me Tender' as he again teased at the possibility of a hostile takeover of Twitter.\n\nThe billionaire posted the Elvis Presley lyrics in a potential bid to lure shareholders with a tender offer that could see him seize control.\n\nA tender offer would see him bypass the board and go to shareholders with his offer of $54.20 a share - but he would need to show how he would finance his bid.\n\nHe also appeared to suggest he would strip board members of their salaries, saying they would get '$0 if my bid succeeds'.\n\nApril 18: Jack Dorsey slams the Twitter board for 'plots and coups'\n\nJack Dorsey slammed the board of Twitter as he weighed into the toxic fight over Elon Musk's attempted hostile takeover for the first time.\n\nThe former CEO, who is still a member of the board himself, blasted the 'plots and coups' that were 'consistently the dysfunction of the company'.\n\nIn a series of bombshell tweets and replies, he endorsed one posting saying that 'a bad board will kill a company every time'.\n\nReplying to one post, he said: 'When I was fired in 2008 and made chair, the board took most of my shares away from me.\n\n'I also gave 1 per cent of the company back to the employee pool in 2015. So, ended up with very little of company.'\n\nHe also replied to one comment mentioning 'plots and coups' in the Twitter board saying: 'it's consistently been the dysfunction of the company'.\n\nEarlier in the thread, he replied to a post quoting a 'Silicon Valley proverb' by venture capitalist Fred Destin.\n\nIt said: 'Good boards don't create good companies, but a bad board will kill a company every time.' Dorsey said: 'Big facts.'\n\nFormer CEO Dorsey slammed Twitter's board of directors on as he replied to a series of unfriendly tweets\n\nApril 21: SpaceX boss unveils his $46.5billion financing package\n\nElon Musk unveiled his $46.5billion financing package to fund his takeover of Twitter - using Tesla as collateral.\n\nThe world's richest man filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission outlining how he would seize the social media giant.\n\nHe committed $21billion in equity, $13billion from Morgan Stanley in debt facilities and another $12.5billion from the bank and others in margin loans.\n\nBut 'a portion' of his shares in Tesla have been put forward as collateral, which analysts feared could have a huge impact on the firm.\n\nThe 50-year-old billionaire also revealed he was weighing up launching a tender offer for Twitter after the company ignored his acquisition offer.\n\nHe said he was exploring getting stocks directly from shareholders but admitted he 'has not determined whether to do so at this time'.\n\nMusk filed the document with the SEC showing how he planned to take over Twitter for about $46.5billion.\n\nHe secured a debt commitment letter from Morgan Stanley Senior Funding to the tune of $13billion in financing.\n\nThis was made up of a loan of $6.5billion, a senior secured revolving facility for $500million, a bridge loan of up to $3billion and an unsecured bridge loan for up to $3billion.\n\nHe also got a margin loan commitment letter from Morgan Stanley for $12.5 billion in margin loans. And Musk also got $21billion through equity financing.\n\nBut he has used 'a portion' of his shares in Tesla as collateral in the high-stakes move, which analysts warned could have huge ramifications for the company.\n\nApril 22: Musk posts 'boner' killer picture of Bill Gates on Twitter\n\nMusk dissed Bill Gates' gut on Twitter, posting a photo of the Microsoft mogul next to Apple's controversial pregnant man emoji 'in case you need to lose a boner.'\n\nHe posted a follow-up image in response to the Friday post of six hooded figured captioned 'shadow ban council reviewing Tweet'.\n\nThe joke could further infuriate woke Twitter staffers angered by Musk's ongoing bid to buy the firm after saying he would support free speech.\n\nThat is because the pregnant man emoji is aimed at being inclusive to transgender people - with Musk frequently taking aim at what he sees as woke overreach.\n\nApril 25: Musk finalizes deal to buy Twitter\n\nMusk was closing in on seizing Twitter as talks between the Tesla magnate and the tech giant entered their final stages, reports say.\n\nThe tycoon's representatives were said to be hammering out terms including a timeline and fees if an agreement was signed and then fell apart.\n\nThe two sides were reportedly working into the early morning to finalize the 'fluid and fast-moving' negotiations.\n\nTwitter shares soared by four percent as the markets opened to $50.84 a share amid reports it would be seized by Musk.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Twitter announced it had 'entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by an entity wholly owned by Elon Musk, for $54.20 per share in cash in a transaction valued at approximately $44 billion. Upon completion of the transaction, Twitter will become a privately held company.'", 'image': 'https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/26/14/57069119-0-image-a-49_1650980561815.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:46'}

TWTR -3.91% will need to follow the bloc’s new rules for tackling illegal and harmful content online if it wants to keep operating there, marking a possible challenge to Elon Musk’s plans to take a more hands-off approach to content moderation.\n\nThierry Breton, EU internal market commissioner, said Tuesday in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that it’s his job to make sure companies, including Twitter, understand their obligations in Europe. That will soon include a series of new obligations for social media and other online platforms, called the Digital Services Act, after lawmakers agreed to the main points of the legislation last week.\n\n“Now we have very clear rules,” Mr. Breton said. “They can do whatever they want outside of Europe…but in Europe they will just have to fulfill [our] rules and obligations.”\n\nThe Digital Services Act aims to force platforms to take more responsibility for the content their users post online.

The move would allow Musk to make changes to the site. WSJ’s Dan Gallagher explains Musk’s proposed changes and the challenges he might face enacting them.

While there are questions about whether the European Commission will have the resources to fully enforce the new law, Prof. Tobias said, “I do think [Mr. Musk] is on notice, and Twitter shareholders, too.”\n\nMr. Musk wrote on Twitter Tuesday afternoon that his view of free speech is speech that “matches the law.”\n\n“I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law,” he said. “If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect.”\n\nMr. Breton said the EU was careful in setting its regulations to maintain freedom of speech. He said he had interactions with many platforms during the lawmaking process and was open to meeting with others, in a comment that appeared to be aimed at Mr. Musk. “If any new shareholder of these platforms is willing to engage with me, my door will be totally open, like always,” he said.\n\nThe EU’s new legislation won’t prevent Mr. Musk from taking a more free-speech-oriented approach, said Zach Meyers, a senior research fellow with the Centre for European Reform think tank. However, he said Twitter will still need to comply with rules on the removal of illegal content, which would likely require hiring more people to deal with content moderation and complaints.\n\nElon Musk and Twitter More coverage of the billionaire's bid for Twitter, selected by editors Latest Developments\n\nWrite to Kim Mackrael at kim.mackrael@wsj.com", 'image': 'https://images.wsj.net/im-531712/social', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:24'}

In the wake of this "great deplatforming," Republicans\' longstanding gripes with these platforms became a legislative priority.\n\nOne of the most aggressive of these Republican-led efforts to regulate social media is Texas\' H.B. 20. Ostensibly passed to combat the "dangerous movement by social media companies to silence conservative viewpoints and ideas," this bill prohibits social media platforms from removing users or content "based on the viewpoint" of the user or content. In its effort to protect conservative speech, Texas Republicans have adopted a historically discredited left-wing legal theory, dispensing with core conservative values in the process.\n\nIn the 1960s, a group of progressive scholars argued that the First Amendment does not merely prohibit the government from censoring private speech and press. In fact, they argued, it granted the government the affirmative power to control the mass media. In a capitalist system, they reasoned, the government must ensure that private media owners do not exclude unwelcome viewpoints, in order to protect the "democratic interest" in free speech. To this end, the scholars championed the Fairness Doctrine, right-of-reply mandates, and expansive applications of "common carriage" doctrine, which enable the government to force the inclusion of certain content.\n\nBorrowing from the same playbook, Texas now argues that First Amendment values require, rather than prohibit, government interference with private speech. H.B. 20 declares that social media platforms are common carriers like telephone companies and thus are subject to onerous restrictions over who and what they may host. According to Texas, H.B. 20 serves the democratic interest in protecting the free exchange of ideas and information. But like the collectivist efforts that preceded it, Texas\' misguided attempt to advance "First Amendment rights in the Lone Star State" violates private platforms\' First Amendment rights to choose what speech they publish.\n\nAs we explained in a recently filed amicus curiae brief on behalf of the Cato Institute, courts have repeatedly rejected such regulations, and for good reasons.\n\nFirst, as a federal district court correctly noted last year, the First Amendment protects social media platforms\' discretion to publish or remove content. The Supreme Court established this right in the 1974 case Miami Herald Publishing Company v. Tornillo, when it struck down a Florida law that forced newspapers to print responses to their criticism of political candidates. The Court explained that this "right-of-reply" law infringed on newspapers\' right to choose what content they publish.\n\nThe Supreme Court affirmed that First Amendment rights apply with full force to internet media in 1997\'s Reno v. ACLU. Other federal courts have since upheld the editorial rights of search engines and social media sites. These precedents doom the Texas law. The state can\'t eviscerate platforms\' well-established First Amendment rights by arbitrarily calling them common carriers.\n\nSecond, efforts like H.B. 20 chill, rather than encourage, the exercise of free speech. Both the Florida right-of-reply law and the Fairness Doctrine actually discouraged the media from covering controversial topics that would trigger the forced-hosting requirements. Likewise, H.B. 20 will encourage platforms to ban entire subjects (say, discussions of terrorism) to avoid facing the unappetizing choice to either host objectionable viewpoints (such as pro-terrorism material) or face liability for removing each piece of content.\n\nThird, H.B. 20 violates fundamental property rights by forcing private platforms to host users and content they would otherwise exclude. The First Amendment does not authorize the government to co-opt private property to amplify certain viewpoints.\n\nThe supporters of the Texas law, like other conservative opponents of Big Tech, cite anecdotal accounts of inconsistent content moderation to support their claim of unfair bias. But it\'s more likely that these incidents are just casualties of the margin of error inherent in content moderation at scale. "Incorrect" removals of content happen millions of times per day to users representing every conceivable ideology. Conservatives are removed from platforms when they violate platforms\' terms of service, but Texas\' premise that conservatives are being unfairly targeted is unsubstantiated.\n\nBut even if it was substantiated, forced-hosting laws like H.B. 20 would contravene limited government, constitutional fidelity, and strong property rights, all of which are supposed to be core conservative values. If Texas Republicans really want to protect "conservative viewpoints," they should reacquaint themselves with those principles and reject giving the government more control over social media.', 'image': 'https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2022/04/timothy-hales-bennett-OwvRB-M3GwE-unsplash-scaled.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:31'}

It is a reminder why we need a wealth tax and why we need some serious regulation for Big Tech. One billionaire should not be able to turn the world upside down just because he plays by a different set of rules,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who believes the government should break up Big Tech companies to promote more competition.\n\nAsked whether Musk’s acquisition of Twitter was cause for concern, Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said: “Absolutely it does.”\n\n“He said he wants to make it this global message board. My first question to him, ‘Is your message board going to include Donald Trump?’ ” he said. “That’s a key question. If he lets that man rant and rave on Twitter, not in the best interests of America’s’ future.”\n\nDurbin, who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee, noted that his and other panels are exploring whether it would be appropriate to impose new regulations on Big Tech companies to incentivize them to do more to moderate content.\n\nSpeaking at Stanford last week, Obama said tech firms “need to be more transparent about how they operate” and crack down on “lies and conspiracy theories” that threaten the nation’s democratic system.\n\n“Without some standards, implications of this technology — for our elections, for our legal system, for our democracy, for rules of evidence, for our entire social order — are frightening and profound,” he warned.\n\nMusk hasn’t said whether he’ll let Trump, who was permanently barred from Twitter in January 2021, back on the platform, but his recent comments have fueled speculation that he might do so. Trump has indicated he’s not interested in getting back on Twitter, though he is known for changing his mind.\n\nSen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he also had concerns about what Musk’s purchase of Twitter might mean for the platform’s content standards.\n\nHe said he was looking into the matter but declined to provide any detail.\n\n“I’ve got some concerns. I think it will have to go through … some level of appropriate regulatory [review], and I’m doing some of my own checking,” he said.\n\nSen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) said Musk’s control over a major forum for political debate is alarming.\n\n“It’s always a concern when an oligarch may be owning the town square. I think we do need to pay a lot of attention to how it’s managed,” he said.\n\nMusk’s takeover of Twitter raises questions about what it means for his settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over fraud charges stemming from his August 2018 tweet that he had secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 per share, which pushed the car company’s stock higher.\n\nUnder the settlement, Musk must allow a Tesla lawyer to review any tweets containing material business information before hitting the send button.\n\nSen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), the chairwoman of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, said allowing Trump back on Twitter would be a major problem.\n\n“I think that’s very problematic,” she said of Trump’s possible return. “I don’t think that somebody who encouraged and organized a violent insurrection to take over our government should be allowed on Twitter.”\n\nAsked about the loosening of content standards, she said she “would certainly have concerns” but added she hadn’t looked at the deal closely enough to “get into a big analysis.”\n\nTrump, who has launched a social media venture that includes a platform intended to vie with Twitter, told Fox News on Monday that he doesn’t plan to return to Twitter.\n\n“I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,” he said, referring to his Truth Social messaging platform, before the deal was announced. “I hope Elon buys Twitter because he’ll make improvements to it and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth. The bottom line is, no, I am not going back to Twitter.”\n\nTwitter permanently suspended Trump because of what it called “the risk of further incitement of violence” after a mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to halt the certification of President Biden’s victory.\n\nTwitter later unveiled a civic integrity policy that prohibited the use of its services for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes. It also reserved the right to flag or reduce the visibility of tweets containing false or misleading information about civic processes.\n\nAt a TED conference this month, Musk stressed the importance of allowing free speech on Twitter.\n\n“Twitter has become kind of the de facto town square, so it’s just really important that people have both the reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely within the bounds of the law,” he said.\n\nConservatives on Monday applauded Musk’s move.\n\n“Elon Musk did his part for free speech today. Let’s hope the Supreme Court does as well,” former Rep. Mark Walker (N.C.), a conservative Republican running for Senate, tweeted Monday afternoon.\n\nDemocrats are worried what that means for policing claims that Biden stole the 2020 presidential election or misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n“I’m a big free speech guy, but this stuff isn’t working. It’s terrorizing democracy, and from that perspective I think it’s bad for Democrats in this sense: These Republican alt groups tend to dominate.

As YouTube celebrates its 17th birthday, the game-changing user-generated video platform once known for funny pet videos and other benign content continues to attract criticism for its alleged role in fostering extremism. Ample evidence casts doubt on the idea that social media platforms are radicalizing American youth, but high-profile anecdotes about bad turns allegedly inspired by YouTube, Facebook, and other sites make it hard to combat such claims. Now one such story may come before the Supreme Court—and threaten a foundational internet speech law.\n\nThe case (Gonzalez v. Google LLC) involves a man whose daughter was killed in a 2015 ISIS attack in Paris. The grieving father, Reynaldo Gonzalez, sued YouTube\'s parent company, Google, under the U.S. Anti-Terrorism Act. Gonzalez claims that ISIS posted recruitment videos on YouTube, that YouTube recommended these videos to users, and that this led to his daughter\'s death.\n\nGonzalez\'s circumstances are tragic, but his claim is convoluted and patently illogical. To buy it, you have to buy the idea that without YouTube, the terrorist group not only would be unable to recruit members but would cease to use existing networks to carry out attacks.\n\nThe Supreme Court has not yet decided whether it will hear Gonzalez\'s case. But if it does, it could give the Court a chance to consider the parameters of Section 230, the federal law preventing internet companies and users from being liable for all third-party speech (and pretty much the backbone of the internet as we know it).\n\nSCOTUSblog notes that in 2020, Justice Clarence Thomas suggested that "in an appropriate case, we should consider whether the text of this increasingly important statute aligns with the current state of immunity enjoyed by Internet platforms." (Thomas made a similar suggestion earlier this year.)\n\n"The petition in Gonzalez v. Google LLC tries to present itself as the case Thomas has been looking for," writes Andrew Hamm:\n\nThe district court dismissed Gonzalez\'s claim on the ground that Section 230 nonetheless protected Google for its recommendations because ISIS produced the videos, not Google. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit affirmed, concluding that Section 230 protects such recommendations, at least if the provider\'s algorithm treated content on its website similarly. However, the panel in Gonzalez considered itself bound to reach this result because of a recent case on the same issue that another 9th Circuit panel decided while Gonzalez was pending. The Gonzalez panel further concluded that, if it could resolve the question itself, Section 230 would not protect a provider\'s content recommendations. Gonzalez admits that the circuits to face this question are not split. Instead, Gonzalez suggests that, had his case simply come out before the other 9th Circuit decision, then Google would be the one seeking review. Regardless, he maintains, the providers\' financial dependence on advertisements and hence on algorithms that can target users makes this question of recommendations important to resolve.\n\nGonzalez is far from the first person to sue social media companies over terrorist acts. But these people "have yet to talk a court into agreeing with their arguments," as Tim Cushing noted at Techdirt last fall.\n\n"The facts in these cases are invariably awful: often people have been brutally killed and their loved ones are seeking redress for their loss. There is a natural, and perfectly reasonable, temptation to give them some sort of remedy from someone, but as we argued in our brief, that someone cannot be an internet platform," wrote constitutional lawyer Cathy Gellis in 2017:\n\nThere are several reasons for this, including some that have nothing to do with Section 230. For instance, even if Section 230 did not exist and platforms could be liable for the harms resulting from their users\' use of their services, for them to be liable there would have to be a clear connection between the use of the platform and the harm.\n\nSection 230 "should prevent a court from ever even reaching the tort law analysis," added Gellis. "With Section 230, a platform should never find itself having to defend against liability for harm that may have resulted from how people used it."\n\nA new study backs up what advocates for Section 230 have been saying for a long time: The law protects small companies and creators more than big tech giants.\n\n"If you understand the mechanisms by which Section 230 actually works, the key is that it gets frivolous and wasteful lawsuits kicked out of court much earlier—when the costs are still intense, but more bearable," points out Mike Masnick in a Techdirt post about the study. "Without Section 230, the end result of the court case may be the same—where the company wins—but the costs would be much, much higher. For Facebook and Google that\'s not going to make a huge difference. But for smaller companies, it can be the difference between life and death."\n\n"Larger enterprises are less impacted by lawsuits," point out the authors of the study, in a report titled "Understanding Section 230 & the Impact of Litigation on Small Providers." A large company "may already have: 1) lawyers ready to deal with lawsuits (allowing the business to continue with minimal disruption); 2) insurance coverage that can offset the cost of a defense, a settlement, or a damage award; and 3) sufficient revenue and cash reserves such that most cases are viewed as a cost of doing business rather than a cataclysmic event."\n\nSmall companies are less likely to have or be able to afford any of these things, making it less likely that they will fight even lawsuits that they would win.\n\nPoliticians, alas, have taken to scapegoating Section 230 for basically anything they or their constituents don\'t like about the internet. And lawyers keep getting creative in their anti–Section 230 arguments, suggesting that while Section 230 may broadly protect internet platforms from liability for many things that users post, the law does not covers various facets of these platforms—their design, their algorithms, etc..\n\nOccasionally, judges appear sympathetic to this. In Taamneh v. Twitter, which the 9th Circuit ruled on last year, Judge Marsha Berzon wrote that Section 230 protects "only traditional activities of publication and distribution—such as deciding whether to publish, withdraw, or alter content—and does not include activities that promote or recommend content or connect content users to each other. I urge this Court to reconsider our precedent en banc to the extent that it holds that section 230 extends to the use of machine-learning algorithms to recommend content and connections to users."\n\n"This is a really weird, really dangerous place to start drawing the line in Section 230 lawsuits," wrote Tim Cushing last summer. "Algorithms react to input from users. If YouTube can\'t be held directly responsible for videos uploaded by users, it makes sense it would be immunized against algorithmically suggesting content based on users\' actions and preferences. The algorithm does next to nothing on its own without input from content viewers. It takes a user to really get it moving."\n\nFREE MINDS\n\nA federal appeals court has rejected a university\'s ban on "discriminatory harassment." The University of Central Florida\'s "discriminatory harassment" ban likely violates the First Amendment, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals said. The case is Speech First, Inc. v. Cartwright, and you can read the whole ruling here. In essence, the court found the school\'s policy against allegedly discriminatory speech to be too broad:\n\n[T]he policy (1) prohibits a wide range of "verbal, physical, electronic, and other" expression concerning any of (depending on how you count) some 25 or so characteristics; (2) states that prohibited speech "may take many forms, including verbal acts, name-calling, graphic or written statements" and even "other conduct that may be humiliating"; (3) employs a gestaltish "totality of known circumstances" approach to determine whether particular speech, for instance, "unreasonably alters" another student\'s educational experience; and (4) reaches not only a student\'s own speech, but also her conduct "encouraging," "condoning," or "failing to intervene" to stop another student\'s speech. The policy, in short, is staggeringly broad, and any number of statements—some of which are undoubtedly protected by the First Amendment—could qualify for prohibition under its sweeping standards. To take a few obvious examples, the policy targets "verbal, physical, electronic or other conduct" based on "race," "ethnicity," "religion [or] non-religion," "sex," and "political affiliation." Among the views that Speech First\'s members have said they want to advocate are that "abortion is immoral," that the government "should not be able to force religious organizations to recognize marriages with which they disagree," that "affirmative action is deeply unfair," that "a man cannot become a woman because he \'feels\' like one," that "illegal immigration is dangerous," and that "the Palestinian movement is anti-Semitic."\n\nIn a concurring opinion, Judge Stanley Marcus warned against "the grave peril posed by a policy that effectively polices adherence to intellectual dogma."\n\n"History provides us with ample warning of those times and places when colleges and universities have stopped pursuing truth and have instead turned themselves into cathedrals for the worship of certain dogma," wrote Marcus. "By depriving itself of academic institutions that pursue truth over any other concern, a society risks falling into the abyss of ignorance. Humans are not smart enough to have ideas that lie beyond challenge and debate."\n\nThe Volokh Conspiracy has more on the ruling (which includes the lovely line "the state is a really big boy") here.\n\nFREE MARKETS\n\nPrivate space mission on its way back to earth. The first privately-funded trip to the International Space Station started its return trip yesterday. More from CNN:\n\nThe mission, called AX-1, was brokered by the Houston, Texas-based startup Axiom Space, which books rocket rides, provides all the necessary training, and coordinates flights to the ISS for anyone who can afford it. The four crew members—Michael López-Alegría, a former NASA astronaut-turned-Axiom employee who is commanding the mission; Israeli businessman Eytan Stibbe; Canadian investor Mark Pathy; and Ohio-based real estate magnate Larry Connor—left the space station aboard their SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule on Sunday at 9:10 pm EST….They will spend about one day free flying through orbit before plummeting back into the atmosphere and parachuting to a splashdown landing off the coast of Florida around 1 pm ET Monday. AX-1, which launched on April 8, was originally billed as a 10-day mission, but delays extended the mission by about a week.\n\nThis isn\'t the first time private citizens have been able to pay for seats on spacecraft. "But AX-1 is the first mission with a crew entirely comprised of private citizens with no active members of a government astronaut corps accompanying them in the capsule during the trip to and from the ISS," reports CNN. "It\'s also the first time private citizens have traveled to the ISS on a US-made spacecraft."\n\nAnd it\'s also a powerful reminder that perhaps the next era of space exploration needn\'t be government funded and managed.\n\nQUICK HITS\n\n• Air Force Major General William T.

The world\'s wealthiest man offered to buy the social media site for $44 billion, and the company\'s board accepted the offer yesterday.\n\nMusk has many reasons for buying the company, but his main drive appears to be to preserve—or even strengthen—the site\'s commitment to the principles of free speech.\n\n"Twitter is the digital town square, where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated," tweeted Musk.\n\nAdmittedly, the town square analogy is imperfect, as my colleague Liz Wolfe highlighted in her excellent post on the subject. For one thing, Twitter is a private company, rather than a genuinely public space, which means that it is not bound by the First Amendment. Unlike the actual town square, Twitter retains the right to punish users for perfectly legal speech. It\'s also the case that while Twitter is incredibly important for the political class, journalists, business leaders, and other social influencers, it\'s not nearly as big or as frequently visited as Facebook, YouTube, or TikTok. As Techdirt\'s Mike Masnick put it, the entire internet is really the town square; Twitter is one small space that\'s part of it.\n\nTwitter\'s social importance is inflated by media and political figures because the site is their preferred virtual meeting ground. This is true of Musk himself; he clearly enjoys the platform, and uses it to great effect, and thus may be overstating its importance to society. But there are many others ways to communicate political messages, and if Twitter ceased to exist tomorrow, it\'s doubtful that anyone\'s ability to speak would be irreparably harmed.\n\nAdmittedly, the people really overstating Twitter\'s importance are actually Musk\'s critics in progressive and mainstream media. And boy are they overstating it: Current Affairs Editor in Chief Nathan Robinson fretted that "the only comforting reason to think [former President] Donald Trump might not win in 2024 is that his prior success was so dependent on his Twitter account. If Musk takes over it\'s very likely that Trump will be back and therefore unstoppable."\n\nThe only comforting reason to think Donald Trump might not win in 2024 is that his prior success was so dependent on his Twitter account. If Musk takes over it\'s very likely that Trump will be back and therefore unstoppable. — Nathan J Robinson (@NathanJRobinson) April 25, 2022\n\nRobinson apparently thinks that Trump\'s ability to win reelection hinges on whether he\'s on Twitter. Not the shape of the U.S. economy, the direction of the pandemic, or whether President Joe Biden\'s ill-considered policies have created an opening for the former president…but Twitter.\n\nFrustratingly, many liberals and progressives—especially in the media—have convinced themselves that the only way to effectively counter bad speech is to label it misinformation or harassment and prevent it from being uttered. This runs counter to Musk\'s stated views on the subject, which reflect classically liberal ideas about speech.\n\nI hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 25, 2022\n\nIt\'s strange to see this idea—that silencing opponents is not only self-defeating but also wrong on principle—transformed into an explicitly right-wing talking point. This is a demoralizing result of the new political reality, in which the journalists and bureaucrats who comprise Team Blue fear and distrust speech they cannot control, while Team Red purports to love free speech even as its political figures wage war on speech they do not like. And it\'s one that does not work to Democrats\' advantage; as Nate Silver points out, free speech in the abstract is extremely popular among the voting public.\n\nThe best way to de-politicize the social media free speech debate—and the optimal thing that Musk could do with control of Twitter—would be to devolve content curation to individual users, as I explained in The Los Angeles Times:\n\n"Elon Musk\'s best bet would be to devolve content curation to individual users. Many on the right are frustrated with Twitter\'s inconsistently applied rules, regardless of whether they are enforced by algorithms or by human employees of the company; many progressives, on the other hand, are afraid that lax moderation means more misinformation or harassment. The least polarizing way forward is to give users more means of controlling their own feeds. If you have a low tolerance for unpleasantness, you should be able to turn on a setting that shields you from the worst of what can appear on the platform. If you prefer the Wild West, there should be a setting for you, too."\n\nIn any case, I hope that fixing Twitter doesn\'t distract Musk from his far more important goal of colonizing Mars (something NPR criticized as imperialist, because of course they did).

Musk haters have taken to the site to declare that Donald Trump will now probably win the 2024 election, that Musk\'s bid is really about white power, that Section 230 must be reformed, and that, yes, Musk\'s new policies will be lethal. (Perhaps the death toll will be even larger than net neutrality\'s!)\n\nSo, for users of the platform, what\'s likely to change?\n\nMusk has panned the site\'s existing content moderation policies, saying they are too restrictive and encroach on people\'s ability to speak freely without being censored. Some liberalization of these policies and the re-platforming of controversial figures like former President Donald Trump—who was banned in the wake of the January 6 riot for inciting violence among his fans—seems likely, though unpopular with droves of users.\n\nAt the mid-April TED conference in Vancouver, Musk talked about his interest in making Twitter\'s algorithm open-source. The Diff\'s Byrne Hobart took this a step further, outlining how "Twitter should monetize a protocol rather than run an app," and explaining the tension between Twitter as a consumer product and as "a way for individual users to update a universal shared database, which can then be filtered based on who\'s interested in what." Hobart claims that it\'s possible that Twitter has been "radically miss-monetized," and that Musk could potentially realign its priorities. However, little of the online discourse has focused on the technical possibilities.\n\nThe new Twitter owner has, through coy tweets, hinted that his new policies will not be applied arbitrarily and that consistent application will mean some number of right-wing users currently cheering his new ownership will surely be disappointed:\n\nI hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 25, 2022\n\nA social media platform\'s policies are good if the most extreme 10% on left and right are equally unhappy — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 19, 2022\n\nElsewhere, Musk has said that Twitter is a "town square" or "public square," and that banning people from using the platform effectively prevents them from participating in the important discussions of the day.\n\nThough people who care about fostering a culture of free speech may agree with the tenor of Musk\'s comments, the analogy is a terrible one. For most of America, the public square is the school board meeting and the town council meeting. There are also numerous other privates spaces for civic engagement: the church pulpit and the post-sermon fray it inspires; neighborhood listservs and the cesspool that is NextDoor; or maybe it\'s Facebook, in-person conversations, and email lists. For many millions of Americans, Twitter is not integral to hashing out values, concerns, and disagreements. Think of the implications if we expected the government to treat such companies—which have their own terms of service and standards that they are free to decide and we are free to consent to—as something akin to public utilities.\n\nIf anything, the new owner of a social media company should convey an inflated sense of the platform\'s worth! But Musk has at times, despite his forceful defense of free speech culture on the internet, repeated confused talking points that indicate scattered thinking while simultaneously failing to fully flesh out what day-to-day operations will look like. For example, a lot of content moderation involves the unsexy—and not very ideological—challenge of keeping spam under control. And, as Mike Masnick points out at Techdirt, Musk doesn\'t seem to have a particularly robust understanding of "hate speech" and how much of what we call hate speech is, in fact, protected by the First Amendment.\n\nA lot remains to be seen about how Twitter will change and what Musk will bring to the table. Optimism, with some reservations about Musk\'s ability to execute, seems warranted. Hysteria—like declaring that it\'s now open season for white supremacists, that Musk\'s vision for free speech will be "lethal," or that Musk is an echo of imperialist, colonizer forebears because he wants to go to Mars—is not.', 'image': 'https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2022/04/thumbnail-9-3.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:46'}

Musk paid $44 billion to acquire the social media platform with the stated aim of turning it into a haven for "free speech."\n\nThe web is awash in speculation over what that means. Conservatives and people booted off the platform have pushed for Musk to reinstate banned accounts, including that of former President Donald Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, prominent Twitter figures are now saying they\'ll leave the platform in protest of its new owner. Among them is English actress Jameela Jamil, who tweeted her fears Monday that Musk "is going to help this hell platform reach its final form of totally lawless hate, bigotry, and misogyny."\n\nIt\'s unclear whether Musk will be able to realize all his plans for Twitter. The tech leader has floated less moderation, less advertising and an open-source algorithm. But Musk\'s stated ideals contradict his own actions.\n\nWhat Musk says he wants\n\nMusk has made clear he wants less moderation — which he considers censorship — on the platform.\n\n"Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated," he said in Monday\'s announcement about the acquisition.\n\nHe also said he wants to defeat the "spambots," or automated accounts that mimic real users; open the algorithm to public inspection and "authenticate all humans" using the platform.\n\nMusk laid out a definition of speech in a TED interview last week.\n\n"A good sign as to whether there is free speech is, is someone you don\'t like allowed to say something you don\'t like? If that is the case, we have free speech," he said.\n\nMusk said Twitter would abide by national laws that restrict speech around the world. Beyond that, he said, he\'d be "very reluctant" to delete posts or permanently ban users who violate the company\'s rules.\n\nHe had previously criticized Trump\'s ban from social media in the wake of the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Twitter and Facebook permanently banned Trump\'s account on the grounds that he incited violence.\n\n"A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech," Musk tweeted days after Trump was banned from both Facebook and Twitter.\n\nHow Musk responds to disagreement\n\nMusk\'s own history, however, puts in doubt his commitment to let people he doesn\'t like speak. As the newsletter Popular Information has documented, Musk has regularly blocked users who criticize him or Tesla; threatened pro-union Tesla employees and company whistleblowers; and has aggressively gone after short-sellers and journalists who are critical of Tesla, sometimes calling their work "false" or "misleading."\n\nIn 2018, he launched a vendetta against Linette Lopez, an Insider journalist critical of Tesla, a move which writer Felix Salmon called "obsessive and deranged."\n\nMusk\'s popular tweets typically send a swarm of his social media fans directly to the accounts of reporters to harass them for hours or days.\n\nSome academics say that Musk\'s hands-off approach threatens to bring Twitter to its bad old days, when harassment and abuse were rampant.\n\n"With Musk, his posturing of free speech — just leave everything up — that would be bad in and of itself," said Paul Barrett, the deputy director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University. "If you stop moderating — with automated systems and human reviews — a site like Twitter, in the space of a short period of time, you would have a cesspool."\n\nSome former Twitter employees are also dismayed by Musk\'s successful bid for the company.\n\n"Twitter is going to let a man-child essentially take over their platform," said Leslie Miley, a former Twitter employee who has also worked for Google and Apple. Miley, who was the only Black engineer at Twitter in a leadership position when he left the company in 2015, echoed doubts shared by others about Musk\'s grasp of the platform\'s complexities.\n\n"I am not sure if Elon knows what he is getting," Miley said. "He may just find that having Twitter is a lot different than wanting Twitter."\n\nUnfettered expression does not attract advertisers\n\nA decade ago, a Twitter executive called the company "the free speech wing of the free speech party," underscoring its commitment to untrammeled freedom of expression. But the company reversed itself after reports of online abuse and harassment became frequent.\n\nIn the U.S., a visceral 2014 article by journalist Amanda Hess exposed the incessant, vile harassment many women faced just for posting on Twitter or other online forums. Twitter also learned about the consequences of an unmoderated social platform: mainly, that it undercut their funding from advertisers.\n\nAds are how Twitter makes money, and companies generally don\'t want their ads running against violent threats, hate speech that bleeds into incitement or incendiary information aimed at tipping elections or undermining public health.\n\nGoogle, Barrett pointed out, quickly learned this lesson the hard way when major companies like Toyota and Anheuser-Busch yanked their ads after they ran ahead of YouTube videos produced by extremists in 2015.\n\nOnce it was clear just how unhealthy the conversation had gotten, Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey spent years trying to improve what he called the "health" of the conversation on the platform.\n\nThe company was an early adopter of the "report abuse" button after U.K. member of parliament Stella Creasy received a barrage of rape and death threats on the platform. The online abuse was the result of a seemingly positive tweet in support of feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez, who successfully advocated for novelist Jane Austen to appear on a British banknote. Creasy\'s online harasser was sent to prison for 18 weeks.\n\nTwitter has continued to craft rules and invest in staff and technology that detected violent threats, harassment and misinformation that violated its policies. After evidence emerged that Russia used Twitter\'s platforms to try to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election, social media companies stepped up their efforts against political misinformation. All have struggled with defining "misinformation," however, and been accused of both leaving up false content as well as over-censoring legitimate posts.\n\nHard to unwind moderation\n\nThe big question now is how far Musk wants to ratchet back these systems — and whether users and advertisers will stick around if he does.\n\nLike Miley, the former Twitter engineer, experts who have studied content moderation and researched Twitter express doubt that Musk knows what he is getting into. After all, there are plenty of fledgling examples of so-called free speech-focused platforms that have been launched in the past few years as Twitter alternatives, largely by conservatives unhappy with the Twitter\'s crackdown on hate, harassment and misinformation. Many such sites have struggled to deal with toxic content, and at least one has been cut off by its own technology providers in protest.\n\n"This move just shows how effective (moderation features) have been to annoy those in power," said Kirsten Martin, a professor of technology ethics at the University of Notre Dame. "I would be worried as to how this would change Twitter\'s values."\n\nThe fact that no other bidders emerged in public before Musk\'s deal was a sign that other would-be acquirers might find Twitter too difficult to improve, said Third Bridge analyst Scott Kessler.\n\n"This platform is pretty much the same one we\'ve had over the last decade or so," Kessler said. "You\'ve had a lot of smart people trying to figure out what they should do, and they\'ve had trouble. It\'s probably going to be tough to make a lot of headway."\n\nEven now, Americans say they\'re more likely to be harassed on social media than any other online forum, with women, people of color and LGBTQ users reporting a disproportionate amount of that abuse. Roughly 80% of users believe the companies are still doing only a "fair or poor" job of handling that harassment, according to a Pew Research Center survey of U.S. adults last year.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/04/30/39aaad79-fd57-40fa-b203-bc4143cf40f2/thumbnail/1200x630g8/aef00fb0dcf931880dd52af0a50dc345/gettyimages-1206290121.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:24'}

(How fitting that it was Canadian Jim Carrey who starred in that film.)\n\nThere is something unique about Trudeau that is causing him to become “regressive” as the rest of the leftist dominated West is affording vaccine-free citizens their civil rights.\n\nTo the outside world, Trudeau may look like a confident – if not cringeworthy – tin-pot dictator, but in reality, he is a 50-year-old boy with little to no virtue. He is essentially a spoiled teenager who can remember lines and present himself well in a tailored suit and has a family name that tricked people into thinking he was competent.\n\nHis (Canadian) father, Pierre Trudeau, for all his faults, was shrewd and intelligent – even if evil. Justin Trudeau is evil and unintelligent and quite obtuse.\n\nI can’t help but think he believes he must prove himself as being his own verified dictator in order to fill his daddy’s shoes. Simply put, he is insecure and projecting.\n\n— Article continues below Petition — PETITION: Ask Elon Musk to REINSTATE LifeSite\'s Twitter accounts Show Petition Text 7936 have signed the petition.

Sign this Petition Please SIGN and SHARE this petition to the new owner of Twitter, Elon Musk, asking him to reinstate LifeSiteNews\' truth-telling Twitter accounts which have been suspended since early 2021. After contentious negotiations, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has purchased Twitter, thereby transforming the tech giant into a private company. A self-styled "free speech absolutist," Mr. Musk\'s entrepreneurial spirit may define his approach to governing Twitter, where, in the marketplace of ideas, the best ideas - not those aided by censorship - will naturally prevail among the competition. Of course, there are limits to free speech. But, for too long, Big Tech giants (including, Twitter, Google, YouTube and Facebook) have subjected their conservative and Christian users to all forms of censorship, desperately trying to silence our voices. So if, as it seems, Mr. Musk will level the playing field for conservatives and Christians and allow a true exchange of ideas to occur on his platform, then we look forward to our chance to re-engage on Twitter. Please SIGN and SHARE this petition to the new owner of Twitter, Elon Musk, asking him to reactivate LifeSiteNews\' truth-telling Twitter accounts which have been suspended since early 2021. They are: https://twitter.com/LifeSite\n\nhttps://twitter.com/LSNCatholic\n\nhttps://twitter.com/WCDM_LSN\n\nhttps://twitter.com/WCEA_LSN These accounts have been blocked by the outgoing Twitter regime for more than a year for calling a ‘transgender woman’ (Assistant Secretary of Health, \'Rachel\' Levine), a man, and for tweeting an article about the same person. The article we tweeted makes mention of the troubling paradox of having a person who denies the basic science of the human anatomy be in an authoritative position in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), but does not cast aspersions or any other such “hate speech” against Levine, according to Twitter’s "rules." It is our fervant hope that Mr. Musk intends to allow - rather than censor - our descriptions of reality as we know them to be true in regards to human sexuality, as well as in other areas of life. Mr. Musk evidently understands how significant freedom of speech is to the functioning of a free society as he was quoted as saying that this deal is important for "the future of civlization." LifeSiteNews believes that being able to spread the truth in charity is absolutely vital for the future of society, as the "truth shall make you free." (Jn 8:32) And so, in order for us to charitably spread the truth far and wide, we now seek to re-engage on Twitter\'s public square. Thank you for SIGNING and SHARING this petition to Elon Musk, urging him to now reinstate LifeSiteNews\' suspended Twitter accounts.

The New Democrats have cozied up to Trudeau in order to pretend they are a sane and legitimate party and have promised to prop up his regime. Promises don’t really mean anything when politicians make them, so we shouldn’t assume that the communists will be loyal to each other.\n\nHowever, it is obvious that public opinion is against Trudeau to a degree that he will not be able to withstand.\n\nThere is a reason why Trudeau had to resort to the Emergencies Act to squash the Freedom Convoy; no one wanted to stop it until they were forced to by law.\n\nThe various levels of provincial and municipal governance could have stopped the movement the way they stop any non-violent protest – but they didn’t want to.\n\nDoes this mean that the cops and all the citizens supported the convoy? Of course not, but I think that enough of them saw how absurd things have become and just wanted something to make the whole charade of 2020-2021-2022 go away.\n\nThe application of the Emergencies Act was wildly unpopular among Canadians, both on the Left and the Right. Leftists were happy to see the movement end but were unimpressed that Trudeau ended it in such an absurd way. Conservatives generally supported the movement, and therefore saw Trudeau as a complete lunatic for doing what he did.\n\nAll of this means that in the long run Trudeau is hurting his reputation, even among his base. This is not news for him as the Conservative leadership race heats up.\n\nFreedom is on the move\n\nWithout giving the impression that I think Canada is on the brink of some massive societal restoration, I would be remiss if I did not speak to the positives.\n\nCurrently, we are witnessing the first real Conservative leadership race in a long time. Pierre Pollievre is filling arenas and convention centres with freedom-loving crowds, and Leslyn Lewis is making leftist journalists look silly on national TV. It is worth remembering that we are talking about a leadership race, not an election, but the swell of right-wing uprising is palpable.\n\nIn fact, the last time something like this happened was after a groundswell of Christian/right-wing sentiment following years of leftist oppression under the former Trudeau and his successors.\n\nAs a result of that, we had Stephen Harper for a decade who, although not perfect, was a saint compared with Trudeau.\n\nThe economy is tanking in Canada, and goods and services are becoming prohibitively expensive for average people. Trudeau and his cronies can appeal to idealism and progressivism all they want, but even left-wingers get ticked off and want change when they are struggling to fill the tank.\n\nUltimately, Trudeau is continuing to trap vaccine-free Canadians from participating fully in society because he knows that if he pulls the plug on his last failing restriction, that his regime will go down the drain.\n\nKennedy Hall is an Ontario based journalist for LifeSiteNews.

We are open but on our conditions. At least we know what to tell him: ‘Elon, there are rules. You are welcome but these are our rules. It’s not your rules which will apply here," said Breton.\n\nMusk’s take-private deal for Twitter could transform the Tesla chief executive, who has used the platform to attack regulators and critics, into a social media baron, given that millions of people rely on the San Francisco-based platform for news. He said on Monday that “free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy” and described Twitter as “the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated”. -FT\n\nBreton\'s comments come just days after Brussels signed a major piece of legislation targeting big tech for not doing enough to police content online, which runs counter to Musk\'s plan to loosen Twitter\'s content moderation policies to match his stated "free speech absolutist" ideology that could even see the return of former President Donal Trump to the platform (despite Trump\'s insistence he won\'t be back).\n\nAccording to Breton, he\'s simply offering Musk a "reality check" over plans for less stringent moderation, as a lack of compliance risks a ban in Europe.\n\n"Anyone who wants to benefit from this market will have to fulfill our rules. The board [of Twitter] will have to make sure that if it operates in Europe it will have to fulfill the obligations, including moderation, open algorithms, freedom of speech, transparency in rules, obligations to comply with our own rules for hate speech, revenge porn [and] harassment," said Breton, adding "If [Twitter] does not comply with our law, there are sanctions — 6 per cent of the revenue and, if they continue, banned from operating in Europe."', 'image': 'https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2022-04/musk%202.jpg?itok=_6ovvCP5', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:12'}

Jody Hice (R-Ga.), in all caps. A Twitter survey by Sen. Ted Cruz asked if Musk’s purchase was a good thing, with the only options to answer being “yes” or “no, I hate free speech.” His fellow Texan, Rep. John Carter, signaled his approval with no words at all; three clapping-hands emojis were sufficient.\n\nA pot-smoking, meme-posting evangelist for electric vehicles may be an unlikely hero for conservatives. But the Tesla chief executive’s amorphous vow to restore free speech to the social media platform has resonated among Republicans, who see themselves — starting with their de facto leader, former President Trump — as unfairly targeted by Twitter’s content moderation efforts.\n\nConservatives said their euphoric outpouring was bigger than the possible return of @RealDonaldTrump and changes to Twitter’s ownership. Rather, they see Musk’s takeover as a symbolic, and cathartic, blow against Big Tech, which the right has increasingly viewed with antipathy.\n\n“There’s a gut reaction from a lot of people, going, ‘You know what, it’s about time they get their comeuppance,’ ” said Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.). “It finally feels like someone is standing up for a principle that has been going in an opposite direction lately: less free speech, less ability to express yourself — if you are a conservative.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk centered his bid for Twitter on the premise that the social media company, which he considers a “digital town square,” is too restrictive in clamping down on expression.\n\n“I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” Musk tweeted Monday morning.\n\nMusk’s own politics are idiosyncratic. He’s the foremost face of clean vehicles who called for immediately increasing oil and gas production after the Ukraine-Russia war spiked energy prices. He fled California for Texas because of high taxes but declined to weigh in on Texas’ restrictive abortion law, saying he preferred to “stay out of politics.” He has described himself as politically independent and registered to vote in California with no party preference.\n\nFor conservatives, Musk’s crusade against content restrictions has struck a chord. Roughly half of Republicans feel they cannot express themselves freely on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, according to a Morning Consult poll conducted this month, far exceeding the percentage of Democrats and independents who felt similarly.\n\nPolitics Who did Twitter ban during the Trump era, and why? Could banned Trump allies return to Twitter under Elon Musk? A look at the former president’s backers who were kicked off the social media platform.\n\n“Twitter is a platform that I and many others believe has been more aggressive in blocking Republicans and conservatives than they have toward people on the left,” said Rep. Austin Scott (R-Ga.). “I’m hoping and expecting he will undo that.”\n\nScott is not an avid Twitter user; he does not even have the app on his phone. But he did tweet a congratulatory message to Musk, adding a plea to “restore free speech and bring back President Trump!”\n\nTrump was permanently kicked off the platform on Jan. 8, 2021 — two days after a group of his supporters overran the U.S. Capitol in hopes of blocking the certification of Joe Biden’s win. Twitter imposed the ban “due to the risk of further incitement of violence.”\n\nSo far, Musk has not indicated how he’d handle the former president’s account. Trump, meanwhile, has shown no interest in rejoining the platform that helped power his political rise and gave real-time narration of his presidency.\n\n“I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,” Trump told Fox News, referring to his fledgling social media network. “I hope Elon buys Twitter, because he’ll make improvements to it, and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth.”\n\nRepublicans see Trump as just one example of Twitter’s bias. A number of high-profile conservatives have been suspended or blocked from the platform, including the account of the Babylon Bee, a satirical news website that was suspended for a tweet naming Assistant Health Secretary Rachel Levine, who is transgender, “Man of the Year.”\n\nThe account was locked as a violation of Twitter’s ban on hate speech. Seth Dillon, CEO of Babylon Bee, refused to remove the tweet, asserting that “truth is not hate speech.”\n\n“It’s completely broken,” said Harmeet Dhillon, a conservative lawyer who has sued Twitter multiple times on behalf of clients who were banned. “The company can try to affect elections, try to ban politicians from speaking ... use algorithms, enable false accounts to constantly affect what people see.”\n\nThe extent to which conservatives face bias on the platform has been fiercely examined and debated. A study this month by researchers at MIT and Yale found that Republican users tend to be suspended more often than Democrats but that conservatives are more likely to share misinformation that would provoke such suspensions.\n\nSo far, Musk has offered little explanation as to how his free speech values would play out in practice. He said on Monday that his goals include “enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots and authenticating all humans.”\n\nBut such efforts would require some attempt at regulating content, especially by verifying users. A social media network without any moderation at all could swamp the platform with all sorts of unsavory or offensive material, such as pornography or terrorist content, as well as the online abuse and harassment that are already common occurrences.\n\n“If you don’t have content moderation, you actually have less free speech. The people who are the loudest are the bullies and harassers that drive people away,” said Katie Harbath, a former Republican operative who has worked as public policy director for Facebook.\n\nDhillon, the conservative attorney based in California, said she is not hoping for Musk to completely abandon regulation.\n\n“There’s plenty of room for them to do old-school content moderation of the kind they originally did,” she said, citing as an example prohibitions on making death threats.\n\nWith Musk’s plans still unknown, Harbath, who now runs a tech policy strategy firm, said the celebratory conservatives “are making a hell of a lot of assumptions of what Elon means by all this stuff. I don’t think they should assume he is completely on their side.”\n\nRepublicans’ triumphant tone on Twitter starkly contrasted with the more muted reaction from liberal politicians. Far fewer Democratic members of Congress weighed in on Twitter, although those who did were markedly unenthused.\n\n“This deal is dangerous for our democracy. Billionaires like Elon Musk play by a different set of rules than everyone else, accumulating power for their own gain. We need a wealth tax and strong rules to hold Big Tech accountable,” said Sen.

(Patrick Pleul/Pool/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nElon Musk Reveals More Details of His Plans for Twitter After Buyout\n\nElon Musk revealed more details of what he has in mind for changes at Twitter after it was confirmed that the company had accepted his buyout offer, with the tech mogul’s plans including new features and ways to enhance trust in the platform.\n\nTwitter’s board of directors said on April 25 that it had approved Musk’s offer to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share in cash, in a deal worth around $44 billion.\n\nThe buyout represents a 38 percent premium over Twitter’s closing stock price on April 1, with Parag Agrawal, CEO of Twitter, saying in a statement that he believes the deal “is the best path forward for Twitter’s stockholders.”\n\n‘Bedrock of a Functioning Democracy’\n\nIn a statement, Musk provided some details about what kind of changes he has in mind for the social media platform, whose commitment to free speech he has repeatedly called into question.\n\n“Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,” Musk said. This dovetails with his earlier statements that Twitter functions as a “de facto town square” where important conversations should be able to take place with as few constraints as possible.\n\nMusk said Monday that Twitter has “tremendous potential” and that he wants to work with the company and its users to “unlock” and make the platform “better than ever.”\n\nHe said he plans on “enhancing” Twitter with new features, which he did not provide further details on. Musk earlier created a Twitter poll asking users if they want an edit button on the platform, suggesting that this could be one of the changes he is seeking to effect.\n\nMusk also said on Monday he wants to make the platform’s algorithms “open source to increase trust,” while “defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.”\n\nThis, too, reinforces his earlier remarks that his objective in seeking to buy Twitter and turn it into a private company was to transform it into a bastion of free speech by opening up its algorithm to public scrutiny and by making its moderation policies more transparent.\n\n‘Black Box Algorithm’\n\nA self-described “free speech absolutist,” Musk told the audience at a recent TED event in Vancouver, Canada, that Twitter should permit unconstrained expression, though it should do so in line with the law.\n\n“In my view, Twitter should match the laws of the country,” Musk said, acknowledging reasonable legal caps on free speech like direct incitement to violence or shouting “fire” in a crowded theater.\n\n“But going beyond that and having it be unclear who’s making what changes to where, having tweets mysteriously be promoted and demoted with no insight into what’s going on, having a black box algorithm promote some things and not other things, I think this can be quite dangerous,” Musk said.\n\n“My strong, intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization,” he added.\n\nErr on Side of Free Speech\n\nMusk also expressed reluctance about permanent bans of users from Twitter, preferring instead temporary “time-outs.”\n\n“I’m not saying that I have all the answers here,” Musk said at the TED talk. But I do think that we want to be just very reluctant to delete things, just be very cautious with permanent bans. Timeouts I think are better than permanent bans.”\n\nIn terms of calibrating Twitter’s moderation policies, Musk said he’d want to err on the side of free speech.\n\n“If in doubt, let the speech, let it exist,” Musk said. “If it’s a grey area, I would say let the tweet exist. But obviously in a case where there’s perhaps a lot of controversy, that you would not want to necessarily promote that tweet.”\n\n“A good sign as to whether there’s free speech is, is someone you don’t like allowed to say something you don’t like,” Musk said. “And if that is the case, then we have free speech.”\n\n‘We Are Concerned’\n\nMusk has repeatedly questioned Twitter’s commitment to free speech, after accusations that the platform suppressed some minority and politically conservative viewpoints, claims Twitter has denied.\n\nMany free speech advocates have hailed Musk’s takeover bid, while those opposed have expressed fear that fewer constraints on expression on Twitter will make it too easy to abuse the platform’s reach and power by, for example, spreading disinformation.\n\nIn a series of tweets reacting to Musk’s takeover moves, Amnesty International expressed concern about the erosion of policies meant to protect users.\n\n“We are concerned with any steps that Twitter might take to erode enforcement of the policies and mechanisms designed to protect users,” Amnesty International wrote.\n\n“The last thing we need is a Twitter that wilfully turns a blind eye to violent and abusive speech against users,” the group said.\n\nAs it was confirmed Musk would purchase Twitter, the Tesla founder urged his “worst critics” to stay on the platform.\n\n“I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” he wrote in a Twitter post.\n\nDan Ives, an analyst at investment firm Wedbush Securities, told the BBC that he expects most users will take a “wait-and-see approach” on whether they stay or leave the platform, based on the changes that take place.\n\n“Now it’s about courting new users and stopping defectors from the platform,” Ives told the outlet.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/19/article-image-cal-thomas-3-1200x804.jpeg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:50'}

This feels like the first flashback scene we see in a dystopian drama after the words “SIX MONTHS EARLIER …” Quite where we’ll be in six months’ time as far as Twitter is concerned remains tantalisingly unclear, but it seems difficult to imagine it will be either a more or less pleasant space. It’s a social media platform. I’m not sure what further evidence humanity needs before we cotton on to the idea that such a thing might be an intrinsically toxic concept. Of course, there will always be some people who think it just hasn’t been done right yet. Like communism, or a British version of The Daily Show.\n\nAnyway, if Musk’s takeover goes through, he’ll assume control of a platform where the people on the right are incredibly angry about free speech, and those on the left are incredibly angry about hate speech. Which is to say: they have so much in common. As the tech visionary Jaron Lanier has long been excellent at pointing out, the best way to keep people on platforms is to make them angry. So the platforms are designed to make them angry. You might consider the anger worth it for your version of advertising (I myself will post this column on Twitter), but even then it is a weirdly grim cost of doing business that just conceivably ought to be weighed far more carefully than it is.\n\nUnlike the UK, Musk manufactures other things besides anger, but Twitter is the platform where, in a single calendar year, his posts led to multiple lawsuits, a fall in his stock price, and a Securities and Exchange Commission settlement that resulted in his chairmanship of Tesla being forcibly ended. Yet in a move that will feel familiar to a lot of Twitter users, he has not logged off, but leaned in further. When I was a child, there was a guy called Victor Kiam who owned Remington, and he would personally feature in the firm’s electric razor adverts, going: “I liked the shaver so much, I bought the company.” It would be nice to see Musk do something similar. “I liked calling innocent people paedos so much, I bought the company.”\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the distress of Twitter users feels overplayed. Perhaps Elon embodies a kind of radical honesty and self-awareness not shared by other denizens of the site. People who seem to spend half their lives complaining about Twitter, on Twitter, seem stunned by the idea that a shitposter would ultimately buy it. Catch up! It doesn’t feel like a complete coincidence that all social media platforms are owned by men you’d run a mile from socially.\n\nMusk is one of them – a brilliant, horrid, ridiculous and very occasionally endearing grotesque. A sort of intergalactically successful Dominic Cummings. And yet, despite Elon’s give-a-toss gift for making himself what Twitter users might call the “main character”, I can’t detest him entirely. If he pulls off the radical green energy transition embodied in Tesla, or even just one of his other wildly ambitious schemes, humans might have to accept some of the shit that’s gone with it. Accept it angrily, of course – how else, we’re on a social media platform! – but accept it nonetheless. A huge number of other people in public life behave appallingly and achieve absolutely nothing but harm.\n\nBut if endlessly righteous folk balk at the mere idea of necessary evils, why do they act like their own involvement in Twitter is one? It isn’t. It’s easy to focus on the high-profile people who are always on Twitter. But the sheer numbers of highly successful, highly creative and highly interesting people in the worlds of arts, business, science and beyond who AREN’T on it should tell a much more powerful story. They are part of all kinds of era-defining creative and commercial conversations and breakthroughs – and somehow manage to do it all without lavishing half the day scrolling past a bunch of other people having a row.\n\nLanier has cast detailed doubt on whether most Twitter advocacy is even meaningfully effective, despite sometimes appearing to be so. If you spend your day caught up in online fighting, it’s preferable to tell yourself you’re involved in consciousness-raising for your cause. An alternative view is that you are simply obsessively polarising your particular debate, to the point where compromise – boring, unfashionable, yet historically always necessary – becomes a more distant possibility.\n\nMy “unpopular opinion”, in one of Twitter’s tellingly popular phrases, is that those who spend a significant amount of time arguing on it work for the platform and not for their cause. The Musk takeover at least makes it easier to see whose pocket you’re putting money into as you delude yourself you’re winning arguments. I’m certainly not saying I follow this rule, but in general I think arguing on the internet is like playing real tennis: even if you win, you’re still a twat.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5899b28a3a52d992407b1aa95d2689c2b1d4703f/0_273_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=e4d7eefe6e510bd81cf93360935a1d81', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:53'}

After news of Musk’s takeover, news website Politico contacted several top Republican members and aides to gauge reaction to a potential Trump Twitter return.\n\n“Every single one of them told us that they hoped the former president stays the hell away from Twitter,” Politico reported.\n\nTrump himself has said he won’t be back, telling Fox News: “I am going to be staying on Truth.”\n\nThe twice-impeached former commander-in-chief is not known for his consistency, however. He has reportedly expressed discontent with how Truth Social has performed – “What the fuck is going on,” the Daily Beast reported Trump as asking aides in March – and to return to relevance, and to win back the spotlight he craves, the former president might need Twitter.\n\n“If he wants to intervene on behalf of a candidate he has now endorsed in the midterm elections, being able to reach that number of people with messages supporting those candidates is a way of essentially getting free advertising time to reach people who are more likely to vote as a result of getting a signal from Donald Trump,” Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, told Time.\n\nTrump may have insisted that he will snub Twitter and stick with Truth Social, but his commitment to his own platform has so far been tepid at best – Trump has posted on Truth Social just once.\n\nIf that lack of interaction hasn’t helped Truth Social, neither did the botched rollout on 21 February. Tens of thousands of people were unable to access the network – the Guardian was finally allowed in on 5 March – and by early April the Truth Social app was the 355th most popular on Apple devices.\n\nIn terms of daily active users, Truth Social had 513,000, the Daily Beast reported. Twitter has about 217 million.\n\nLack of usage – both by Trump and by the general public – is not the only problem the new network faces.\n\nShares in Digital World Acquisition Corporation, the firm which plans to merge with Trump Media & Technology Group, dropped 13% on Monday after news of Musk’s deal. Since Musk became the largest shareholder in Twitter TMTG shares have fallen by 44% overall, and two key Truth Social executives quit the platform in April.\n\nSince Trump was removed from Twitter his missives have been limited to email blasts sent from his Save America Pac, the messages frequently bleating about a “stolen election” in 2020. At the moment those emails are received by a mixture of supporters and vaguely interested journalists.\n\nIf Trump resumed tweeting, he’d have a far bigger audience for his misinformation – which could have serious consequences.\n\n“The real danger would come after election day,” Gertz said, “when he could use that same megaphone to spread lies about voter fraud as a pretext for overturning elections. If that happens, another January 6 – perhaps a more successful one – is very much in play.”', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a92109698abfe8cebc8ed79f918f6e0cb5a652cf/0_156_5131_3078/master/5131.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0c9734ab4bdc644afa8fecabe2eaf914', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:03'}

Those measures aim to make the services more appealing to advertisers seeking a safe venue, and to better accommodate politicians and regulators arguing that the platforms are responsible for all of their content. But the moves have alienated some users who, like Mr. Musk, say they go overboard.\n\nHow Twitter operates won’t be entirely up to Mr. Musk.\n\n“Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules—regardless of their shareholding,” Thierry Breton, the EU regulator, wrote Tuesday on Twitter. “Mr Musk knows this well.”\n\nMr. Breton expressed confidence that Twitter, under Mr. Musk’s ownership, would conform to the bloc’s new rules, which still need formal approval from the EU Parliament and representatives from EU countries.\n\nMr. Musk’s planned changes at Twitter, and the response, will be closely watched. Twitter is smaller and less profitable than other social-media companies. It claims 217 million so-called monetizable daily users compared with 1.9 billion daily users for Meta Platforms Inc.’s core Facebook platform and a billion-plus monthly users for TikTok. But Twitter users include media personalities, politicians, activists and tech aficionados who help shape social discourse.\n\n“It has influence way beyond its user base and way beyond its valuation, and so we care about it,” said David Kaye, former United Nations special rapporteur focused on free speech and now a law professor at the University of California, Irvine.\n\nTwitter’s existing content policies haven’t brought about huge financial success; it has struggled to deliver consistent profits. Photo: Laura Morton for The Wall Street Journal\n\nMr. Musk, chief executive of Tesla Inc. and Space Exploration Technologies Corp. as well as the world’s richest person, is one of Twitter’s most prominent users, employing the platform for everything from promoting his companies to battling rivals and critics. In Monday’s deal announcement, he said he wants to open up Twitter’s algorithms to public scrutiny, “defeat” spammers and authenticate users’ identities.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Musk said he views “free speech” as that permitted by the law—a far broader definition of what is allowable than most major social networks have adopted. “I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law,” he said in a tweet. “If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect. Therefore, going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people.”\n\nSome industry executives and analysts say Mr. Musk is in for an awakening. Reversing Twitter’s efforts risks stoking advertisers’ worries about the placement of their ads, potentially pushing them toward competitors like Snap Inc. and Meta, said Ben Black, co-head of internet research at Deutsche Bank.\n\nElon Musk struck a deal on Monday to buy Twitter for about $44 billion, moving the world’s richest man a step closer to taking control of the social-media platform. Photo: Ryan Lash/TED Conferences, LLC/AFP via Getty Images\n\n“Do you really want to have your Mercedes-Benz commercial against a beheading?” he said. “If someone falls overboard on a cruise ship, do you want your vacation message being advertised against that content?” He said less moderation could also drive away some users, potentially slowing growth.\n\n“‘Do you really want to have your Mercedes-Benz commercial against a beheading?’” — Ben Black, co-head of internet research at Deutsche Bank\n\nIn the company’s early years, Twitter executives were loath to remove content unless it broke local laws. The platform often took a hands-off approach even to content from officially designated terrorist groups, drawing criticism from researchers, lawmakers and victims’ families.\n\nIt stepped up moderation over the years, removing accounts connected to the terrorist group ISIS in 2014, for example. That accelerated during and after the 2016 U.S. presidential race, which saw a jump in complaints about white nationalists and others using the platform to attack and harass minority users.\n\nOther industry leaders who favored looser policies, including Meta co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, have gradually embraced more intervention. Platforms including Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest Inc. and Reddit Inc. all have added staff or bolstered rules to monitor their content, though each draws the lines differently.\n\nTheir efforts target a range of potentially problematic content, from hate speech and false information about elections to what they see as fringe views on health, along with other issues the platforms consider harmful. Pinterest recently banned posts that it deems to contain misinformation about climate change.\n\nTwitter and other platforms also have systems allowing users to report claims of abuse by other users, which can lead to account suspensions that some of those involved say can be arbitrary or unfair.\n\nMore moderating has required complex, and often confusing, guidelines for employees and users. Such efforts have led to some divisive decisions, including bans by Twitter and Facebook of then-President Donald Trump for posts encouraging the rioters who attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, seeking to halt certification of President Biden’s electoral victory.\n\nThose bans were widely praised on the left and by some Republicans. But Mr. Trump and his supporters blasted it and have backed rival social-media apps with fewer restrictions that so far have gained limited traction, including Parler, Gab, and Gettr, which former Trump adviser Jason Miller launched last year.\n\nMany in the Trump camp have voiced support for Mr. Musk’s planned Twitter acquisition, though Mr. Trump told Fox News on Monday that he doesn’t plan to return to the platform and would instead use his social-media startup, Truth Social.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up Technology A weekly digest of tech reviews, headlines, columns and your questions answered by WSJ's Personal Tech gurus. PREVIEW\n\nDevin Nunes, CEO of Truth Social, lauded Monday’s Twitter deal, though he said he doesn’t see the platform, even under Mr. Musk, as a direct competitor because of their different target audiences. “This is a great, great day,” the Trump ally and former GOP congressman said. “Finally we’re getting some movement in the right direction here in terms of opening the internet back up and giving people their voice back.”\n\nTwitter’s existing policies haven’t brought about huge financial success; it has struggled to deliver consistent profits. And losing advertisers might not be a problem for Mr. Musk. He has said he wants the platform to rely less on advertising—which accounts for about 90% of its revenue, totaling $5.1 billion last year—and to focus more on a subscription business model. The platform currently offers Twitter Blue, a $2.99-a-month subscription service that gives customers access to premium features.\n\nDespite Mr. Trump’s comments Monday, many observers and Twitter employees are focused on Mr. Musk’s handling of the former president’s account as a potential indicator of his plans. During an all-hands meeting on Monday, Twitter CEO Parag Agarwal was asked if the company might reinstate Mr. Trump once Mr. Musk’s ownership is completed. Mr. Agarwal said it wasn’t clear.\n\n—Patience Haggin contributed to this article.\n\nElon Musk and Twitter More coverage of the billionaire's bid for Twitter, selected by editors Latest Developments\n\nWrite to Deepa Seetharaman at Deepa.Seetharaman@wsj.com and Meghan Bobrowsky at Meghan.Bobrowsky@wsj.com", 'image': 'https://images.wsj.net/im-531039/social', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:07'}

Carlson’s account also re-posted a comment from Charlie Kirk saying Levine spent “54 years of his life as a man.”\n\nThe move comes after tech entrepreneur Elon Musk and Twitter came to an agreement for Musk to take the company private for $44 billion on Monday.\n\n“A free Twitter would mean a direct challenge to the people in charge of our country’s institutions many of whom are incompetent,” Carlson said on his top-rated Fox News program on Monday evening. “For the first time in years we’ll be able to talk honestly about our leaders. We’ll be able to have the kind of conversations that make democracy possible.”\n\nMusk’s takeover of Twitter triggered questions about whether certain users, including former President Donald Trump, would return to the platform.

This is a point often lost on Americans. Government — or large centralized authority — is one threat to liberty but not the only one. When it comes to speech, what has often kept a great many people from speaking isn’t censorship but the lack of a platform. Social media, including Twitter, came along and promised to change that. But when it became a cesspit of hate and harassment for women and people of color in particular, it began to offer a miserable bargain: You can be free to say what you wish, but your life can be made unrelentingly painful if you so dare.\n\nThe “censorship” that Mr. Musk performatively deplores consists of efforts to rectify these very real problems of harassment and abuse. Twitter has taken modest but wildly inadequate steps to improve safety on the platform. It has acknowledged it has a problem. It has recognized positive freedom of speech — the creation of a safe and non-life-ruining environment for the airing of thoughts. And it is this that Mr. Musk and his ilk seem to loathe.\n\nThis is why his deal to purchase Twitter is so dangerous.

That’s just the first step. Then you take some of the spoils and reinvest it in buying even more political influence, so that political inequality can help keep economic inequality yawning. You buy up media or social media platforms and thus can help rig the discourse in your favor, taking control of the tools used by regular people to fight back. You venture, as Mr. Musk did, to a TED conference and, without much pushback, brand yourself as a kind of public intellectual, a thought leader, a visionary, and thereby in many people’s minds you became a sage, not a robber baron.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be this way. We can have nice things. But we’re going to have to learn to see through the fraudulent stories that elevate figures like Mr. Musk into heroes. We’re going to have to legislate real guardrails — perhaps like those created by the European Union’s Digital Services Act — on social media platforms that are too big to entrust democracy to.

Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency created as a 'joke' in 2013. Its mascot is a Shiba Inu dog, made popular from the 'doge' meme featuring photos of the canine overlaid with text written in broken English. It can be bought or sold on crypto exchanges like Coinbase or on trading apps like Robinhood and Webull. One Dogecoin is worth 16 cents as of Tuesday morning. It's never been worth more than 64 cents. Creator Billy Markus said last year that he invented the coin as a joke. 'I'm half detached, but it's weird that something I made in a few hours is now part of internet culture,' he said. 'It's amusing to see Elon Musk talk about it. It feels silly, but there's this huge upwelling behind it.'

The power of corporations to dictate policy is greatly enhanced if Twitter depends on advertising money to survive,' he added.\n\n'Maybe even an option to pay in Doge?'\n\nSome Twitter users are worried about the future of the company at the hands of Musk, who is known to use the platform to post inflammatory messages and tease his followers, sometimes with the idea of using Dogecoin legitimately.\n\nIn January, he tweeted: 'Tesla merch buyable with Dogecoin.'\n\nThe stock went up by more than 15 percent that same day, CNBC reports.\n\nLast May, Musk played a financial expert trying to explain crypto on SNL's Weekend Update segment.\n\n'They're a type of digital money but instead of being controlled by a central Government, they're decentralized using blockchain technology,' he explained, letting out a nervous giggle.\n\nIn a bit about how difficult it is to explain, the segment's host repeatedly asked him, 'What is dogecoin?'\n\n'I keep telling you, it's a cryptocurrency you can trade for conventional money.'\n\nDogecoin creator Billy Markus admitted last year that he created the coin as a joke, and that it was 'amusing' to see Elon Musk promoting it\n\n'Oh, so it's a hustle,' Michael Che finally said.\n\n'Yeah, it's a hustle,' Musk replied.\n\nThe stock dived by 22 percent while the show was airing.\n\nDogecoin creator Billy Markus told Bloomberg last year that he invented the coin as a joke.\n\nThe coin was being traded a lot early last year, reaching a high of 64 cents in May, months after amateur investors managed to send shares of video game retailer GameStop soaring.\n\nMarkus cashed in his Dogecoin and abandoned his pet project in 2015.\n\n'I'm half detached, but it's weird that something I made in a few hours is now part of internet culture,' he said.

Co-founder Jack Dorsey (right) holds a board seat, but is expected to give it up in May\n\nMusk is known for using Twitter to post inflammatory messages, much like former President Donald Trump.\n\nParag Agrawal, the CEO, said on Monday that it was up to Musk to decide whether to readmit Trump.\n\nTrump on Monday said he would not be rejoining the site if Musk allowed him to - instead saying he would continue to use his own TRUTH Social.\n\nSome experts are pointing to a tough road ahead for Twitter if Musk, who calls himself a free speech absolutist, gets his way.\n\n'We expect advertisers will be less willing to spend on Twitter if Elon Musk removes content moderation in order to promote free speech,' MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson said.\n\nThe 16-year old company, which has emerged as one of the world's most influential online public squares with about over 200 million users, reported $4.51 billion in ad revenue for 2021, accounting for about 89% of its overall sales.\n\n'The challenge (for Twitter) will be maintaining and building revenue given that the controversial opinions (Musk) hopes to give more of a free rein to are often unpalatable to advertisers,' Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Susannah Streeter said.\n\nTesla tycoon versus Big Tech: How swashbuckling billionaire Elon Musk fought off 'poison pill', lawsuits and hostile board of directors before $44bn Twitter takeover\n\nIt has been one of the most dramatic takeover attempts in history, seeing a swashbuckling billionaire pitted against one of the largest tech giants in the world.\n\nBut Elon Musk's seizing of Twitter has been a months-long pursuit that has seen him send shockwaves through the world of business.\n\nThe Tesla magnate started hoarding shares in the social media firm at the start of the year in an apparent bid to preserve free speech online.\n\nHe quickly rocketed to the top of its shareholders' list, acquiring a huge 9% stake in the tech giant.\n\nBut then he hit choppy waters, accepting a place on the board then rejecting it, getting embroiled in lawsuits and seeing rival companies circle to buy Twitter.\n\nMeanwhile bosses at the social media firm appeared to do all they could to ensure he could not not seize it - even launching a 'poison pill' strategy to sink his chances.\n\nYet Musk brazenly blasted through all the obstacles, punting a $43 billion offer earlier this month and showing how he would finance it.\n\nThe two sides were reportedly working into the early morning on Monday to finalize the 'fast-moving' negotiations.\n\nIt saw Twitter shares in the US soar by four percent as the markets opened to $50.84 a share.\n\nOn Monday, Musk called for his 'worst critics' to remain on the platform because 'that is what free speech means'.\n\nHere, DailyMail.com looks at the rollercoaster journey he has been on over the last few months as he seizes his prize.\n\n\n\nThe Tesla magnate started hoarding shares in the social media firm at the start of the year in an apparent bid to preserve free speech online\n\nJanuary 31: Musk hoards Twitter shares and buys them 'almost daily'\n\nMusk started buying Twitter stock on January 31 and continued to buy shares during every trading session through April 1, according to an SEC filing.\n\nJust days earlier, he told his 80 million followers on the site he was ' giving serious thought ' to creating his own social media platform.\n\nA user asked him: 'Would you consider building a new social media platform, @elonmusk?\n\n'One that would consist an open source algorithm, one where free speech and adhering to free speech is given top priority, one where propaganda is very minimal. I think that kind of a platform is needed.'\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO replied through his official account: 'Am giving serious thought to this.'\n\nThe billionaire businessman, 50, appeared to be suggesting he was sick of Twitter over the right to freedom of speech.\n\nApril 4: Musk says he bought 9.2 percent stake in firm a month earlier\n\nMusk revealed he had purchased a 9.2 percent stake in the social media giant on March 14.\n\nHe tweeted 'oh hi lol' after the news sent shockwaves through the business world and across social media. He added: 'Do you want an edit button?'\n\nApril 5: He joins Twitter's board of directors - sees share price rocket\n\nTwitter said the tech tycoon was joining the company's board of directors, causing the social media platform's shares to rise over 7 per cent in premarket trading.\n\nIt led to speculation he would try to address what he called the platform's 'failure to adhere to free speech principles' and 'fundamentally undermine democracy'.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Musk would have served on the board until the company's 2024 annual shareholders meeting.\n\nAs long as he remains a director, the agreement said, he could not won more than 14.9 percent of the company's stock.\n\nIt meant he would not have been able to take over the company until well after his term on the board was over.\n\nThe firm said: 'Twitter is committed to impartiality in the development and enforcement of its policies and rules.\n\n'Our policy decisions are not determined by the Board or shareholders, and we have no plans to reverse any policy decisions.'\n\n'As always our Board plays an important advisory and feedback role across the entirety of our service.\n\n'Our day to day operations and decisions are made by Twitter management and employees.'\n\nApril 8: Asset managers take over Musk as largest shareholders\n\nAsset manager Vanguard Group increased its stake to overtake Musk as the largest shareholder.\n\nVanguard owned 10.3 percent of Twitter, while the Tesla tycoon owned 9.1 per cent, making him the largest individual shareholder.\n\nVanguard, led by CEO Tim Buckley, increased its stake in the company at some point during the first quarter, according to SEC filings made on April 8.\n\nIt previously reported owning 67.2million shares of Twitter or about 8.4 per cent of the company as of the end of December, according to FactSet.\n\nOther owners of large quantities of Twitter stock included Morgan Stanley, Fidelity and Black Rock.\n\nVanguard, led by CEO Tim Buckley, increased its stake in the company at some point during the first quarter, according to SEC filings made on April 8\n\nApril 9: Musk rejects the offer to join Twitter's board of directors\n\nMusk rejected an offer to join Twitter's board after disclosing his stake in the company.\n\nAnalysts said the move signaled his intention to take over the company as a board seat would have limited his stake to just under 15 per cent.\n\nParag Agrawal said the board would still 'remain open' to Musk's input, but warned: 'There will be distractions ahead but our goals and priorities remain unchanged.'\n\nHe said: 'The board and I had many discussions about Elon joining the board, and with Elon directly. We were excited to collaborate and clear about the risks.\n\n'We also believed that having Elon as a fiduciary of the company where he, like all board members, has to act in the best interests of the company and all our shareholders, was the best path forward. The board offered him a seat.'\n\nAgrawal continued: 'We announced on Tuesday that Elon would be appointed to the board contingent on a background check and formal acceptance.\n\n'Elon's appointment to the board was to become officially effective 4/9, but Elon shared that same morning that he will no longer be joining the board.'\n\nParag Agrawal said the board would still 'remain open' to Musk's input, but warned: 'There will be distractions ahead but our goals and priorities remain unchanged'\n\nApril 12: Twitter shareholder Marc Bain Rasella files suit against Musk\n\nMarc Bain Rasella filed a lawsuit against Musk for alleged securities fraud at a Manhattan federal court, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nThe suit claimed the billionaire was required to disclose his holdings to the SEC by March 24, but the delay kept Twitter's share price down allowing Musk to buy more.\n\nMusk was accused of violating a regulatory deadline to reveal he had accumulated a stake of at least five per cent.\n\nInstead, according to the complaint, Musk did not disclose his position in Twitter until he had almost doubled his stake to more than nine per cent.\n\nThat strategy, the lawsuit alleges, hurt less wealthy investors who sold shares in the company in the nearly two weeks before Musk acknowledged holding a major stake.\n\nApril 14: The Tesla tycoon offers to buy Twitter for $43 BILLION\n\nMusk offered to buy Twitter for $43billion, a regulatory filing showed, as he moved to seize the social media giant.\n\nMusk's offer price of $54.20 per share represented a 38 per cent premium to the closing price of Twitter's stock on April 1.\n\nThis was the last trading day before the Tesla CEO's over nine per cent investment in the company was publicly announced.\n\nIt even appeared to reference marijuana - also known as 420 - a common reference used by Musk on Twitter.\n\nTwitter said in a regulatory filing Musk provided a letter containing a proposal to buy the remaining shares of Twitter he did not already own.\n\nApril 15: Twitter launches 'poison pill' strategy to stop Musk buyout\n\nTwitter's board announced a dramatic poison pill plan to prevent Musk from increasing his stake in the company.\n\nAlso known as a shareholder rights provision, the plan would trigger a dilution of shares if any shareholder builds up a 15 per cent stake without the board's approval.\n\nThe plan did not prevent Twitter from accepting Musk's offer or entering negotiations with him or other potential buyers.\n\nBut it did stop the billionaire from putting pressure on the board by buying up ever more shares on the open market.\n\nMusk hit back with a laughing emoji to a version of the classic 'Distracted Boyfriend' meme mocking Twitter's board.\n\nThe imaged depicted 'Twitter's board' looking wistfully at the option to 'keep that easy gig that gives me shares' as 'Twitter investors' look on with disgust.\n\nTwitter's board is led by chairman Bret Taylor, who is also the co-CEO of business software giant Salesforce\n\nApril 16: Musk tweets Love Me Tender in tease of hostile takeover\n\nMusk tweeted 'Love Me Tender' as he again teased at the possibility of a hostile takeover of Twitter.\n\nThe billionaire posted the Elvis Presley lyrics in a potential bid to lure shareholders with a tender offer that could see him seize control.\n\nA tender offer would see him bypass the board and go to shareholders with his offer of $54.20 a share - but he would need to show how he would finance his bid.\n\nHe also appeared to suggest he would strip board members of their salaries, saying they would get '$0 if my bid succeeds'.\n\nApril 18: Jack Dorsey slams the Twitter board for 'plots and coups'\n\nJack Dorsey slammed the board of Twitter as he weighed into the toxic fight over Elon Musk's attempted hostile takeover for the first time.\n\nThe former CEO, who is still a member of the board himself, blasted the 'plots and coups' that were 'consistently the dysfunction of the company'.\n\nIn a series of bombshell tweets and replies, he endorsed one posting saying that 'a bad board will kill a company every time'.\n\nReplying to one post, he said: 'When I was fired in 2008 and made chair, the board took most of my shares away from me.\n\n'I also gave 1 per cent of the company back to the employee pool in 2015. So, ended up with very little of company.'\n\nHe also replied to one comment mentioning 'plots and coups' in the Twitter board saying: 'it's consistently been the dysfunction of the company'.\n\nEarlier in the thread, he replied to a post quoting a 'Silicon Valley proverb' by venture capitalist Fred Destin.\n\nIt said: 'Good boards don't create good companies, but a bad board will kill a company every time.' Dorsey said: 'Big facts.'\n\nFormer CEO Dorsey slammed Twitter's board of directors on as he replied to a series of unfriendly tweets\n\nApril 21: SpaceX boss unveils his $46.5billion financing package\n\nElon Musk unveiled his $46.5billion financing package to fund his takeover of Twitter - using Tesla as collateral.\n\nThe world's richest man filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission outlining how he would seize the social media giant.\n\nHe committed $21billion in equity, $13billion from Morgan Stanley in debt facilities and another $12.5billion from the bank and others in margin loans.\n\nBut 'a portion' of his shares in Tesla have been put forward as collateral, which analysts feared could have a huge impact on the firm.\n\nThe 50-year-old billionaire also revealed he was weighing up launching a tender offer for Twitter after the company ignored his acquisition offer.\n\nHe said he was exploring getting stocks directly from shareholders but admitted he 'has not determined whether to do so at this time'.\n\nMusk filed the document with the SEC showing how he planned to take over Twitter for about $46.5billion.\n\nHe secured a debt commitment letter from Morgan Stanley Senior Funding to the tune of $13billion in financing.\n\nThis was made up of a loan of $6.5billion, a senior secured revolving facility for $500million, a bridge loan of up to $3billion and an unsecured bridge loan for up to $3billion.\n\nHe also got a margin loan commitment letter from Morgan Stanley for $12.5 billion in margin loans. And Musk also got $21billion through equity financing.\n\nBut he has used 'a portion' of his shares in Tesla as collateral in the high-stakes move, which analysts warned could have huge ramifications for the company.\n\nApril 22: Musk posts 'boner' killer picture of Bill Gates on Twitter\n\nMusk dissed Bill Gates' gut on Twitter, posting a photo of the Microsoft mogul next to Apple's controversial pregnant man emoji 'in case you need to lose a boner.'\n\nHe posted a follow-up image in response to the Friday post of six hooded figured captioned 'shadow ban council reviewing Tweet'.\n\nThe joke could further infuriate woke Twitter staffers angered by Musk's ongoing bid to buy the firm after saying he would support free speech.\n\nThat is because the pregnant man emoji is aimed at being inclusive to transgender people - with Musk frequently taking aim at what he sees as woke overreach.\n\nApril 25: Musk finalizes deal to buy Twitter\n\nMusk was closing in on seizing Twitter as talks between the Tesla magnate and the tech giant entered their final stages, reports say.\n\nThe tycoon's representatives were said to be hammering out terms including a timeline and fees if an agreement was signed and then fell apart.\n\nThe two sides were reportedly working into the early morning to finalize the 'fluid and fast-moving' negotiations.\n\nTwitter shares soared by four percent as the markets opened to $50.84 a share amid reports it would be seized by Musk.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Twitter announced it had 'entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by an entity wholly owned by Elon Musk, for $54.20 per share in cash in a transaction valued at approximately $44 billion. Upon completion of the transaction, Twitter will become a privately held company.'", 'image': 'https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/26/14/57069119-0-image-a-49_1650980561815.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:46'}

TWTR -3.91% will need to follow the bloc’s new rules for tackling illegal and harmful content online if it wants to keep operating there, marking a possible challenge to Elon Musk’s plans to take a more hands-off approach to content moderation.\n\nThierry Breton, EU internal market commissioner, said Tuesday in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that it’s his job to make sure companies, including Twitter, understand their obligations in Europe. That will soon include a series of new obligations for social media and other online platforms, called the Digital Services Act, after lawmakers agreed to the main points of the legislation last week.\n\n“Now we have very clear rules,” Mr. Breton said. “They can do whatever they want outside of Europe…but in Europe they will just have to fulfill [our] rules and obligations.”\n\nThe Digital Services Act aims to force platforms to take more responsibility for the content their users post online. It will introduce a series of obligations for large social-media networks like Twitter, ranging from new standards for taking down illegal content to a requirement to conduct annual risk assessments detailing how they are responding to harmful content that is posted online.\n\nTwitter will become a private company if Elon Musk’s $44 billion takeover bid is approved. The move would allow Musk to make changes to the site. WSJ’s Dan Gallagher explains Musk’s proposed changes and the challenges he might face enacting them.

While there are questions about whether the European Commission will have the resources to fully enforce the new law, Prof. Tobias said, “I do think [Mr. Musk] is on notice, and Twitter shareholders, too.”\n\nMr. Musk wrote on Twitter Tuesday afternoon that his view of free speech is speech that “matches the law.”\n\n“I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law,” he said. “If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect.”\n\nMr. Breton said the EU was careful in setting its regulations to maintain freedom of speech. He said he had interactions with many platforms during the lawmaking process and was open to meeting with others, in a comment that appeared to be aimed at Mr. Musk. “If any new shareholder of these platforms is willing to engage with me, my door will be totally open, like always,” he said.\n\nThe EU’s new legislation won’t prevent Mr. Musk from taking a more free-speech-oriented approach, said Zach Meyers, a senior research fellow with the Centre for European Reform think tank.

In the wake of this "great deplatforming," Republicans\' longstanding gripes with these platforms became a legislative priority.\n\nOne of the most aggressive of these Republican-led efforts to regulate social media is Texas\' H.B. 20. Ostensibly passed to combat the "dangerous movement by social media companies to silence conservative viewpoints and ideas," this bill prohibits social media platforms from removing users or content "based on the viewpoint" of the user or content. In its effort to protect conservative speech, Texas Republicans have adopted a historically discredited left-wing legal theory, dispensing with core conservative values in the process.\n\nIn the 1960s, a group of progressive scholars argued that the First Amendment does not merely prohibit the government from censoring private speech and press. In fact, they argued, it granted the government the affirmative power to control the mass media. In a capitalist system, they reasoned, the government must ensure that private media owners do not exclude unwelcome viewpoints, in order to protect the "democratic interest" in free speech. To this end, the scholars championed the Fairness Doctrine, right-of-reply mandates, and expansive applications of "common carriage" doctrine, which enable the government to force the inclusion of certain content.\n\nBorrowing from the same playbook, Texas now argues that First Amendment values require, rather than prohibit, government interference with private speech. H.B. 20 declares that social media platforms are common carriers like telephone companies and thus are subject to onerous restrictions over who and what they may host. According to Texas, H.B. 20 serves the democratic interest in protecting the free exchange of ideas and information. But like the collectivist efforts that preceded it, Texas\' misguided attempt to advance "First Amendment rights in the Lone Star State" violates private platforms\' First Amendment rights to choose what speech they publish.\n\nAs we explained in a recently filed amicus curiae brief on behalf of the Cato Institute, courts have repeatedly rejected such regulations, and for good reasons.\n\nFirst, as a federal district court correctly noted last year, the First Amendment protects social media platforms\' discretion to publish or remove content. The Supreme Court established this right in the 1974 case Miami Herald Publishing Company v. Tornillo, when it struck down a Florida law that forced newspapers to print responses to their criticism of political candidates. The Court explained that this "right-of-reply" law infringed on newspapers\' right to choose what content they publish.\n\nThe Supreme Court affirmed that First Amendment rights apply with full force to internet media in 1997\'s Reno v. ACLU. Other federal courts have since upheld the editorial rights of search engines and social media sites. These precedents doom the Texas law. The state can\'t eviscerate platforms\' well-established First Amendment rights by arbitrarily calling them common carriers.\n\nSecond, efforts like H.B. 20 chill, rather than encourage, the exercise of free speech. Both the Florida right-of-reply law and the Fairness Doctrine actually discouraged the media from covering controversial topics that would trigger the forced-hosting requirements. Likewise, H.B. 20 will encourage platforms to ban entire subjects (say, discussions of terrorism) to avoid facing the unappetizing choice to either host objectionable viewpoints (such as pro-terrorism material) or face liability for removing each piece of content.\n\nThird, H.B. 20 violates fundamental property rights by forcing private platforms to host users and content they would otherwise exclude. The First Amendment does not authorize the government to co-opt private property to amplify certain viewpoints.\n\nThe supporters of the Texas law, like other conservative opponents of Big Tech, cite anecdotal accounts of inconsistent content moderation to support their claim of unfair bias. But it\'s more likely that these incidents are just casualties of the margin of error inherent in content moderation at scale. "Incorrect" removals of content happen millions of times per day to users representing every conceivable ideology. Conservatives are removed from platforms when they violate platforms\' terms of service, but Texas\' premise that conservatives are being unfairly targeted is unsubstantiated.\n\nBut even if it was substantiated, forced-hosting laws like H.B. 20 would contravene limited government, constitutional fidelity, and strong property rights, all of which are supposed to be core conservative values. If Texas Republicans really want to protect "conservative viewpoints," they should reacquaint themselves with those principles and reject giving the government more control over social media.', 'image': 'https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2022/04/timothy-hales-bennett-OwvRB-M3GwE-unsplash-scaled.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:31'}

In today’s world, a small handful of private tech companies — including Twitter — play a profound and unique role in enabling our right to express ourselves online. Social media is a critical tool used to share ideas, express opinions, and consume information that has real-life impacts in discourse in the offline world. We should be worried about any powerful central actor, whether it’s a government or any wealthy individual — even if it’s an ACLU member — having so much control over the boundaries of our political speech online.\n\nMusk has stated his intention to take Twitter private, to make its algorithms public, and has made several comments about the platform being necessary to Democracy and freedom of speech.\n\nHave a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com', 'image': 'https://www.mediaite.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/104579476-GettyImages-489769566.1910x1000-e1612198942847.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:48'}

It is a reminder why we need a wealth tax and why we need some serious regulation for Big Tech. One billionaire should not be able to turn the world upside down just because he plays by a different set of rules,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who believes the government should break up Big Tech companies to promote more competition.\n\nAsked whether Musk’s acquisition of Twitter was cause for concern, Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said: “Absolutely it does.”\n\n“He said he wants to make it this global message board. My first question to him, ‘Is your message board going to include Donald Trump?’ ” he said. “That’s a key question. If he lets that man rant and rave on Twitter, not in the best interests of America’s’ future.”\n\nDurbin, who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee, noted that his and other panels are exploring whether it would be appropriate to impose new regulations on Big Tech companies to incentivize them to do more to moderate content.\n\nSpeaking at Stanford last week, Obama said tech firms “need to be more transparent about how they operate” and crack down on “lies and conspiracy theories” that threaten the nation’s democratic system.\n\n“Without some standards, implications of this technology — for our elections, for our legal system, for our democracy, for rules of evidence, for our entire social order — are frightening and profound,” he warned.\n\nMusk hasn’t said whether he’ll let Trump, who was permanently barred from Twitter in January 2021, back on the platform, but his recent comments have fueled speculation that he might do so. Trump has indicated he’s not interested in getting back on Twitter, though he is known for changing his mind.\n\nSen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he also had concerns about what Musk’s purchase of Twitter might mean for the platform’s content standards.\n\nHe said he was looking into the matter but declined to provide any detail.\n\n“I’ve got some concerns. I think it will have to go through … some level of appropriate regulatory [review], and I’m doing some of my own checking,” he said.\n\nSen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) said Musk’s control over a major forum for political debate is alarming.\n\n“It’s always a concern when an oligarch may be owning the town square. I think we do need to pay a lot of attention to how it’s managed,” he said.\n\nMusk’s takeover of Twitter raises questions about what it means for his settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over fraud charges stemming from his August 2018 tweet that he had secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 per share, which pushed the car company’s stock higher.\n\nUnder the settlement, Musk must allow a Tesla lawyer to review any tweets containing material business information before hitting the send button.\n\nSen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), the chairwoman of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, said allowing Trump back on Twitter would be a major problem.\n\n“I think that’s very problematic,” she said of Trump’s possible return. “I don’t think that somebody who encouraged and organized a violent insurrection to take over our government should be allowed on Twitter.”\n\nAsked about the loosening of content standards, she said she “would certainly have concerns” but added she hadn’t looked at the deal closely enough to “get into a big analysis.”\n\nTrump, who has launched a social media venture that includes a platform intended to vie with Twitter, told Fox News on Monday that he doesn’t plan to return to Twitter.\n\n“I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,” he said, referring to his Truth Social messaging platform, before the deal was announced. “I hope Elon buys Twitter because he’ll make improvements to it and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth. The bottom line is, no, I am not going back to Twitter.”\n\nTwitter permanently suspended Trump because of what it called “the risk of further incitement of violence” after a mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to halt the certification of President Biden’s victory.\n\nTwitter later unveiled a civic integrity policy that prohibited the use of its services for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes. It also reserved the right to flag or reduce the visibility of tweets containing false or misleading information about civic processes.\n\nAt a TED conference this month, Musk stressed the importance of allowing free speech on Twitter.\n\n“Twitter has become kind of the de facto town square, so it’s just really important that people have both the reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely within the bounds of the law,” he said.\n\nConservatives on Monday applauded Musk’s move.\n\n“Elon Musk did his part for free speech today. Let’s hope the Supreme Court does as well,” former Rep. Mark Walker (N.C.), a conservative Republican running for Senate, tweeted Monday afternoon.\n\nDemocrats are worried what that means for policing claims that Biden stole the 2020 presidential election or misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n“I’m a big free speech guy, but this stuff isn’t working. It’s terrorizing democracy, and from that perspective I think it’s bad for Democrats in this sense: These Republican alt groups tend to dominate. They tend to have much more of a footprint on these social media platforms than Democrats do,” said Steve Jarding, a Democratic strategist and former senior adviser to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\nJarding is also the communications director for a new social media platform called Pixstory, which has a business model designed to root out hate and misinformation by giving integrity scores to people who post on the site.\n\nBut Jarding called it “a horrible problem” that the world’s richest person is taking over a major means of political discourse at a time when Democrats are discussing proposals to tax the unrealized capital gains of multibillionaires such as Musk to pay for proposals to fight climate change and economic inequality.\n\n“He could turn it into anything that he wants. He controls literally hundreds of millions of hits, if you will, or clicks on a platform that he can determine whether it’s used in a good way or a bad way, and that’s too much concentration with one individual,” Jarding added.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/stabenowdebbie_020922arl.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:10'}

As YouTube celebrates its 17th birthday, the game-changing user-generated video platform once known for funny pet videos and other benign content continues to attract criticism for its alleged role in fostering extremism. Ample evidence casts doubt on the idea that social media platforms are radicalizing American youth, but high-profile anecdotes about bad turns allegedly inspired by YouTube, Facebook, and other sites make it hard to combat such claims. Now one such story may come before the Supreme Court—and threaten a foundational internet speech law.\n\nThe case (Gonzalez v. Google LLC) involves a man whose daughter was killed in a 2015 ISIS attack in Paris. The grieving father, Reynaldo Gonzalez, sued YouTube\'s parent company, Google, under the U.S. Anti-Terrorism Act. Gonzalez claims that ISIS posted recruitment videos on YouTube, that YouTube recommended these videos to users, and that this led to his daughter\'s death.\n\nGonzalez\'s circumstances are tragic, but his claim is convoluted and patently illogical. To buy it, you have to buy the idea that without YouTube, the terrorist group not only would be unable to recruit members but would cease to use existing networks to carry out attacks.\n\nThe Supreme Court has not yet decided whether it will hear Gonzalez\'s case. But if it does, it could give the Court a chance to consider the parameters of Section 230, the federal law preventing internet companies and users from being liable for all third-party speech (and pretty much the backbone of the internet as we know it).\n\nSCOTUSblog notes that in 2020, Justice Clarence Thomas suggested that "in an appropriate case, we should consider whether the text of this increasingly important statute aligns with the current state of immunity enjoyed by Internet platforms." (Thomas made a similar suggestion earlier this year.)\n\n"The petition in Gonzalez v. Google LLC tries to present itself as the case Thomas has been looking for," writes Andrew Hamm:\n\nThe district court dismissed Gonzalez\'s claim on the ground that Section 230 nonetheless protected Google for its recommendations because ISIS produced the videos, not Google. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit affirmed, concluding that Section 230 protects such recommendations, at least if the provider\'s algorithm treated content on its website similarly. However, the panel in Gonzalez considered itself bound to reach this result because of a recent case on the same issue that another 9th Circuit panel decided while Gonzalez was pending. The Gonzalez panel further concluded that, if it could resolve the question itself, Section 230 would not protect a provider\'s content recommendations. Gonzalez admits that the circuits to face this question are not split. Instead, Gonzalez suggests that, had his case simply come out before the other 9th Circuit decision, then Google would be the one seeking review. Regardless, he maintains, the providers\' financial dependence on advertisements and hence on algorithms that can target users makes this question of recommendations important to resolve.\n\nGonzalez is far from the first person to sue social media companies over terrorist acts. But these people "have yet to talk a court into agreeing with their arguments," as Tim Cushing noted at Techdirt last fall.\n\n"The facts in these cases are invariably awful: often people have been brutally killed and their loved ones are seeking redress for their loss. There is a natural, and perfectly reasonable, temptation to give them some sort of remedy from someone, but as we argued in our brief, that someone cannot be an internet platform," wrote constitutional lawyer Cathy Gellis in 2017:\n\nThere are several reasons for this, including some that have nothing to do with Section 230. For instance, even if Section 230 did not exist and platforms could be liable for the harms resulting from their users\' use of their services, for them to be liable there would have to be a clear connection between the use of the platform and the harm.\n\nSection 230 "should prevent a court from ever even reaching the tort law analysis," added Gellis. "With Section 230, a platform should never find itself having to defend against liability for harm that may have resulted from how people used it."\n\nA new study backs up what advocates for Section 230 have been saying for a long time: The law protects small companies and creators more than big tech giants.\n\n"If you understand the mechanisms by which Section 230 actually works, the key is that it gets frivolous and wasteful lawsuits kicked out of court much earlier—when the costs are still intense, but more bearable," points out Mike Masnick in a Techdirt post about the study. "Without Section 230, the end result of the court case may be the same—where the company wins—but the costs would be much, much higher. For Facebook and Google that\'s not going to make a huge difference. But for smaller companies, it can be the difference between life and death."\n\n"Larger enterprises are less impacted by lawsuits," point out the authors of the study, in a report titled "Understanding Section 230 & the Impact of Litigation on Small Providers." A large company "may already have: 1) lawyers ready to deal with lawsuits (allowing the business to continue with minimal disruption); 2) insurance coverage that can offset the cost of a defense, a settlement, or a damage award; and 3) sufficient revenue and cash reserves such that most cases are viewed as a cost of doing business rather than a cataclysmic event."\n\nSmall companies are less likely to have or be able to afford any of these things, making it less likely that they will fight even lawsuits that they would win.\n\nPoliticians, alas, have taken to scapegoating Section 230 for basically anything they or their constituents don\'t like about the internet. And lawyers keep getting creative in their anti–Section 230 arguments, suggesting that while Section 230 may broadly protect internet platforms from liability for many things that users post, the law does not covers various facets of these platforms—their design, their algorithms, etc..\n\nOccasionally, judges appear sympathetic to this. In Taamneh v. Twitter, which the 9th Circuit ruled on last year, Judge Marsha Berzon wrote that Section 230 protects "only traditional activities of publication and distribution—such as deciding whether to publish, withdraw, or alter content—and does not include activities that promote or recommend content or connect content users to each other. I urge this Court to reconsider our precedent en banc to the extent that it holds that section 230 extends to the use of machine-learning algorithms to recommend content and connections to users."\n\n"This is a really weird, really dangerous place to start drawing the line in Section 230 lawsuits," wrote Tim Cushing last summer. "Algorithms react to input from users. If YouTube can\'t be held directly responsible for videos uploaded by users, it makes sense it would be immunized against algorithmically suggesting content based on users\' actions and preferences. The algorithm does next to nothing on its own without input from content viewers. It takes a user to really get it moving."\n\nFREE MINDS\n\nA federal appeals court has rejected a university\'s ban on "discriminatory harassment." The University of Central Florida\'s "discriminatory harassment" ban likely violates the First Amendment, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals said. The case is Speech First, Inc. v. Cartwright, and you can read the whole ruling here. In essence, the court found the school\'s policy against allegedly discriminatory speech to be too broad:\n\n[T]he policy (1) prohibits a wide range of "verbal, physical, electronic, and other" expression concerning any of (depending on how you count) some 25 or so characteristics; (2) states that prohibited speech "may take many forms, including verbal acts, name-calling, graphic or written statements" and even "other conduct that may be humiliating"; (3) employs a gestaltish "totality of known circumstances" approach to determine whether particular speech, for instance, "unreasonably alters" another student\'s educational experience; and (4) reaches not only a student\'s own speech, but also her conduct "encouraging," "condoning," or "failing to intervene" to stop another student\'s speech. The policy, in short, is staggeringly broad, and any number of statements—some of which are undoubtedly protected by the First Amendment—could qualify for prohibition under its sweeping standards. To take a few obvious examples, the policy targets "verbal, physical, electronic or other conduct" based on "race," "ethnicity," "religion [or] non-religion," "sex," and "political affiliation." Among the views that Speech First\'s members have said they want to advocate are that "abortion is immoral," that the government "should not be able to force religious organizations to recognize marriages with which they disagree," that "affirmative action is deeply unfair," that "a man cannot become a woman because he \'feels\' like one," that "illegal immigration is dangerous," and that "the Palestinian movement is anti-Semitic."\n\nIn a concurring opinion, Judge Stanley Marcus warned against "the grave peril posed by a policy that effectively polices adherence to intellectual dogma."\n\n"History provides us with ample warning of those times and places when colleges and universities have stopped pursuing truth and have instead turned themselves into cathedrals for the worship of certain dogma," wrote Marcus. "By depriving itself of academic institutions that pursue truth over any other concern, a society risks falling into the abyss of ignorance. Humans are not smart enough to have ideas that lie beyond challenge and debate."\n\nThe Volokh Conspiracy has more on the ruling (which includes the lovely line "the state is a really big boy") here.\n\nFREE MARKETS\n\nPrivate space mission on its way back to earth. The first privately-funded trip to the International Space Station started its return trip yesterday. More from CNN:\n\nThe mission, called AX-1, was brokered by the Houston, Texas-based startup Axiom Space, which books rocket rides, provides all the necessary training, and coordinates flights to the ISS for anyone who can afford it. The four crew members—Michael López-Alegría, a former NASA astronaut-turned-Axiom employee who is commanding the mission; Israeli businessman Eytan Stibbe; Canadian investor Mark Pathy; and Ohio-based real estate magnate Larry Connor—left the space station aboard their SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule on Sunday at 9:10 pm EST….They will spend about one day free flying through orbit before plummeting back into the atmosphere and parachuting to a splashdown landing off the coast of Florida around 1 pm ET Monday. AX-1, which launched on April 8, was originally billed as a 10-day mission, but delays extended the mission by about a week.\n\nThis isn\'t the first time private citizens have been able to pay for seats on spacecraft. "But AX-1 is the first mission with a crew entirely comprised of private citizens with no active members of a government astronaut corps accompanying them in the capsule during the trip to and from the ISS," reports CNN. "It\'s also the first time private citizens have traveled to the ISS on a US-made spacecraft."\n\nAnd it\'s also a powerful reminder that perhaps the next era of space exploration needn\'t be government funded and managed.\n\nQUICK HITS\n\n• Air Force Major General William T.

For one thing, Twitter is a private company, rather than a genuinely public space, which means that it is not bound by the First Amendment. Unlike the actual town square, Twitter retains the right to punish users for perfectly legal speech. It\'s also the case that while Twitter is incredibly important for the political class, journalists, business leaders, and other social influencers, it\'s not nearly as big or as frequently visited as Facebook, YouTube, or TikTok. As Techdirt\'s Mike Masnick put it, the entire internet is really the town square; Twitter is one small space that\'s part of it.\n\nTwitter\'s social importance is inflated by media and political figures because the site is their preferred virtual meeting ground. This is true of Musk himself; he clearly enjoys the platform, and uses it to great effect, and thus may be overstating its importance to society. But there are many others ways to communicate political messages, and if Twitter ceased to exist tomorrow, it\'s doubtful that anyone\'s ability to speak would be irreparably harmed.\n\nAdmittedly, the people really overstating Twitter\'s importance are actually Musk\'s critics in progressive and mainstream media. And boy are they overstating it: Current Affairs Editor in Chief Nathan Robinson fretted that "the only comforting reason to think [former President] Donald Trump might not win in 2024 is that his prior success was so dependent on his Twitter account. If Musk takes over it\'s very likely that Trump will be back and therefore unstoppable."\n\nThe only comforting reason to think Donald Trump might not win in 2024 is that his prior success was so dependent on his Twitter account. If Musk takes over it\'s very likely that Trump will be back and therefore unstoppable. — Nathan J Robinson (@NathanJRobinson) April 25, 2022\n\nRobinson apparently thinks that Trump\'s ability to win reelection hinges on whether he\'s on Twitter. Not the shape of the U.S. economy, the direction of the pandemic, or whether President Joe Biden\'s ill-considered policies have created an opening for the former president…but Twitter.\n\nFrustratingly, many liberals and progressives—especially in the media—have convinced themselves that the only way to effectively counter bad speech is to label it misinformation or harassment and prevent it from being uttered. This runs counter to Musk\'s stated views on the subject, which reflect classically liberal ideas about speech.\n\nI hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 25, 2022\n\nIt\'s strange to see this idea—that silencing opponents is not only self-defeating but also wrong on principle—transformed into an explicitly right-wing talking point. This is a demoralizing result of the new political reality, in which the journalists and bureaucrats who comprise Team Blue fear and distrust speech they cannot control, while Team Red purports to love free speech even as its political figures wage war on speech they do not like. And it\'s one that does not work to Democrats\' advantage; as Nate Silver points out, free speech in the abstract is extremely popular among the voting public.\n\nThe best way to de-politicize the social media free speech debate—and the optimal thing that Musk could do with control of Twitter—would be to devolve content curation to individual users, as I explained in The Los Angeles Times:\n\n"Elon Musk\'s best bet would be to devolve content curation to individual users. Many on the right are frustrated with Twitter\'s inconsistently applied rules, regardless of whether they are enforced by algorithms or by human employees of the company; many progressives, on the other hand, are afraid that lax moderation means more misinformation or harassment. The least polarizing way forward is to give users more means of controlling their own feeds. If you have a low tolerance for unpleasantness, you should be able to turn on a setting that shields you from the worst of what can appear on the platform. If you prefer the Wild West, there should be a setting for you, too."\n\nIn any case, I hope that fixing Twitter doesn\'t distract Musk from his far more important goal of colonizing Mars (something NPR criticized as imperialist, because of course they did).

The Diff\'s Byrne Hobart took this a step further, outlining how "Twitter should monetize a protocol rather than run an app," and explaining the tension between Twitter as a consumer product and as "a way for individual users to update a universal shared database, which can then be filtered based on who\'s interested in what." Hobart claims that it\'s possible that Twitter has been "radically miss-monetized," and that Musk could potentially realign its priorities. However, little of the online discourse has focused on the technical possibilities.\n\nThe new Twitter owner has, through coy tweets, hinted that his new policies will not be applied arbitrarily and that consistent application will mean some number of right-wing users currently cheering his new ownership will surely be disappointed:\n\nI hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 25, 2022\n\nA social media platform\'s policies are good if the most extreme 10% on left and right are equally unhappy — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 19, 2022\n\nElsewhere, Musk has said that Twitter is a "town square" or "public square," and that banning people from using the platform effectively prevents them from participating in the important discussions of the day.\n\nThough people who care about fostering a culture of free speech may agree with the tenor of Musk\'s comments, the analogy is a terrible one. For most of America, the public square is the school board meeting and the town council meeting. There are also numerous other privates spaces for civic engagement: the church pulpit and the post-sermon fray it inspires; neighborhood listservs and the cesspool that is NextDoor; or maybe it\'s Facebook, in-person conversations, and email lists. For many millions of Americans, Twitter is not integral to hashing out values, concerns, and disagreements. Think of the implications if we expected the government to treat such companies—which have their own terms of service and standards that they are free to decide and we are free to consent to—as something akin to public utilities.\n\nIf anything, the new owner of a social media company should convey an inflated sense of the platform\'s worth! But Musk has at times, despite his forceful defense of free speech culture on the internet, repeated confused talking points that indicate scattered thinking while simultaneously failing to fully flesh out what day-to-day operations will look like. For example, a lot of content moderation involves the unsexy—and not very ideological—challenge of keeping spam under control. And, as Mike Masnick points out at Techdirt, Musk doesn\'t seem to have a particularly robust understanding of "hate speech" and how much of what we call hate speech is, in fact, protected by the First Amendment.\n\nA lot remains to be seen about how Twitter will change and what Musk will bring to the table. Optimism, with some reservations about Musk\'s ability to execute, seems warranted. Hysteria—like declaring that it\'s now open season for white supremacists, that Musk\'s vision for free speech will be "lethal," or that Musk is an echo of imperialist, colonizer forebears because he wants to go to Mars—is not.', 'image': 'https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2022/04/thumbnail-9-3.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:46'}

Musk paid $44 billion to acquire the social media platform with the stated aim of turning it into a haven for "free speech."\n\nThe web is awash in speculation over what that means. Conservatives and people booted off the platform have pushed for Musk to reinstate banned accounts, including that of former President Donald Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, prominent Twitter figures are now saying they\'ll leave the platform in protest of its new owner. Among them is English actress Jameela Jamil, who tweeted her fears Monday that Musk "is going to help this hell platform reach its final form of totally lawless hate, bigotry, and misogyny."\n\nIt\'s unclear whether Musk will be able to realize all his plans for Twitter. The tech leader has floated less moderation, less advertising and an open-source algorithm. But Musk\'s stated ideals contradict his own actions.\n\nWhat Musk says he wants\n\nMusk has made clear he wants less moderation — which he considers censorship — on the platform.\n\n"Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated," he said in Monday\'s announcement about the acquisition.\n\nHe also said he wants to defeat the "spambots," or automated accounts that mimic real users; open the algorithm to public inspection and "authenticate all humans" using the platform.\n\nMusk laid out a definition of speech in a TED interview last week.\n\n"A good sign as to whether there is free speech is, is someone you don\'t like allowed to say something you don\'t like? If that is the case, we have free speech," he said.\n\nMusk said Twitter would abide by national laws that restrict speech around the world. Beyond that, he said, he\'d be "very reluctant" to delete posts or permanently ban users who violate the company\'s rules.\n\nHe had previously criticized Trump\'s ban from social media in the wake of the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Twitter and Facebook permanently banned Trump\'s account on the grounds that he incited violence.\n\n"A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech," Musk tweeted days after Trump was banned from both Facebook and Twitter.\n\nHow Musk responds to disagreement\n\nMusk\'s own history, however, puts in doubt his commitment to let people he doesn\'t like speak. As the newsletter Popular Information has documented, Musk has regularly blocked users who criticize him or Tesla; threatened pro-union Tesla employees and company whistleblowers; and has aggressively gone after short-sellers and journalists who are critical of Tesla, sometimes calling their work "false" or "misleading."\n\nIn 2018, he launched a vendetta against Linette Lopez, an Insider journalist critical of Tesla, a move which writer Felix Salmon called "obsessive and deranged."\n\nMusk\'s popular tweets typically send a swarm of his social media fans directly to the accounts of reporters to harass them for hours or days.\n\nSome academics say that Musk\'s hands-off approach threatens to bring Twitter to its bad old days, when harassment and abuse were rampant.\n\n"With Musk, his posturing of free speech — just leave everything up — that would be bad in and of itself," said Paul Barrett, the deputy director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University. "If you stop moderating — with automated systems and human reviews — a site like Twitter, in the space of a short period of time, you would have a cesspool."\n\nSome former Twitter employees are also dismayed by Musk\'s successful bid for the company.\n\n"Twitter is going to let a man-child essentially take over their platform," said Leslie Miley, a former Twitter employee who has also worked for Google and Apple. Miley, who was the only Black engineer at Twitter in a leadership position when he left the company in 2015, echoed doubts shared by others about Musk\'s grasp of the platform\'s complexities.\n\n"I am not sure if Elon knows what he is getting," Miley said. "He may just find that having Twitter is a lot different than wanting Twitter."\n\nUnfettered expression does not attract advertisers\n\nA decade ago, a Twitter executive called the company "the free speech wing of the free speech party," underscoring its commitment to untrammeled freedom of expression. But the company reversed itself after reports of online abuse and harassment became frequent.\n\nIn the U.S., a visceral 2014 article by journalist Amanda Hess exposed the incessant, vile harassment many women faced just for posting on Twitter or other online forums. Twitter also learned about the consequences of an unmoderated social platform: mainly, that it undercut their funding from advertisers.\n\nAds are how Twitter makes money, and companies generally don\'t want their ads running against violent threats, hate speech that bleeds into incitement or incendiary information aimed at tipping elections or undermining public health.\n\nGoogle, Barrett pointed out, quickly learned this lesson the hard way when major companies like Toyota and Anheuser-Busch yanked their ads after they ran ahead of YouTube videos produced by extremists in 2015.\n\nOnce it was clear just how unhealthy the conversation had gotten, Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey spent years trying to improve what he called the "health" of the conversation on the platform.\n\nThe company was an early adopter of the "report abuse" button after U.K. member of parliament Stella Creasy received a barrage of rape and death threats on the platform. The online abuse was the result of a seemingly positive tweet in support of feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez, who successfully advocated for novelist Jane Austen to appear on a British banknote. Creasy\'s online harasser was sent to prison for 18 weeks.\n\nTwitter has continued to craft rules and invest in staff and technology that detected violent threats, harassment and misinformation that violated its policies. After evidence emerged that Russia used Twitter\'s platforms to try to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election, social media companies stepped up their efforts against political misinformation. All have struggled with defining "misinformation," however, and been accused of both leaving up false content as well as over-censoring legitimate posts.\n\nHard to unwind moderation\n\nThe big question now is how far Musk wants to ratchet back these systems — and whether users and advertisers will stick around if he does.\n\nLike Miley, the former Twitter engineer, experts who have studied content moderation and researched Twitter express doubt that Musk knows what he is getting into. After all, there are plenty of fledgling examples of so-called free speech-focused platforms that have been launched in the past few years as Twitter alternatives, largely by conservatives unhappy with the Twitter\'s crackdown on hate, harassment and misinformation. Many such sites have struggled to deal with toxic content, and at least one has been cut off by its own technology providers in protest.\n\n"This move just shows how effective (moderation features) have been to annoy those in power," said Kirsten Martin, a professor of technology ethics at the University of Notre Dame. "I would be worried as to how this would change Twitter\'s values."\n\nThe fact that no other bidders emerged in public before Musk\'s deal was a sign that other would-be acquirers might find Twitter too difficult to improve, said Third Bridge analyst Scott Kessler.\n\n"This platform is pretty much the same one we\'ve had over the last decade or so," Kessler said. "You\'ve had a lot of smart people trying to figure out what they should do, and they\'ve had trouble. It\'s probably going to be tough to make a lot of headway."\n\nEven now, Americans say they\'re more likely to be harassed on social media than any other online forum, with women, people of color and LGBTQ users reporting a disproportionate amount of that abuse. Roughly 80% of users believe the companies are still doing only a "fair or poor" job of handling that harassment, according to a Pew Research Center survey of U.S. adults last year.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/04/30/39aaad79-fd57-40fa-b203-bc4143cf40f2/thumbnail/1200x630g8/aef00fb0dcf931880dd52af0a50dc345/gettyimages-1206290121.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:24'}

In Canada, vaccine-free Canadians still cannot board a train or a plane and travel from one region of the country to another.\n\nIn Canada, air and train travel are regulated by the federal government, even when you travel within the same province. The feds have made it so only a vaccine passport, or very limited jab exemptions, will afford you the opportunity to visit family, friends, or travel for work.\n\nThis means that if you lived in, let’s say, Kitchener, Ontario, you could not get on a VIA Rail train and travel to Toronto… even though you could travel from Kitchener to Toronto on a commuter train that is not under federal jurisdiction.\n\nIsn’t “science” wonderful!\n\nOh, and vaccine-free Canadians also can’t LEAVE the country. Unjabbed Canadians are told they can’t “put others at risk” by boarding a plane with vaccinated people (because vaccines suddenly…work?). Apparently, it is good for the unvaccinated to stay in Canada, even though … they are risk to everyone else who is protected by a vaccine?\n\nTrudeau’s insecurity on display\n\nNow, on the one hand it is quite easy to understand why Trudeau is acting like an evil dictator: he has proven himself to be an immoral tyrant on many occasions. However, given the fact that other leftist tyrants have eased up, it is clearly not just leftism or progressivism that causing him to trap Canadians indefinitely in their home like real-life versions of The Truman Show. (How fitting that it was Canadian Jim Carrey who starred in that film.)\n\nThere is something unique about Trudeau that is causing him to become “regressive” as the rest of the leftist dominated West is affording vaccine-free citizens their civil rights.\n\nTo the outside world, Trudeau may look like a confident – if not cringeworthy – tin-pot dictator, but in reality, he is a 50-year-old boy with little to no virtue. He is essentially a spoiled teenager who can remember lines and present himself well in a tailored suit and has a family name that tricked people into thinking he was competent.\n\nHis (Canadian) father, Pierre Trudeau, for all his faults, was shrewd and intelligent – even if evil. Justin Trudeau is evil and unintelligent and quite obtuse.\n\nI can’t help but think he believes he must prove himself as being his own verified dictator in order to fill his daddy’s shoes. Simply put, he is insecure and projecting.\n\n— Article continues below Petition — PETITION: Ask Elon Musk to REINSTATE LifeSite\'s Twitter accounts Show Petition Text 7936 have signed the petition.

Sign this Petition Please SIGN and SHARE this petition to the new owner of Twitter, Elon Musk, asking him to reinstate LifeSiteNews\' truth-telling Twitter accounts which have been suspended since early 2021. After contentious negotiations, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has purchased Twitter, thereby transforming the tech giant into a private company. A self-styled "free speech absolutist," Mr. Musk\'s entrepreneurial spirit may define his approach to governing Twitter, where, in the marketplace of ideas, the best ideas - not those aided by censorship - will naturally prevail among the competition. Of course, there are limits to free speech. But, for too long, Big Tech giants (including, Twitter, Google, YouTube and Facebook) have subjected their conservative and Christian users to all forms of censorship, desperately trying to silence our voices. So if, as it seems, Mr. Musk will level the playing field for conservatives and Christians and allow a true exchange of ideas to occur on his platform, then we look forward to our chance to re-engage on Twitter. Please SIGN and SHARE this petition to the new owner of Twitter, Elon Musk, asking him to reactivate LifeSiteNews\' truth-telling Twitter accounts which have been suspended since early 2021. They are: https://twitter.com/LifeSite\n\nhttps://twitter.com/LSNCatholic\n\nhttps://twitter.com/WCDM_LSN\n\nhttps://twitter.com/WCEA_LSN These accounts have been blocked by the outgoing Twitter regime for more than a year for calling a ‘transgender woman’ (Assistant Secretary of Health, \'Rachel\' Levine), a man, and for tweeting an article about the same person. The article we tweeted makes mention of the troubling paradox of having a person who denies the basic science of the human anatomy be in an authoritative position in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), but does not cast aspersions or any other such “hate speech” against Levine, according to Twitter’s "rules." It is our fervant hope that Mr. Musk intends to allow - rather than censor - our descriptions of reality as we know them to be true in regards to human sexuality, as well as in other areas of life. Mr. Musk evidently understands how significant freedom of speech is to the functioning of a free society as he was quoted as saying that this deal is important for "the future of civlization." LifeSiteNews believes that being able to spread the truth in charity is absolutely vital for the future of society, as the "truth shall make you free." (Jn 8:32) And so, in order for us to charitably spread the truth far and wide, we now seek to re-engage on Twitter\'s public square.

The New Democrats have cozied up to Trudeau in order to pretend they are a sane and legitimate party and have promised to prop up his regime. Promises don’t really mean anything when politicians make them, so we shouldn’t assume that the communists will be loyal to each other.\n\nHowever, it is obvious that public opinion is against Trudeau to a degree that he will not be able to withstand.\n\nThere is a reason why Trudeau had to resort to the Emergencies Act to squash the Freedom Convoy; no one wanted to stop it until they were forced to by law.\n\nThe various levels of provincial and municipal governance could have stopped the movement the way they stop any non-violent protest – but they didn’t want to.\n\nDoes this mean that the cops and all the citizens supported the convoy? Of course not, but I think that enough of them saw how absurd things have become and just wanted something to make the whole charade of 2020-2021-2022 go away.\n\nThe application of the Emergencies Act was wildly unpopular among Canadians, both on the Left and the Right. Leftists were happy to see the movement end but were unimpressed that Trudeau ended it in such an absurd way. Conservatives generally supported the movement, and therefore saw Trudeau as a complete lunatic for doing what he did.\n\nAll of this means that in the long run Trudeau is hurting his reputation, even among his base. This is not news for him as the Conservative leadership race heats up.\n\nFreedom is on the move\n\nWithout giving the impression that I think Canada is on the brink of some massive societal restoration, I would be remiss if I did not speak to the positives.\n\nCurrently, we are witnessing the first real Conservative leadership race in a long time. Pierre Pollievre is filling arenas and convention centres with freedom-loving crowds, and Leslyn Lewis is making leftist journalists look silly on national TV. It is worth remembering that we are talking about a leadership race, not an election, but the swell of right-wing uprising is palpable.\n\nIn fact, the last time something like this happened was after a groundswell of Christian/right-wing sentiment following years of leftist oppression under the former Trudeau and his successors.\n\nAs a result of that, we had Stephen Harper for a decade who, although not perfect, was a saint compared with Trudeau.\n\nThe economy is tanking in Canada, and goods and services are becoming prohibitively expensive for average people. Trudeau and his cronies can appeal to idealism and progressivism all they want, but even left-wingers get ticked off and want change when they are struggling to fill the tank.\n\nUltimately, Trudeau is continuing to trap vaccine-free Canadians from participating fully in society because he knows that if he pulls the plug on his last failing restriction, that his regime will go down the drain.\n\nKennedy Hall is an Ontario based journalist for LifeSiteNews.

The board [of Twitter] will have to make sure that if it operates in Europe it will have to fulfill the obligations, including moderation, open algorithms, freedom of speech, transparency in rules, obligations to comply with our own rules for hate speech, revenge porn [and] harassment," said Breton, adding "If [Twitter] does not comply with our law, there are sanctions — 6 per cent of the revenue and, if they continue, banned from operating in Europe."', 'image': 'https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2022-04/musk%202.jpg?itok=_6ovvCP5', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:12'}

Jody Hice (R-Ga.), in all caps. A Twitter survey by Sen. Ted Cruz asked if Musk’s purchase was a good thing, with the only options to answer being “yes” or “no, I hate free speech.” His fellow Texan, Rep. John Carter, signaled his approval with no words at all; three clapping-hands emojis were sufficient.\n\nA pot-smoking, meme-posting evangelist for electric vehicles may be an unlikely hero for conservatives. But the Tesla chief executive’s amorphous vow to restore free speech to the social media platform has resonated among Republicans, who see themselves — starting with their de facto leader, former President Trump — as unfairly targeted by Twitter’s content moderation efforts.\n\nConservatives said their euphoric outpouring was bigger than the possible return of @RealDonaldTrump and changes to Twitter’s ownership. Rather, they see Musk’s takeover as a symbolic, and cathartic, blow against Big Tech, which the right has increasingly viewed with antipathy.\n\n“There’s a gut reaction from a lot of people, going, ‘You know what, it’s about time they get their comeuppance,’ ” said Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.). “It finally feels like someone is standing up for a principle that has been going in an opposite direction lately: less free speech, less ability to express yourself — if you are a conservative.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk centered his bid for Twitter on the premise that the social media company, which he considers a “digital town square,” is too restrictive in clamping down on expression.\n\n“I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” Musk tweeted Monday morning.\n\nMusk’s own politics are idiosyncratic. He’s the foremost face of clean vehicles who called for immediately increasing oil and gas production after the Ukraine-Russia war spiked energy prices. He fled California for Texas because of high taxes but declined to weigh in on Texas’ restrictive abortion law, saying he preferred to “stay out of politics.” He has described himself as politically independent and registered to vote in California with no party preference.\n\nFor conservatives, Musk’s crusade against content restrictions has struck a chord. Roughly half of Republicans feel they cannot express themselves freely on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, according to a Morning Consult poll conducted this month, far exceeding the percentage of Democrats and independents who felt similarly.\n\nPolitics Who did Twitter ban during the Trump era, and why? Could banned Trump allies return to Twitter under Elon Musk? A look at the former president’s backers who were kicked off the social media platform.\n\n“Twitter is a platform that I and many others believe has been more aggressive in blocking Republicans and conservatives than they have toward people on the left,” said Rep. Austin Scott (R-Ga.). “I’m hoping and expecting he will undo that.”\n\nScott is not an avid Twitter user; he does not even have the app on his phone. But he did tweet a congratulatory message to Musk, adding a plea to “restore free speech and bring back President Trump!”\n\nTrump was permanently kicked off the platform on Jan. 8, 2021 — two days after a group of his supporters overran the U.S. Capitol in hopes of blocking the certification of Joe Biden’s win. Twitter imposed the ban “due to the risk of further incitement of violence.”\n\nSo far, Musk has not indicated how he’d handle the former president’s account. Trump, meanwhile, has shown no interest in rejoining the platform that helped power his political rise and gave real-time narration of his presidency.\n\n“I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,” Trump told Fox News, referring to his fledgling social media network. “I hope Elon buys Twitter, because he’ll make improvements to it, and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth.”\n\nRepublicans see Trump as just one example of Twitter’s bias. A number of high-profile conservatives have been suspended or blocked from the platform, including the account of the Babylon Bee, a satirical news website that was suspended for a tweet naming Assistant Health Secretary Rachel Levine, who is transgender, “Man of the Year.”\n\nThe account was locked as a violation of Twitter’s ban on hate speech. Seth Dillon, CEO of Babylon Bee, refused to remove the tweet, asserting that “truth is not hate speech.”\n\n“It’s completely broken,” said Harmeet Dhillon, a conservative lawyer who has sued Twitter multiple times on behalf of clients who were banned. “The company can try to affect elections, try to ban politicians from speaking ... use algorithms, enable false accounts to constantly affect what people see.”\n\nThe extent to which conservatives face bias on the platform has been fiercely examined and debated. A study this month by researchers at MIT and Yale found that Republican users tend to be suspended more often than Democrats but that conservatives are more likely to share misinformation that would provoke such suspensions.\n\nSo far, Musk has offered little explanation as to how his free speech values would play out in practice. He said on Monday that his goals include “enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots and authenticating all humans.”\n\nBut such efforts would require some attempt at regulating content, especially by verifying users. A social media network without any moderation at all could swamp the platform with all sorts of unsavory or offensive material, such as pornography or terrorist content, as well as the online abuse and harassment that are already common occurrences.\n\n“If you don’t have content moderation, you actually have less free speech. The people who are the loudest are the bullies and harassers that drive people away,” said Katie Harbath, a former Republican operative who has worked as public policy director for Facebook.\n\nDhillon, the conservative attorney based in California, said she is not hoping for Musk to completely abandon regulation.\n\n“There’s plenty of room for them to do old-school content moderation of the kind they originally did,” she said, citing as an example prohibitions on making death threats.\n\nWith Musk’s plans still unknown, Harbath, who now runs a tech policy strategy firm, said the celebratory conservatives “are making a hell of a lot of assumptions of what Elon means by all this stuff. I don’t think they should assume he is completely on their side.”\n\nRepublicans’ triumphant tone on Twitter starkly contrasted with the more muted reaction from liberal politicians. Far fewer Democratic members of Congress weighed in on Twitter, although those who did were markedly unenthused.\n\n“This deal is dangerous for our democracy. Billionaires like Elon Musk play by a different set of rules than everyone else, accumulating power for their own gain. We need a wealth tax and strong rules to hold Big Tech accountable,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), with whom Musk has sparred on Twitter.\n\nHuizenga, the Michigan congressman, expected that liberals would be none too pleased with Musk’s purchase. Indeed, some vowed to leave the site entirely — much to Huizenga’s amusement.\n\n“It seems like ‘I’m quitting Twitter’ has become the ‘I’m moving to Canada if Trump wins,’ ” he said, adding, “It’s kind of fun sitting back, watching them completely lose their collective minds.”', 'image': 'https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ac14b68/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2941x1544+0+208/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F86%2F23%2Ff46440b54bd7a6509db9c67caab5%2Fphilanthropy-billionaries-tax-28080.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:57'}

(Patrick Pleul/Pool/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nElon Musk Reveals More Details of His Plans for Twitter After Buyout\n\nElon Musk revealed more details of what he has in mind for changes at Twitter after it was confirmed that the company had accepted his buyout offer, with the tech mogul’s plans including new features and ways to enhance trust in the platform.\n\nTwitter’s board of directors said on April 25 that it had approved Musk’s offer to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share in cash, in a deal worth around $44 billion.\n\nThe buyout represents a 38 percent premium over Twitter’s closing stock price on April 1, with Parag Agrawal, CEO of Twitter, saying in a statement that he believes the deal “is the best path forward for Twitter’s stockholders.”\n\n‘Bedrock of a Functioning Democracy’\n\nIn a statement, Musk provided some details about what kind of changes he has in mind for the social media platform, whose commitment to free speech he has repeatedly called into question.\n\n“Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,” Musk said. This dovetails with his earlier statements that Twitter functions as a “de facto town square” where important conversations should be able to take place with as few constraints as possible.\n\nMusk said Monday that Twitter has “tremendous potential” and that he wants to work with the company and its users to “unlock” and make the platform “better than ever.”\n\nHe said he plans on “enhancing” Twitter with new features, which he did not provide further details on. Musk earlier created a Twitter poll asking users if they want an edit button on the platform, suggesting that this could be one of the changes he is seeking to effect.\n\nMusk also said on Monday he wants to make the platform’s algorithms “open source to increase trust,” while “defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.”\n\nThis, too, reinforces his earlier remarks that his objective in seeking to buy Twitter and turn it into a private company was to transform it into a bastion of free speech by opening up its algorithm to public scrutiny and by making its moderation policies more transparent.\n\n‘Black Box Algorithm’\n\nA self-described “free speech absolutist,” Musk told the audience at a recent TED event in Vancouver, Canada, that Twitter should permit unconstrained expression, though it should do so in line with the law.\n\n“In my view, Twitter should match the laws of the country,” Musk said, acknowledging reasonable legal caps on free speech like direct incitement to violence or shouting “fire” in a crowded theater.\n\n“But going beyond that and having it be unclear who’s making what changes to where, having tweets mysteriously be promoted and demoted with no insight into what’s going on, having a black box algorithm promote some things and not other things, I think this can be quite dangerous,” Musk said.\n\n“My strong, intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization,” he added.\n\nErr on Side of Free Speech\n\nMusk also expressed reluctance about permanent bans of users from Twitter, preferring instead temporary “time-outs.”\n\n“I’m not saying that I have all the answers here,” Musk said at the TED talk. But I do think that we want to be just very reluctant to delete things, just be very cautious with permanent bans. Timeouts I think are better than permanent bans.”\n\nIn terms of calibrating Twitter’s moderation policies, Musk said he’d want to err on the side of free speech.\n\n“If in doubt, let the speech, let it exist,” Musk said. “If it’s a grey area, I would say let the tweet exist. But obviously in a case where there’s perhaps a lot of controversy, that you would not want to necessarily promote that tweet.”\n\n“A good sign as to whether there’s free speech is, is someone you don’t like allowed to say something you don’t like,” Musk said. “And if that is the case, then we have free speech.”\n\n‘We Are Concerned’\n\nMusk has repeatedly questioned Twitter’s commitment to free speech, after accusations that the platform suppressed some minority and politically conservative viewpoints, claims Twitter has denied.\n\nMany free speech advocates have hailed Musk’s takeover bid, while those opposed have expressed fear that fewer constraints on expression on Twitter will make it too easy to abuse the platform’s reach and power by, for example, spreading disinformation.\n\nIn a series of tweets reacting to Musk’s takeover moves, Amnesty International expressed concern about the erosion of policies meant to protect users.\n\n“We are concerned with any steps that Twitter might take to erode enforcement of the policies and mechanisms designed to protect users,” Amnesty International wrote.\n\n“The last thing we need is a Twitter that wilfully turns a blind eye to violent and abusive speech against users,” the group said.\n\nAs it was confirmed Musk would purchase Twitter, the Tesla founder urged his “worst critics” to stay on the platform.\n\n“I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” he wrote in a Twitter post.\n\nDan Ives, an analyst at investment firm Wedbush Securities, told the BBC that he expects most users will take a “wait-and-see approach” on whether they stay or leave the platform, based on the changes that take place.\n\n“Now it’s about courting new users and stopping defectors from the platform,” Ives told the outlet.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/19/article-image-cal-thomas-3-1200x804.jpeg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:50'}

I really believe that they\'re sick people," Trump responded.\n\nWhen asked if he misses Twitter, Trump declined to answer, instead promoting his own social media platform, Truth Social, though many have criticized the app\'s reliability in the first two months since it launched.\n\n"But we need a voice," Trump said. "The good news is I have a voice because I do interviews."\n\nHe added that since he was banned, Twitter has now become "boring."\n\nSome have speculated that Trump\'s account could be reinstated after Musk purchased the platform Monday for about $44 billion, a possibility that has excited some conservatives.\n\nTrump\'s active use of Twitter became a hallmark of his presidency, with his tweets often landing him in hot water. But concerns about potential violence prompted the company—as well as other social media platforms—to ban him after the Capitol riot.\n\nMusk has not yet said whether he would move to unban Trump. But in the past, Musk has advocated for "free speech" on the platform.\n\n"Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated," he said in a joint statement with Twitter following his purchase.\n\nEven if his account were no longer banned, Trump may not make a return.\n\n"Twitter\'s become very boring. They\'ve gotten rid of a lot of good voices on Twitter, a lot of their conservative voices," he said during a recent interview with SiriusXM\'s Americano Media.\n\nDevin Nunes, the CEO of Trump Media & Technology Group, also said Monday that Trump would likely not make a Twitter return.\n\n"Well, I can only report what he said. He said he really doesn\'t have an interest in going on Twitter, and my guess is that would continue to be the same," Nunes said during a Fox News interview.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Twitter for comment.', 'image': 'https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2026561/trump-calls-twitter-mentally-ill-ban.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:01'}

This feels like the first flashback scene we see in a dystopian drama after the words “SIX MONTHS EARLIER …” Quite where we’ll be in six months’ time as far as Twitter is concerned remains tantalisingly unclear, but it seems difficult to imagine it will be either a more or less pleasant space. It’s a social media platform. I’m not sure what further evidence humanity needs before we cotton on to the idea that such a thing might be an intrinsically toxic concept. Of course, there will always be some people who think it just hasn’t been done right yet. Like communism, or a British version of The Daily Show.\n\nAnyway, if Musk’s takeover goes through, he’ll assume control of a platform where the people on the right are incredibly angry about free speech, and those on the left are incredibly angry about hate speech. Which is to say: they have so much in common. As the tech visionary Jaron Lanier has long been excellent at pointing out, the best way to keep people on platforms is to make them angry. So the platforms are designed to make them angry. You might consider the anger worth it for your version of advertising (I myself will post this column on Twitter), but even then it is a weirdly grim cost of doing business that just conceivably ought to be weighed far more carefully than it is.\n\nUnlike the UK, Musk manufactures other things besides anger, but Twitter is the platform where, in a single calendar year, his posts led to multiple lawsuits, a fall in his stock price, and a Securities and Exchange Commission settlement that resulted in his chairmanship of Tesla being forcibly ended. Yet in a move that will feel familiar to a lot of Twitter users, he has not logged off, but leaned in further. When I was a child, there was a guy called Victor Kiam who owned Remington, and he would personally feature in the firm’s electric razor adverts, going: “I liked the shaver so much, I bought the company.” It would be nice to see Musk do something similar. “I liked calling innocent people paedos so much, I bought the company.”\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the distress of Twitter users feels overplayed. Perhaps Elon embodies a kind of radical honesty and self-awareness not shared by other denizens of the site. People who seem to spend half their lives complaining about Twitter, on Twitter, seem stunned by the idea that a shitposter would ultimately buy it. Catch up! It doesn’t feel like a complete coincidence that all social media platforms are owned by men you’d run a mile from socially.\n\nMusk is one of them – a brilliant, horrid, ridiculous and very occasionally endearing grotesque. A sort of intergalactically successful Dominic Cummings. And yet, despite Elon’s give-a-toss gift for making himself what Twitter users might call the “main character”, I can’t detest him entirely. If he pulls off the radical green energy transition embodied in Tesla, or even just one of his other wildly ambitious schemes, humans might have to accept some of the shit that’s gone with it. Accept it angrily, of course – how else, we’re on a social media platform! – but accept it nonetheless. A huge number of other people in public life behave appallingly and achieve absolutely nothing but harm.\n\nBut if endlessly righteous folk balk at the mere idea of necessary evils, why do they act like their own involvement in Twitter is one? It isn’t. It’s easy to focus on the high-profile people who are always on Twitter. But the sheer numbers of highly successful, highly creative and highly interesting people in the worlds of arts, business, science and beyond who AREN’T on it should tell a much more powerful story. They are part of all kinds of era-defining creative and commercial conversations and breakthroughs – and somehow manage to do it all without lavishing half the day scrolling past a bunch of other people having a row.\n\nLanier has cast detailed doubt on whether most Twitter advocacy is even meaningfully effective, despite sometimes appearing to be so. If you spend your day caught up in online fighting, it’s preferable to tell yourself you’re involved in consciousness-raising for your cause. An alternative view is that you are simply obsessively polarising your particular debate, to the point where compromise – boring, unfashionable, yet historically always necessary – becomes a more distant possibility.\n\nMy “unpopular opinion”, in one of Twitter’s tellingly popular phrases, is that those who spend a significant amount of time arguing on it work for the platform and not for their cause. The Musk takeover at least makes it easier to see whose pocket you’re putting money into as you delude yourself you’re winning arguments. I’m certainly not saying I follow this rule, but in general I think arguing on the internet is like playing real tennis: even if you win, you’re still a twat.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5899b28a3a52d992407b1aa95d2689c2b1d4703f/0_273_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=e4d7eefe6e510bd81cf93360935a1d81', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:53'}

After news of Musk’s takeover, news website Politico contacted several top Republican members and aides to gauge reaction to a potential Trump Twitter return.\n\n“Every single one of them told us that they hoped the former president stays the hell away from Twitter,” Politico reported.\n\nTrump himself has said he won’t be back, telling Fox News: “I am going to be staying on Truth.”\n\nThe twice-impeached former commander-in-chief is not known for his consistency, however. He has reportedly expressed discontent with how Truth Social has performed – “What the fuck is going on,” the Daily Beast reported Trump as asking aides in March – and to return to relevance, and to win back the spotlight he craves, the former president might need Twitter.\n\n“If he wants to intervene on behalf of a candidate he has now endorsed in the midterm elections, being able to reach that number of people with messages supporting those candidates is a way of essentially getting free advertising time to reach people who are more likely to vote as a result of getting a signal from Donald Trump,” Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, told Time.\n\nTrump may have insisted that he will snub Twitter and stick with Truth Social, but his commitment to his own platform has so far been tepid at best – Trump has posted on Truth Social just once.\n\nIf that lack of interaction hasn’t helped Truth Social, neither did the botched rollout on 21 February. Tens of thousands of people were unable to access the network – the Guardian was finally allowed in on 5 March – and by early April the Truth Social app was the 355th most popular on Apple devices.\n\nIn terms of daily active users, Truth Social had 513,000, the Daily Beast reported. Twitter has about 217 million.\n\nLack of usage – both by Trump and by the general public – is not the only problem the new network faces.\n\nShares in Digital World Acquisition Corporation, the firm which plans to merge with Trump Media & Technology Group, dropped 13% on Monday after news of Musk’s deal. Since Musk became the largest shareholder in Twitter TMTG shares have fallen by 44% overall, and two key Truth Social executives quit the platform in April.\n\nSince Trump was removed from Twitter his missives have been limited to email blasts sent from his Save America Pac, the messages frequently bleating about a “stolen election” in 2020. At the moment those emails are received by a mixture of supporters and vaguely interested journalists.\n\nIf Trump resumed tweeting, he’d have a far bigger audience for his misinformation – which could have serious consequences.\n\n“The real danger would come after election day,” Gertz said, “when he could use that same megaphone to spread lies about voter fraud as a pretext for overturning elections.

Those measures aim to make the services more appealing to advertisers seeking a safe venue, and to better accommodate politicians and regulators arguing that the platforms are responsible for all of their content. But the moves have alienated some users who, like Mr. Musk, say they go overboard.\n\nHow Twitter operates won’t be entirely up to Mr. Musk.\n\n“Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules—regardless of their shareholding,” Thierry Breton, the EU regulator, wrote Tuesday on Twitter. “Mr Musk knows this well.”\n\nMr. Breton expressed confidence that Twitter, under Mr. Musk’s ownership, would conform to the bloc’s new rules, which still need formal approval from the EU Parliament and representatives from EU countries.\n\nMr. Musk’s planned changes at Twitter, and the response, will be closely watched. Twitter is smaller and less profitable than other social-media companies. It claims 217 million so-called monetizable daily users compared with 1.9 billion daily users for Meta Platforms Inc.’s core Facebook platform and a billion-plus monthly users for TikTok. But Twitter users include media personalities, politicians, activists and tech aficionados who help shape social discourse.\n\n“It has influence way beyond its user base and way beyond its valuation, and so we care about it,” said David Kaye, former United Nations special rapporteur focused on free speech and now a law professor at the University of California, Irvine.\n\nTwitter’s existing content policies haven’t brought about huge financial success; it has struggled to deliver consistent profits. Photo: Laura Morton for The Wall Street Journal\n\nMr. Musk, chief executive of Tesla Inc. and Space Exploration Technologies Corp. as well as the world’s richest person, is one of Twitter’s most prominent users, employing the platform for everything from promoting his companies to battling rivals and critics. In Monday’s deal announcement, he said he wants to open up Twitter’s algorithms to public scrutiny, “defeat” spammers and authenticate users’ identities.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Musk said he views “free speech” as that permitted by the law—a far broader definition of what is allowable than most major social networks have adopted. “I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law,” he said in a tweet. “If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect. Therefore, going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people.”\n\nSome industry executives and analysts say Mr. Musk is in for an awakening. Reversing Twitter’s efforts risks stoking advertisers’ worries about the placement of their ads, potentially pushing them toward competitors like Snap Inc. and Meta, said Ben Black, co-head of internet research at Deutsche Bank.\n\nElon Musk struck a deal on Monday to buy Twitter for about $44 billion, moving the world’s richest man a step closer to taking control of the social-media platform. Photo: Ryan Lash/TED Conferences, LLC/AFP via Getty Images\n\n“Do you really want to have your Mercedes-Benz commercial against a beheading?” he said. “If someone falls overboard on a cruise ship, do you want your vacation message being advertised against that content?” He said less moderation could also drive away some users, potentially slowing growth.\n\n“‘Do you really want to have your Mercedes-Benz commercial against a beheading?’” — Ben Black, co-head of internet research at Deutsche Bank\n\nIn the company’s early years, Twitter executives were loath to remove content unless it broke local laws. The platform often took a hands-off approach even to content from officially designated terrorist groups, drawing criticism from researchers, lawmakers and victims’ families.\n\nIt stepped up moderation over the years, removing accounts connected to the terrorist group ISIS in 2014, for example. That accelerated during and after the 2016 U.S. presidential race, which saw a jump in complaints about white nationalists and others using the platform to attack and harass minority users.\n\nOther industry leaders who favored looser policies, including Meta co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, have gradually embraced more intervention. Platforms including Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest Inc. and Reddit Inc. all have added staff or bolstered rules to monitor their content, though each draws the lines differently.\n\nTheir efforts target a range of potentially problematic content, from hate speech and false information about elections to what they see as fringe views on health, along with other issues the platforms consider harmful. Pinterest recently banned posts that it deems to contain misinformation about climate change.\n\nTwitter and other platforms also have systems allowing users to report claims of abuse by other users, which can lead to account suspensions that some of those involved say can be arbitrary or unfair.\n\nMore moderating has required complex, and often confusing, guidelines for employees and users. Such efforts have led to some divisive decisions, including bans by Twitter and Facebook of then-President Donald Trump for posts encouraging the rioters who attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, seeking to halt certification of President Biden’s electoral victory.\n\nThose bans were widely praised on the left and by some Republicans. But Mr. Trump and his supporters blasted it and have backed rival social-media apps with fewer restrictions that so far have gained limited traction, including Parler, Gab, and Gettr, which former Trump adviser Jason Miller launched last year.\n\nMany in the Trump camp have voiced support for Mr. Musk’s planned Twitter acquisition, though Mr. Trump told Fox News on Monday that he doesn’t plan to return to the platform and would instead use his social-media startup, Truth Social.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up Technology A weekly digest of tech reviews, headlines, columns and your questions answered by WSJ's Personal Tech gurus. PREVIEW\n\nDevin Nunes, CEO of Truth Social, lauded Monday’s Twitter deal, though he said he doesn’t see the platform, even under Mr. Musk, as a direct competitor because of their different target audiences. “This is a great, great day,” the Trump ally and former GOP congressman said. “Finally we’re getting some movement in the right direction here in terms of opening the internet back up and giving people their voice back.”\n\nTwitter’s existing policies haven’t brought about huge financial success; it has struggled to deliver consistent profits. And losing advertisers might not be a problem for Mr. Musk. He has said he wants the platform to rely less on advertising—which accounts for about 90% of its revenue, totaling $5.1 billion last year—and to focus more on a subscription business model. The platform currently offers Twitter Blue, a $2.99-a-month subscription service that gives customers access to premium features.\n\nDespite Mr. Trump’s comments Monday, many observers and Twitter employees are focused on Mr. Musk’s handling of the former president’s account as a potential indicator of his plans. During an all-hands meeting on Monday, Twitter CEO Parag Agarwal was asked if the company might reinstate Mr. Trump once Mr. Musk’s ownership is completed. Mr. Agarwal said it wasn’t clear.\n\n—Patience Haggin contributed to this article.\n\nElon Musk and Twitter More coverage of the billionaire's bid for Twitter, selected by editors Latest Developments\n\nWrite to Deepa Seetharaman at Deepa.Seetharaman@wsj.com and Meghan Bobrowsky at Meghan.Bobrowsky@wsj.com", 'image': 'https://images.wsj.net/im-531039/social', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:07'}

He was suspended for endorsing a Babylon Bee Twitter post that joked that U.S. Assistant Secretary of Health Rachel Levine, also known as Richard Levine—a biological male who is described as transgender—is the site’s “Man of the Year” for 2022.\n\nIn a statement several weeks ago, Twitter claimed that the Babylon Bee post violated the site’s rules, claiming the joke was “hateful content,” according to the satirical website’s founder, Seth Dillon. Carlson’s account also re-posted a comment from Charlie Kirk saying Levine spent “54 years of his life as a man.”\n\nThe move comes after tech entrepreneur Elon Musk and Twitter came to an agreement for Musk to take the company private for $44 billion on Monday.\n\n“A free Twitter would mean a direct challenge to the people in charge of our country’s institutions many of whom are incompetent,” Carlson said on his top-rated Fox News program on Monday evening. “For the first time in years we’ll be able to talk honestly about our leaders. We’ll be able to have the kind of conversations that make democracy possible.”\n\nMusk’s takeover of Twitter triggered questions about whether certain users, including former President Donald Trump, would return to the platform. Trump, however, told news outlets Monday that he plans on staying with his social media site Truth Social and won’t return to Twitter.\n\n“We’re taking in millions of people, and what we’re finding is that the response on Truth is much better than being on Twitter. Twitter has bots and fake accounts, and we are doing everything we can,” Trump said. So far, Trump has only made one post on Truth Social since it was launched in February 2022.\n\nIn mid-April, Trump told Americano News that “Twitter’s become very boring” in recent months because “they’ve gotten rid of a lot of good voices on Twitter … a lot of their conservative voices.”\n\nThe deal was cemented roughly two weeks after the billionaire first revealed a 9 percent stake in the platform. Musk said last week that he had lined up $46.5 billion in financing to buy Twitter, putting pressure on the company’s board to negotiate a deal.\n\nTwitter said the transaction was unanimously approved by its board of directors and is expected to close in 2022, pending regulatory sign-off and the approval of shareholders.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2018/11/09/Tucker-Carlson-debate-1200x800.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:47'}

The constitutional protection of speech does not, on its own, engender a society in which the chance to be heard is truly abundant and free and equitably distributed.\n\n“Freedom for the wolves has often meant death to the sheep,” Mr. Berlin once said. This is a point often lost on Americans. Government — or large centralized authority — is one threat to liberty but not the only one. When it comes to speech, what has often kept a great many people from speaking isn’t censorship but the lack of a platform. Social media, including Twitter, came along and promised to change that. But when it became a cesspit of hate and harassment for women and people of color in particular, it began to offer a miserable bargain: You can be free to say what you wish, but your life can be made unrelentingly painful if you so dare.\n\nThe “censorship” that Mr. Musk performatively deplores consists of efforts to rectify these very real problems of harassment and abuse. Twitter has taken modest but wildly inadequate steps to improve safety on the platform. It has acknowledged it has a problem. It has recognized positive freedom of speech — the creation of a safe and non-life-ruining environment for the airing of thoughts. And it is this that Mr. Musk and his ilk seem to loathe.\n\nThis is why his deal to purchase Twitter is so dangerous. In recent years, there has been progress toward positive freedom of speech — real work to give everyone, truly everyone, more meaningful occasion to speak. Mr. Musk apparently wants to shut that down. Instead, in a moment of proto-fascism on the political right, his priority seems to be to undam the flood of bile and bigotry and bullying and disinformation.\n\nThe country already faces the very real prospect, starting at noon on Jan. 20, 2025, of a descent toward racist authoritarianism and a protracted slide away from liberal democracy. If your idea of what the country needs in this moment is less clamping down on hate and lies and more rightists gone wild, whew.\n\nThe plutocrats have already rigged the economy. That’s just the first step. Then you take some of the spoils and reinvest it in buying even more political influence, so that political inequality can help keep economic inequality yawning. You buy up media or social media platforms and thus can help rig the discourse in your favor, taking control of the tools used by regular people to fight back. You venture, as Mr. Musk did, to a TED conference and, without much pushback, brand yourself as a kind of public intellectual, a thought leader, a visionary, and thereby in many people’s minds you became a sage, not a robber baron.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be this way. We can have nice things. But we’re going to have to learn to see through the fraudulent stories that elevate figures like Mr. Musk into heroes. We’re going to have to legislate real guardrails — perhaps like those created by the European Union’s Digital Services Act — on social media platforms that are too big to entrust democracy to.

He added: 'Do you want an edit button?'\n\nApril 5: He joins Twitter's board of directors - sees share price rocket\n\nTwitter said the tech tycoon was joining the company's board of directors, causing the social media platform's shares to rise over 7 per cent in premarket trading.\n\nIt led to speculation he would try to address what he called the platform's 'failure to adhere to free speech principles' and 'fundamentally undermine democracy'.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Musk would have served on the board until the company's 2024 annual shareholders meeting.\n\nAs long as he remains a director, the agreement said, he could not won more than 14.9 percent of the company's stock.\n\nIt meant he would not have been able to take over the company until well after his term on the board was over.\n\nThe firm said: 'Twitter is committed to impartiality in the development and enforcement of its policies and rules.\n\n'Our policy decisions are not determined by the Board or shareholders, and we have no plans to reverse any policy decisions.'\n\n'As always our Board plays an important advisory and feedback role across the entirety of our service.\n\n'Our day to day operations and decisions are made by Twitter management and employees.'\n\nApril 8: Asset managers take over Musk as largest shareholders\n\nAsset manager Vanguard Group increased its stake to overtake Musk as the largest shareholder.\n\nVanguard owned 10.3 percent of Twitter, while the Tesla tycoon owned 9.1 per cent, making him the largest individual shareholder.\n\nVanguard, led by CEO Tim Buckley, increased its stake in the company at some point during the first quarter, according to SEC filings made on April 8.\n\nIt previously reported owning 67.2million shares of Twitter or about 8.4 per cent of the company as of the end of December, according to FactSet.\n\nOther owners of large quantities of Twitter stock included Morgan Stanley, Fidelity and Black Rock.\n\nVanguard, led by CEO Tim Buckley, increased its stake in the company at some point during the first quarter, according to SEC filings made on April 8\n\nApril 9: Musk rejects the offer to join Twitter's board of directors\n\nMusk rejected an offer to join Twitter's board after disclosing his stake in the company.\n\nAnalysts said the move signaled his intention to take over the company as a board seat would have limited his stake to just under 15 per cent.\n\nParag Agrawal said the board would still 'remain open' to Musk's input, but warned: 'There will be distractions ahead but our goals and priorities remain unchanged.'\n\nHe said: 'The board and I had many discussions about Elon joining the board, and with Elon directly. We were excited to collaborate and clear about the risks.\n\n'We also believed that having Elon as a fiduciary of the company where he, like all board members, has to act in the best interests of the company and all our shareholders, was the best path forward. The board offered him a seat.'\n\nAgrawal continued: 'We announced on Tuesday that Elon would be appointed to the board contingent on a background check and formal acceptance.\n\n'Elon's appointment to the board was to become officially effective 4/9, but Elon shared that same morning that he will no longer be joining the board.'\n\nParag Agrawal said the board would still 'remain open' to Musk's input, but warned: 'There will be distractions ahead but our goals and priorities remain unchanged'\n\nApril 12: Twitter shareholder Marc Bain Rasella files suit against Musk\n\nMarc Bain Rasella filed a lawsuit against Musk for alleged securities fraud at a Manhattan federal court, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nThe suit claimed the billionaire was required to disclose his holdings to the SEC by March 24, but the delay kept Twitter's share price down allowing Musk to buy more.\n\nMusk was accused of violating a regulatory deadline to reveal he had accumulated a stake of at least five per cent.\n\nInstead, according to the complaint, Musk did not disclose his position in Twitter until he had almost doubled his stake to more than nine per cent.\n\nThat strategy, the lawsuit alleges, hurt less wealthy investors who sold shares in the company in the nearly two weeks before Musk acknowledged holding a major stake.\n\nApril 14: The Tesla tycoon offers to buy Twitter for $43 BILLION\n\nMusk offered to buy Twitter for $43billion, a regulatory filing showed, as he moved to seize the social media giant.\n\nMusk's offer price of $54.20 per share represented a 38 per cent premium to the closing price of Twitter's stock on April 1.\n\nThis was the last trading day before the Tesla CEO's over nine per cent investment in the company was publicly announced.\n\nIt even appeared to reference marijuana - also known as 420 - a common reference used by Musk on Twitter.\n\nTwitter said in a regulatory filing Musk provided a letter containing a proposal to buy the remaining shares of Twitter he did not already own.\n\nApril 15: Twitter launches 'poison pill' strategy to stop Musk buyout\n\nTwitter's board announced a dramatic poison pill plan to prevent Musk from increasing his stake in the company.\n\nAlso known as a shareholder rights provision, the plan would trigger a dilution of shares if any shareholder builds up a 15 per cent stake without the board's approval.\n\nThe plan did not prevent Twitter from accepting Musk's offer or entering negotiations with him or other potential buyers.\n\nBut it did stop the billionaire from putting pressure on the board by buying up ever more shares on the open market.\n\nMusk hit back with a laughing emoji to a version of the classic 'Distracted Boyfriend' meme mocking Twitter's board.\n\nThe imaged depicted 'Twitter's board' looking wistfully at the option to 'keep that easy gig that gives me shares' as 'Twitter investors' look on with disgust.\n\nTwitter's board is led by chairman Bret Taylor, who is also the co-CEO of business software giant Salesforce\n\nApril 16: Musk tweets Love Me Tender in tease of hostile takeover\n\nMusk tweeted 'Love Me Tender' as he again teased at the possibility of a hostile takeover of Twitter.\n\nThe billionaire posted the Elvis Presley lyrics in a potential bid to lure shareholders with a tender offer that could see him seize control.\n\nA tender offer would see him bypass the board and go to shareholders with his offer of $54.20 a share - but he would need to show how he would finance his bid.\n\nHe also appeared to suggest he would strip board members of their salaries, saying they would get '$0 if my bid succeeds'.\n\nApril 18: Jack Dorsey slams the Twitter board for 'plots and coups'\n\nJack Dorsey slammed the board of Twitter as he weighed into the toxic fight over Elon Musk's attempted hostile takeover for the first time.\n\nThe former CEO, who is still a member of the board himself, blasted the 'plots and coups' that were 'consistently the dysfunction of the company'.\n\nIn a series of bombshell tweets and replies, he endorsed one posting saying that 'a bad board will kill a company every time'.\n\nReplying to one post, he said: 'When I was fired in 2008 and made chair, the board took most of my shares away from me.\n\n'I also gave 1 per cent of the company back to the employee pool in 2015. So, ended up with very little of company.'\n\nHe also replied to one comment mentioning 'plots and coups' in the Twitter board saying: 'it's consistently been the dysfunction of the company'.\n\nEarlier in the thread, he replied to a post quoting a 'Silicon Valley proverb' by venture capitalist Fred Destin.\n\nIt said: 'Good boards don't create good companies, but a bad board will kill a company every time.' Dorsey said: 'Big facts.'\n\nFormer CEO Dorsey slammed Twitter's board of directors on as he replied to a series of unfriendly tweets\n\nApril 21: SpaceX boss unveils his $46.5billion financing package\n\nElon Musk unveiled his $46.5billion financing package to fund his takeover of Twitter - using Tesla as collateral.\n\nThe world's richest man filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission outlining how he would seize the social media giant.\n\nHe committed $21billion in equity, $13billion from Morgan Stanley in debt facilities and another $12.5billion from the bank and others in margin loans.\n\nBut 'a portion' of his shares in Tesla have been put forward as collateral, which analysts feared could have a huge impact on the firm.\n\nThe 50-year-old billionaire also revealed he was weighing up launching a tender offer for Twitter after the company ignored his acquisition offer.\n\nHe said he was exploring getting stocks directly from shareholders but admitted he 'has not determined whether to do so at this time'.\n\nMusk filed the document with the SEC showing how he planned to take over Twitter for about $46.5billion.\n\nHe secured a debt commitment letter from Morgan Stanley Senior Funding to the tune of $13billion in financing.\n\nThis was made up of a loan of $6.5billion, a senior secured revolving facility for $500million, a bridge loan of up to $3billion and an unsecured bridge loan for up to $3billion.\n\nHe also got a margin loan commitment letter from Morgan Stanley for $12.5 billion in margin loans. And Musk also got $21billion through equity financing.\n\nBut he has used 'a portion' of his shares in Tesla as collateral in the high-stakes move, which analysts warned could have huge ramifications for the company.\n\nApril 22: Musk posts 'boner' killer picture of Bill Gates on Twitter\n\nMusk dissed Bill Gates' gut on Twitter, posting a photo of the Microsoft mogul next to Apple's controversial pregnant man emoji 'in case you need to lose a boner.'\n\nHe posted a follow-up image in response to the Friday post of six hooded figured captioned 'shadow ban council reviewing Tweet'.\n\nThe joke could further infuriate woke Twitter staffers angered by Musk's ongoing bid to buy the firm after saying he would support free speech.\n\nThat is because the pregnant man emoji is aimed at being inclusive to transgender people - with Musk frequently taking aim at what he sees as woke overreach.\n\nApril 25: Musk finalizes deal to buy Twitter\n\nMusk was closing in on seizing Twitter as talks between the Tesla magnate and the tech giant entered their final stages, reports say.\n\nThe tycoon's representatives were said to be hammering out terms including a timeline and fees if an agreement was signed and then fell apart.\n\nThe two sides were reportedly working into the early morning to finalize the 'fluid and fast-moving' negotiations.\n\nTwitter shares soared by four percent as the markets opened to $50.84 a share amid reports it would be seized by Musk.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Twitter announced it had 'entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by an entity wholly owned by Elon Musk, for $54.20 per share in cash in a transaction valued at approximately $44 billion. Upon completion of the transaction, Twitter will become a privately held company.'", 'image': 'https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/26/14/57069119-0-image-a-49_1650980561815.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:46'}

TWTR -3.91% will need to follow the bloc’s new rules for tackling illegal and harmful content online if it wants to keep operating there, marking a possible challenge to Elon Musk’s plans to take a more hands-off approach to content moderation.\n\nThierry Breton, EU internal market commissioner, said Tuesday in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that it’s his job to make sure companies, including Twitter, understand their obligations in Europe. That will soon include a series of new obligations for social media and other online platforms, called the Digital Services Act, after lawmakers agreed to the main points of the legislation last week.\n\n“Now we have very clear rules,” Mr. Breton said. “They can do whatever they want outside of Europe…but in Europe they will just have to fulfill [our] rules and obligations.”\n\nThe Digital Services Act aims to force platforms to take more responsibility for the content their users post online. It will introduce a series of obligations for large social-media networks like Twitter, ranging from new standards for taking down illegal content to a requirement to conduct annual risk assessments detailing how they are responding to harmful content that is posted online.\n\nTwitter will become a private company if Elon Musk’s $44 billion takeover bid is approved. The move would allow Musk to make changes to the site. WSJ’s Dan Gallagher explains Musk’s proposed changes and the challenges he might face enacting them. Illustration: Jordan Kranse\n\nThe text of the new law still needs formal approval from the EU Parliament and representatives from EU countries, but it is unlikely to change substantially from what lawmakers agreed to last week.\n\nMr. Breton expressed confidence in a post on Twitter earlier Tuesday that the company under Mr. Musk’s ownership would conform to the EU’s new rules.\n\n“Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules—regardless of their shareholding,” Mr. Breton wrote. “Mr Musk knows this well. He is familiar with European rules on automotive, and will quickly adapt to the Digital Services Act.”\n\nMr. Musk’s purchase of Twitter could mark an eventual test case for the EU’s new legislation once it comes into effect, said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond. While there are questions about whether the European Commission will have the resources to fully enforce the new law, Prof. Tobias said, “I do think [Mr. Musk] is on notice, and Twitter shareholders, too.”\n\nMr. Musk wrote on Twitter Tuesday afternoon that his view of free speech is speech that “matches the law.”\n\n“I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law,” he said. “If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect.”\n\nMr. Breton said the EU was careful in setting its regulations to maintain freedom of speech. He said he had interactions with many platforms during the lawmaking process and was open to meeting with others, in a comment that appeared to be aimed at Mr. Musk. “If any new shareholder of these platforms is willing to engage with me, my door will be totally open, like always,” he said.\n\nThe EU’s new legislation won’t prevent Mr. Musk from taking a more free-speech-oriented approach, said Zach Meyers, a senior research fellow with the Centre for European Reform think tank.

In the wake of this "great deplatforming," Republicans\' longstanding gripes with these platforms became a legislative priority.\n\nOne of the most aggressive of these Republican-led efforts to regulate social media is Texas\' H.B. 20. Ostensibly passed to combat the "dangerous movement by social media companies to silence conservative viewpoints and ideas," this bill prohibits social media platforms from removing users or content "based on the viewpoint" of the user or content. In its effort to protect conservative speech, Texas Republicans have adopted a historically discredited left-wing legal theory, dispensing with core conservative values in the process.\n\nIn the 1960s, a group of progressive scholars argued that the First Amendment does not merely prohibit the government from censoring private speech and press. In fact, they argued, it granted the government the affirmative power to control the mass media. In a capitalist system, they reasoned, the government must ensure that private media owners do not exclude unwelcome viewpoints, in order to protect the "democratic interest" in free speech. To this end, the scholars championed the Fairness Doctrine, right-of-reply mandates, and expansive applications of "common carriage" doctrine, which enable the government to force the inclusion of certain content.\n\nBorrowing from the same playbook, Texas now argues that First Amendment values require, rather than prohibit, government interference with private speech. H.B. 20 declares that social media platforms are common carriers like telephone companies and thus are subject to onerous restrictions over who and what they may host. According to Texas, H.B. 20 serves the democratic interest in protecting the free exchange of ideas and information. But like the collectivist efforts that preceded it, Texas\' misguided attempt to advance "First Amendment rights in the Lone Star State" violates private platforms\' First Amendment rights to choose what speech they publish.\n\nAs we explained in a recently filed amicus curiae brief on behalf of the Cato Institute, courts have repeatedly rejected such regulations, and for good reasons.\n\nFirst, as a federal district court correctly noted last year, the First Amendment protects social media platforms\' discretion to publish or remove content. The Supreme Court established this right in the 1974 case Miami Herald Publishing Company v. Tornillo, when it struck down a Florida law that forced newspapers to print responses to their criticism of political candidates. The Court explained that this "right-of-reply" law infringed on newspapers\' right to choose what content they publish.\n\nThe Supreme Court affirmed that First Amendment rights apply with full force to internet media in 1997\'s Reno v. ACLU. Other federal courts have since upheld the editorial rights of search engines and social media sites. These precedents doom the Texas law. The state can\'t eviscerate platforms\' well-established First Amendment rights by arbitrarily calling them common carriers.\n\nSecond, efforts like H.B. 20 chill, rather than encourage, the exercise of free speech. Both the Florida right-of-reply law and the Fairness Doctrine actually discouraged the media from covering controversial topics that would trigger the forced-hosting requirements. Likewise, H.B. 20 will encourage platforms to ban entire subjects (say, discussions of terrorism) to avoid facing the unappetizing choice to either host objectionable viewpoints (such as pro-terrorism material) or face liability for removing each piece of content.\n\nThird, H.B. 20 violates fundamental property rights by forcing private platforms to host users and content they would otherwise exclude. The First Amendment does not authorize the government to co-opt private property to amplify certain viewpoints.\n\nThe supporters of the Texas law, like other conservative opponents of Big Tech, cite anecdotal accounts of inconsistent content moderation to support their claim of unfair bias. But it\'s more likely that these incidents are just casualties of the margin of error inherent in content moderation at scale. "Incorrect" removals of content happen millions of times per day to users representing every conceivable ideology. Conservatives are removed from platforms when they violate platforms\' terms of service, but Texas\' premise that conservatives are being unfairly targeted is unsubstantiated.\n\nBut even if it was substantiated, forced-hosting laws like H.B. 20 would contravene limited government, constitutional fidelity, and strong property rights, all of which are supposed to be core conservative values. If Texas Republicans really want to protect "conservative viewpoints," they should reacquaint themselves with those principles and reject giving the government more control over social media.', 'image': 'https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2022/04/timothy-hales-bennett-OwvRB-M3GwE-unsplash-scaled.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:31'}

If he lets that man rant and rave on Twitter, not in the best interests of America’s’ future.”\n\nDurbin, who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee, noted that his and other panels are exploring whether it would be appropriate to impose new regulations on Big Tech companies to incentivize them to do more to moderate content.\n\nSpeaking at Stanford last week, Obama said tech firms “need to be more transparent about how they operate” and crack down on “lies and conspiracy theories” that threaten the nation’s democratic system.\n\n“Without some standards, implications of this technology — for our elections, for our legal system, for our democracy, for rules of evidence, for our entire social order — are frightening and profound,” he warned.\n\nMusk hasn’t said whether he’ll let Trump, who was permanently barred from Twitter in January 2021, back on the platform, but his recent comments have fueled speculation that he might do so. Trump has indicated he’s not interested in getting back on Twitter, though he is known for changing his mind.\n\nSen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he also had concerns about what Musk’s purchase of Twitter might mean for the platform’s content standards.\n\nHe said he was looking into the matter but declined to provide any detail.\n\n“I’ve got some concerns. I think it will have to go through … some level of appropriate regulatory [review], and I’m doing some of my own checking,” he said.\n\nSen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) said Musk’s control over a major forum for political debate is alarming.\n\n“It’s always a concern when an oligarch may be owning the town square. I think we do need to pay a lot of attention to how it’s managed,” he said.\n\nMusk’s takeover of Twitter raises questions about what it means for his settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over fraud charges stemming from his August 2018 tweet that he had secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 per share, which pushed the car company’s stock higher.\n\nUnder the settlement, Musk must allow a Tesla lawyer to review any tweets containing material business information before hitting the send button.\n\nSen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), the chairwoman of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, said allowing Trump back on Twitter would be a major problem.\n\n“I think that’s very problematic,” she said of Trump’s possible return. “I don’t think that somebody who encouraged and organized a violent insurrection to take over our government should be allowed on Twitter.”\n\nAsked about the loosening of content standards, she said she “would certainly have concerns” but added she hadn’t looked at the deal closely enough to “get into a big analysis.”\n\nTrump, who has launched a social media venture that includes a platform intended to vie with Twitter, told Fox News on Monday that he doesn’t plan to return to Twitter.\n\n“I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,” he said, referring to his Truth Social messaging platform, before the deal was announced. “I hope Elon buys Twitter because he’ll make improvements to it and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth. The bottom line is, no, I am not going back to Twitter.”\n\nTwitter permanently suspended Trump because of what it called “the risk of further incitement of violence” after a mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to halt the certification of President Biden’s victory.\n\nTwitter later unveiled a civic integrity policy that prohibited the use of its services for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes. It also reserved the right to flag or reduce the visibility of tweets containing false or misleading information about civic processes.\n\nAt a TED conference this month, Musk stressed the importance of allowing free speech on Twitter.\n\n“Twitter has become kind of the de facto town square, so it’s just really important that people have both the reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely within the bounds of the law,” he said.\n\nConservatives on Monday applauded Musk’s move.\n\n“Elon Musk did his part for free speech today. Let’s hope the Supreme Court does as well,” former Rep. Mark Walker (N.C.), a conservative Republican running for Senate, tweeted Monday afternoon.\n\nDemocrats are worried what that means for policing claims that Biden stole the 2020 presidential election or misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n“I’m a big free speech guy, but this stuff isn’t working. It’s terrorizing democracy, and from that perspective I think it’s bad for Democrats in this sense: These Republican alt groups tend to dominate. They tend to have much more of a footprint on these social media platforms than Democrats do,” said Steve Jarding, a Democratic strategist and former senior adviser to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\nJarding is also the communications director for a new social media platform called Pixstory, which has a business model designed to root out hate and misinformation by giving integrity scores to people who post on the site.\n\nBut Jarding called it “a horrible problem” that the world’s richest person is taking over a major means of political discourse at a time when Democrats are discussing proposals to tax the unrealized capital gains of multibillionaires such as Musk to pay for proposals to fight climate change and economic inequality.\n\n“He could turn it into anything that he wants. He controls literally hundreds of millions of hits, if you will, or clicks on a platform that he can determine whether it’s used in a good way or a bad way, and that’s too much concentration with one individual,” Jarding added.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/stabenowdebbie_020922arl.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:10'}

As YouTube celebrates its 17th birthday, the game-changing user-generated video platform once known for funny pet videos and other benign content continues to attract criticism for its alleged role in fostering extremism. Ample evidence casts doubt on the idea that social media platforms are radicalizing American youth, but high-profile anecdotes about bad turns allegedly inspired by YouTube, Facebook, and other sites make it hard to combat such claims. Now one such story may come before the Supreme Court—and threaten a foundational internet speech law.\n\nThe case (Gonzalez v. Google LLC) involves a man whose daughter was killed in a 2015 ISIS attack in Paris. The grieving father, Reynaldo Gonzalez, sued YouTube\'s parent company, Google, under the U.S. Anti-Terrorism Act. Gonzalez claims that ISIS posted recruitment videos on YouTube, that YouTube recommended these videos to users, and that this led to his daughter\'s death.\n\nGonzalez\'s circumstances are tragic, but his claim is convoluted and patently illogical. To buy it, you have to buy the idea that without YouTube, the terrorist group not only would be unable to recruit members but would cease to use existing networks to carry out attacks.\n\nThe Supreme Court has not yet decided whether it will hear Gonzalez\'s case. But if it does, it could give the Court a chance to consider the parameters of Section 230, the federal law preventing internet companies and users from being liable for all third-party speech (and pretty much the backbone of the internet as we know it).\n\nSCOTUSblog notes that in 2020, Justice Clarence Thomas suggested that "in an appropriate case, we should consider whether the text of this increasingly important statute aligns with the current state of immunity enjoyed by Internet platforms." (Thomas made a similar suggestion earlier this year.)\n\n"The petition in Gonzalez v. Google LLC tries to present itself as the case Thomas has been looking for," writes Andrew Hamm:\n\nThe district court dismissed Gonzalez\'s claim on the ground that Section 230 nonetheless protected Google for its recommendations because ISIS produced the videos, not Google. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit affirmed, concluding that Section 230 protects such recommendations, at least if the provider\'s algorithm treated content on its website similarly. However, the panel in Gonzalez considered itself bound to reach this result because of a recent case on the same issue that another 9th Circuit panel decided while Gonzalez was pending. The Gonzalez panel further concluded that, if it could resolve the question itself, Section 230 would not protect a provider\'s content recommendations. Gonzalez admits that the circuits to face this question are not split. Instead, Gonzalez suggests that, had his case simply come out before the other 9th Circuit decision, then Google would be the one seeking review. Regardless, he maintains, the providers\' financial dependence on advertisements and hence on algorithms that can target users makes this question of recommendations important to resolve.\n\nGonzalez is far from the first person to sue social media companies over terrorist acts. But these people "have yet to talk a court into agreeing with their arguments," as Tim Cushing noted at Techdirt last fall.\n\n"The facts in these cases are invariably awful: often people have been brutally killed and their loved ones are seeking redress for their loss. There is a natural, and perfectly reasonable, temptation to give them some sort of remedy from someone, but as we argued in our brief, that someone cannot be an internet platform," wrote constitutional lawyer Cathy Gellis in 2017:\n\nThere are several reasons for this, including some that have nothing to do with Section 230. For instance, even if Section 230 did not exist and platforms could be liable for the harms resulting from their users\' use of their services, for them to be liable there would have to be a clear connection between the use of the platform and the harm.\n\nSection 230 "should prevent a court from ever even reaching the tort law analysis," added Gellis. "With Section 230, a platform should never find itself having to defend against liability for harm that may have resulted from how people used it."\n\nA new study backs up what advocates for Section 230 have been saying for a long time: The law protects small companies and creators more than big tech giants.\n\n"If you understand the mechanisms by which Section 230 actually works, the key is that it gets frivolous and wasteful lawsuits kicked out of court much earlier—when the costs are still intense, but more bearable," points out Mike Masnick in a Techdirt post about the study. "Without Section 230, the end result of the court case may be the same—where the company wins—but the costs would be much, much higher. For Facebook and Google that\'s not going to make a huge difference. But for smaller companies, it can be the difference between life and death."\n\n"Larger enterprises are less impacted by lawsuits," point out the authors of the study, in a report titled "Understanding Section 230 & the Impact of Litigation on Small Providers." A large company "may already have: 1) lawyers ready to deal with lawsuits (allowing the business to continue with minimal disruption); 2) insurance coverage that can offset the cost of a defense, a settlement, or a damage award; and 3) sufficient revenue and cash reserves such that most cases are viewed as a cost of doing business rather than a cataclysmic event."\n\nSmall companies are less likely to have or be able to afford any of these things, making it less likely that they will fight even lawsuits that they would win.\n\nPoliticians, alas, have taken to scapegoating Section 230 for basically anything they or their constituents don\'t like about the internet. And lawyers keep getting creative in their anti–Section 230 arguments, suggesting that while Section 230 may broadly protect internet platforms from liability for many things that users post, the law does not covers various facets of these platforms—their design, their algorithms, etc..\n\nOccasionally, judges appear sympathetic to this. In Taamneh v. Twitter, which the 9th Circuit ruled on last year, Judge Marsha Berzon wrote that Section 230 protects "only traditional activities of publication and distribution—such as deciding whether to publish, withdraw, or alter content—and does not include activities that promote or recommend content or connect content users to each other. I urge this Court to reconsider our precedent en banc to the extent that it holds that section 230 extends to the use of machine-learning algorithms to recommend content and connections to users."\n\n"This is a really weird, really dangerous place to start drawing the line in Section 230 lawsuits," wrote Tim Cushing last summer. "Algorithms react to input from users. If YouTube can\'t be held directly responsible for videos uploaded by users, it makes sense it would be immunized against algorithmically suggesting content based on users\' actions and preferences. The algorithm does next to nothing on its own without input from content viewers. It takes a user to really get it moving."\n\nFREE MINDS\n\nA federal appeals court has rejected a university\'s ban on "discriminatory harassment." The University of Central Florida\'s "discriminatory harassment" ban likely violates the First Amendment, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals said. The case is Speech First, Inc. v. Cartwright, and you can read the whole ruling here. In essence, the court found the school\'s policy against allegedly discriminatory speech to be too broad:\n\n[T]he policy (1) prohibits a wide range of "verbal, physical, electronic, and other" expression concerning any of (depending on how you count) some 25 or so characteristics; (2) states that prohibited speech "may take many forms, including verbal acts, name-calling, graphic or written statements" and even "other conduct that may be humiliating"; (3) employs a gestaltish "totality of known circumstances" approach to determine whether particular speech, for instance, "unreasonably alters" another student\'s educational experience; and (4) reaches not only a student\'s own speech, but also her conduct "encouraging," "condoning," or "failing to intervene" to stop another student\'s speech. The policy, in short, is staggeringly broad, and any number of statements—some of which are undoubtedly protected by the First Amendment—could qualify for prohibition under its sweeping standards. To take a few obvious examples, the policy targets "verbal, physical, electronic or other conduct" based on "race," "ethnicity," "religion [or] non-religion," "sex," and "political affiliation." Among the views that Speech First\'s members have said they want to advocate are that "abortion is immoral," that the government "should not be able to force religious organizations to recognize marriages with which they disagree," that "affirmative action is deeply unfair," that "a man cannot become a woman because he \'feels\' like one," that "illegal immigration is dangerous," and that "the Palestinian movement is anti-Semitic."\n\nIn a concurring opinion, Judge Stanley Marcus warned against "the grave peril posed by a policy that effectively polices adherence to intellectual dogma."\n\n"History provides us with ample warning of those times and places when colleges and universities have stopped pursuing truth and have instead turned themselves into cathedrals for the worship of certain dogma," wrote Marcus. "By depriving itself of academic institutions that pursue truth over any other concern, a society risks falling into the abyss of ignorance. Humans are not smart enough to have ideas that lie beyond challenge and debate."\n\nThe Volokh Conspiracy has more on the ruling (which includes the lovely line "the state is a really big boy") here.\n\nFREE MARKETS\n\nPrivate space mission on its way back to earth. The first privately-funded trip to the International Space Station started its return trip yesterday. More from CNN:\n\nThe mission, called AX-1, was brokered by the Houston, Texas-based startup Axiom Space, which books rocket rides, provides all the necessary training, and coordinates flights to the ISS for anyone who can afford it. The four crew members—Michael López-Alegría, a former NASA astronaut-turned-Axiom employee who is commanding the mission; Israeli businessman Eytan Stibbe; Canadian investor Mark Pathy; and Ohio-based real estate magnate Larry Connor—left the space station aboard their SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule on Sunday at 9:10 pm EST….They will spend about one day free flying through orbit before plummeting back into the atmosphere and parachuting to a splashdown landing off the coast of Florida around 1 pm ET Monday. AX-1, which launched on April 8, was originally billed as a 10-day mission, but delays extended the mission by about a week.\n\nThis isn\'t the first time private citizens have been able to pay for seats on spacecraft. "But AX-1 is the first mission with a crew entirely comprised of private citizens with no active members of a government astronaut corps accompanying them in the capsule during the trip to and from the ISS," reports CNN. "It\'s also the first time private citizens have traveled to the ISS on a US-made spacecraft."\n\nAnd it\'s also a powerful reminder that perhaps the next era of space exploration needn\'t be government funded and managed.\n\nQUICK HITS\n\n• Air Force Major General William T.

Musk haters have taken to the site to declare that Donald Trump will now probably win the 2024 election, that Musk\'s bid is really about white power, that Section 230 must be reformed, and that, yes, Musk\'s new policies will be lethal. (Perhaps the death toll will be even larger than net neutrality\'s!)\n\nSo, for users of the platform, what\'s likely to change?\n\nMusk has panned the site\'s existing content moderation policies, saying they are too restrictive and encroach on people\'s ability to speak freely without being censored. Some liberalization of these policies and the re-platforming of controversial figures like former President Donald Trump—who was banned in the wake of the January 6 riot for inciting violence among his fans—seems likely, though unpopular with droves of users.\n\nAt the mid-April TED conference in Vancouver, Musk talked about his interest in making Twitter\'s algorithm open-source. The Diff\'s Byrne Hobart took this a step further, outlining how "Twitter should monetize a protocol rather than run an app," and explaining the tension between Twitter as a consumer product and as "a way for individual users to update a universal shared database, which can then be filtered based on who\'s interested in what." Hobart claims that it\'s possible that Twitter has been "radically miss-monetized," and that Musk could potentially realign its priorities. However, little of the online discourse has focused on the technical possibilities.\n\nThe new Twitter owner has, through coy tweets, hinted that his new policies will not be applied arbitrarily and that consistent application will mean some number of right-wing users currently cheering his new ownership will surely be disappointed:\n\nI hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 25, 2022\n\nA social media platform\'s policies are good if the most extreme 10% on left and right are equally unhappy — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 19, 2022\n\nElsewhere, Musk has said that Twitter is a "town square" or "public square," and that banning people from using the platform effectively prevents them from participating in the important discussions of the day.\n\nThough people who care about fostering a culture of free speech may agree with the tenor of Musk\'s comments, the analogy is a terrible one. For most of America, the public square is the school board meeting and the town council meeting. There are also numerous other privates spaces for civic engagement: the church pulpit and the post-sermon fray it inspires; neighborhood listservs and the cesspool that is NextDoor; or maybe it\'s Facebook, in-person conversations, and email lists. For many millions of Americans, Twitter is not integral to hashing out values, concerns, and disagreements. Think of the implications if we expected the government to treat such companies—which have their own terms of service and standards that they are free to decide and we are free to consent to—as something akin to public utilities.\n\nIf anything, the new owner of a social media company should convey an inflated sense of the platform\'s worth! But Musk has at times, despite his forceful defense of free speech culture on the internet, repeated confused talking points that indicate scattered thinking while simultaneously failing to fully flesh out what day-to-day operations will look like. For example, a lot of content moderation involves the unsexy—and not very ideological—challenge of keeping spam under control. And, as Mike Masnick points out at Techdirt, Musk doesn\'t seem to have a particularly robust understanding of "hate speech" and how much of what we call hate speech is, in fact, protected by the First Amendment.\n\nA lot remains to be seen about how Twitter will change and what Musk will bring to the table. Optimism, with some reservations about Musk\'s ability to execute, seems warranted. Hysteria—like declaring that it\'s now open season for white supremacists, that Musk\'s vision for free speech will be "lethal," or that Musk is an echo of imperialist, colonizer forebears because he wants to go to Mars—is not.', 'image': 'https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2022/04/thumbnail-9-3.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:46'}

Musk paid $44 billion to acquire the social media platform with the stated aim of turning it into a haven for "free speech."\n\nThe web is awash in speculation over what that means. Conservatives and people booted off the platform have pushed for Musk to reinstate banned accounts, including that of former President Donald Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, prominent Twitter figures are now saying they\'ll leave the platform in protest of its new owner. Among them is English actress Jameela Jamil, who tweeted her fears Monday that Musk "is going to help this hell platform reach its final form of totally lawless hate, bigotry, and misogyny."\n\nIt\'s unclear whether Musk will be able to realize all his plans for Twitter. The tech leader has floated less moderation, less advertising and an open-source algorithm. But Musk\'s stated ideals contradict his own actions.\n\nWhat Musk says he wants\n\nMusk has made clear he wants less moderation — which he considers censorship — on the platform.\n\n"Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated," he said in Monday\'s announcement about the acquisition.\n\nHe also said he wants to defeat the "spambots," or automated accounts that mimic real users; open the algorithm to public inspection and "authenticate all humans" using the platform.\n\nMusk laid out a definition of speech in a TED interview last week.\n\n"A good sign as to whether there is free speech is, is someone you don\'t like allowed to say something you don\'t like? If that is the case, we have free speech," he said.\n\nMusk said Twitter would abide by national laws that restrict speech around the world. Beyond that, he said, he\'d be "very reluctant" to delete posts or permanently ban users who violate the company\'s rules.\n\nHe had previously criticized Trump\'s ban from social media in the wake of the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Twitter and Facebook permanently banned Trump\'s account on the grounds that he incited violence.\n\n"A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech," Musk tweeted days after Trump was banned from both Facebook and Twitter.\n\nHow Musk responds to disagreement\n\nMusk\'s own history, however, puts in doubt his commitment to let people he doesn\'t like speak. As the newsletter Popular Information has documented, Musk has regularly blocked users who criticize him or Tesla; threatened pro-union Tesla employees and company whistleblowers; and has aggressively gone after short-sellers and journalists who are critical of Tesla, sometimes calling their work "false" or "misleading."\n\nIn 2018, he launched a vendetta against Linette Lopez, an Insider journalist critical of Tesla, a move which writer Felix Salmon called "obsessive and deranged."\n\nMusk\'s popular tweets typically send a swarm of his social media fans directly to the accounts of reporters to harass them for hours or days.\n\nSome academics say that Musk\'s hands-off approach threatens to bring Twitter to its bad old days, when harassment and abuse were rampant.\n\n"With Musk, his posturing of free speech — just leave everything up — that would be bad in and of itself," said Paul Barrett, the deputy director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University. "If you stop moderating — with automated systems and human reviews — a site like Twitter, in the space of a short period of time, you would have a cesspool."\n\nSome former Twitter employees are also dismayed by Musk\'s successful bid for the company.\n\n"Twitter is going to let a man-child essentially take over their platform," said Leslie Miley, a former Twitter employee who has also worked for Google and Apple. Miley, who was the only Black engineer at Twitter in a leadership position when he left the company in 2015, echoed doubts shared by others about Musk\'s grasp of the platform\'s complexities.\n\n"I am not sure if Elon knows what he is getting," Miley said. "He may just find that having Twitter is a lot different than wanting Twitter."\n\nUnfettered expression does not attract advertisers\n\nA decade ago, a Twitter executive called the company "the free speech wing of the free speech party," underscoring its commitment to untrammeled freedom of expression. But the company reversed itself after reports of online abuse and harassment became frequent.\n\nIn the U.S., a visceral 2014 article by journalist Amanda Hess exposed the incessant, vile harassment many women faced just for posting on Twitter or other online forums. Twitter also learned about the consequences of an unmoderated social platform: mainly, that it undercut their funding from advertisers.\n\nAds are how Twitter makes money, and companies generally don\'t want their ads running against violent threats, hate speech that bleeds into incitement or incendiary information aimed at tipping elections or undermining public health.\n\nGoogle, Barrett pointed out, quickly learned this lesson the hard way when major companies like Toyota and Anheuser-Busch yanked their ads after they ran ahead of YouTube videos produced by extremists in 2015.\n\nOnce it was clear just how unhealthy the conversation had gotten, Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey spent years trying to improve what he called the "health" of the conversation on the platform.\n\nThe company was an early adopter of the "report abuse" button after U.K. member of parliament Stella Creasy received a barrage of rape and death threats on the platform. The online abuse was the result of a seemingly positive tweet in support of feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez, who successfully advocated for novelist Jane Austen to appear on a British banknote. Creasy\'s online harasser was sent to prison for 18 weeks.\n\nTwitter has continued to craft rules and invest in staff and technology that detected violent threats, harassment and misinformation that violated its policies. After evidence emerged that Russia used Twitter\'s platforms to try to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election, social media companies stepped up their efforts against political misinformation. All have struggled with defining "misinformation," however, and been accused of both leaving up false content as well as over-censoring legitimate posts.\n\nHard to unwind moderation\n\nThe big question now is how far Musk wants to ratchet back these systems — and whether users and advertisers will stick around if he does.\n\nLike Miley, the former Twitter engineer, experts who have studied content moderation and researched Twitter express doubt that Musk knows what he is getting into. After all, there are plenty of fledgling examples of so-called free speech-focused platforms that have been launched in the past few years as Twitter alternatives, largely by conservatives unhappy with the Twitter\'s crackdown on hate, harassment and misinformation. Many such sites have struggled to deal with toxic content, and at least one has been cut off by its own technology providers in protest.\n\n"This move just shows how effective (moderation features) have been to annoy those in power," said Kirsten Martin, a professor of technology ethics at the University of Notre Dame. "I would be worried as to how this would change Twitter\'s values."\n\nThe fact that no other bidders emerged in public before Musk\'s deal was a sign that other would-be acquirers might find Twitter too difficult to improve, said Third Bridge analyst Scott Kessler.\n\n"This platform is pretty much the same one we\'ve had over the last decade or so," Kessler said. "You\'ve had a lot of smart people trying to figure out what they should do, and they\'ve had trouble. It\'s probably going to be tough to make a lot of headway."\n\nEven now, Americans say they\'re more likely to be harassed on social media than any other online forum, with women, people of color and LGBTQ users reporting a disproportionate amount of that abuse. Roughly 80% of users believe the companies are still doing only a "fair or poor" job of handling that harassment, according to a Pew Research Center survey of U.S. adults last year.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/04/30/39aaad79-fd57-40fa-b203-bc4143cf40f2/thumbnail/1200x630g8/aef00fb0dcf931880dd52af0a50dc345/gettyimages-1206290121.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:24'}

In Canada, vaccine-free Canadians still cannot board a train or a plane and travel from one region of the country to another.\n\nIn Canada, air and train travel are regulated by the federal government, even when you travel within the same province. The feds have made it so only a vaccine passport, or very limited jab exemptions, will afford you the opportunity to visit family, friends, or travel for work.\n\nThis means that if you lived in, let’s say, Kitchener, Ontario, you could not get on a VIA Rail train and travel to Toronto… even though you could travel from Kitchener to Toronto on a commuter train that is not under federal jurisdiction.\n\nIsn’t “science” wonderful!\n\nOh, and vaccine-free Canadians also can’t LEAVE the country. Unjabbed Canadians are told they can’t “put others at risk” by boarding a plane with vaccinated people (because vaccines suddenly…work?). Apparently, it is good for the unvaccinated to stay in Canada, even though … they are risk to everyone else who is protected by a vaccine?\n\nTrudeau’s insecurity on display\n\nNow, on the one hand it is quite easy to understand why Trudeau is acting like an evil dictator: he has proven himself to be an immoral tyrant on many occasions. However, given the fact that other leftist tyrants have eased up, it is clearly not just leftism or progressivism that causing him to trap Canadians indefinitely in their home like real-life versions of The Truman Show. (How fitting that it was Canadian Jim Carrey who starred in that film.)\n\nThere is something unique about Trudeau that is causing him to become “regressive” as the rest of the leftist dominated West is affording vaccine-free citizens their civil rights.\n\nTo the outside world, Trudeau may look like a confident – if not cringeworthy – tin-pot dictator, but in reality, he is a 50-year-old boy with little to no virtue. He is essentially a spoiled teenager who can remember lines and present himself well in a tailored suit and has a family name that tricked people into thinking he was competent.\n\nHis (Canadian) father, Pierre Trudeau, for all his faults, was shrewd and intelligent – even if evil. Justin Trudeau is evil and unintelligent and quite obtuse.\n\nI can’t help but think he believes he must prove himself as being his own verified dictator in order to fill his daddy’s shoes. Simply put, he is insecure and projecting.\n\n— Article continues below Petition — PETITION: Ask Elon Musk to REINSTATE LifeSite\'s Twitter accounts Show Petition Text 7936 have signed the petition.

Sign this Petition Please SIGN and SHARE this petition to the new owner of Twitter, Elon Musk, asking him to reinstate LifeSiteNews\' truth-telling Twitter accounts which have been suspended since early 2021. After contentious negotiations, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has purchased Twitter, thereby transforming the tech giant into a private company. A self-styled "free speech absolutist," Mr. Musk\'s entrepreneurial spirit may define his approach to governing Twitter, where, in the marketplace of ideas, the best ideas - not those aided by censorship - will naturally prevail among the competition. Of course, there are limits to free speech. But, for too long, Big Tech giants (including, Twitter, Google, YouTube and Facebook) have subjected their conservative and Christian users to all forms of censorship, desperately trying to silence our voices. So if, as it seems, Mr. Musk will level the playing field for conservatives and Christians and allow a true exchange of ideas to occur on his platform, then we look forward to our chance to re-engage on Twitter. Please SIGN and SHARE this petition to the new owner of Twitter, Elon Musk, asking him to reactivate LifeSiteNews\' truth-telling Twitter accounts which have been suspended since early 2021. They are: https://twitter.com/LifeSite\n\nhttps://twitter.com/LSNCatholic\n\nhttps://twitter.com/WCDM_LSN\n\nhttps://twitter.com/WCEA_LSN These accounts have been blocked by the outgoing Twitter regime for more than a year for calling a ‘transgender woman’ (Assistant Secretary of Health, \'Rachel\' Levine), a man, and for tweeting an article about the same person. The article we tweeted makes mention of the troubling paradox of having a person who denies the basic science of the human anatomy be in an authoritative position in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), but does not cast aspersions or any other such “hate speech” against Levine, according to Twitter’s "rules." It is our fervant hope that Mr. Musk intends to allow - rather than censor - our descriptions of reality as we know them to be true in regards to human sexuality, as well as in other areas of life. Mr. Musk evidently understands how significant freedom of speech is to the functioning of a free society as he was quoted as saying that this deal is important for "the future of civlization." LifeSiteNews believes that being able to spread the truth in charity is absolutely vital for the future of society, as the "truth shall make you free." (Jn 8:32) And so, in order for us to charitably spread the truth far and wide, we now seek to re-engage on Twitter\'s public square.

The New Democrats have cozied up to Trudeau in order to pretend they are a sane and legitimate party and have promised to prop up his regime. Promises don’t really mean anything when politicians make them, so we shouldn’t assume that the communists will be loyal to each other.\n\nHowever, it is obvious that public opinion is against Trudeau to a degree that he will not be able to withstand.\n\nThere is a reason why Trudeau had to resort to the Emergencies Act to squash the Freedom Convoy; no one wanted to stop it until they were forced to by law.\n\nThe various levels of provincial and municipal governance could have stopped the movement the way they stop any non-violent protest – but they didn’t want to.\n\nDoes this mean that the cops and all the citizens supported the convoy? Of course not, but I think that enough of them saw how absurd things have become and just wanted something to make the whole charade of 2020-2021-2022 go away.\n\nThe application of the Emergencies Act was wildly unpopular among Canadians, both on the Left and the Right. Leftists were happy to see the movement end but were unimpressed that Trudeau ended it in such an absurd way. Conservatives generally supported the movement, and therefore saw Trudeau as a complete lunatic for doing what he did.\n\nAll of this means that in the long run Trudeau is hurting his reputation, even among his base. This is not news for him as the Conservative leadership race heats up.\n\nFreedom is on the move\n\nWithout giving the impression that I think Canada is on the brink of some massive societal restoration, I would be remiss if I did not speak to the positives.\n\nCurrently, we are witnessing the first real Conservative leadership race in a long time. Pierre Pollievre is filling arenas and convention centres with freedom-loving crowds, and Leslyn Lewis is making leftist journalists look silly on national TV. It is worth remembering that we are talking about a leadership race, not an election, but the swell of right-wing uprising is palpable.\n\nIn fact, the last time something like this happened was after a groundswell of Christian/right-wing sentiment following years of leftist oppression under the former Trudeau and his successors.\n\nAs a result of that, we had Stephen Harper for a decade who, although not perfect, was a saint compared with Trudeau.\n\nThe economy is tanking in Canada, and goods and services are becoming prohibitively expensive for average people. Trudeau and his cronies can appeal to idealism and progressivism all they want, but even left-wingers get ticked off and want change when they are struggling to fill the tank.\n\nUltimately, Trudeau is continuing to trap vaccine-free Canadians from participating fully in society because he knows that if he pulls the plug on his last failing restriction, that his regime will go down the drain.\n\nKennedy Hall is an Ontario based journalist for LifeSiteNews.

Jody Hice (R-Ga.), in all caps. A Twitter survey by Sen. Ted Cruz asked if Musk’s purchase was a good thing, with the only options to answer being “yes” or “no, I hate free speech.” His fellow Texan, Rep. John Carter, signaled his approval with no words at all; three clapping-hands emojis were sufficient.\n\nA pot-smoking, meme-posting evangelist for electric vehicles may be an unlikely hero for conservatives. But the Tesla chief executive’s amorphous vow to restore free speech to the social media platform has resonated among Republicans, who see themselves — starting with their de facto leader, former President Trump — as unfairly targeted by Twitter’s content moderation efforts.\n\nConservatives said their euphoric outpouring was bigger than the possible return of @RealDonaldTrump and changes to Twitter’s ownership. Rather, they see Musk’s takeover as a symbolic, and cathartic, blow against Big Tech, which the right has increasingly viewed with antipathy.\n\n“There’s a gut reaction from a lot of people, going, ‘You know what, it’s about time they get their comeuppance,’ ” said Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.). “It finally feels like someone is standing up for a principle that has been going in an opposite direction lately: less free speech, less ability to express yourself — if you are a conservative.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk centered his bid for Twitter on the premise that the social media company, which he considers a “digital town square,” is too restrictive in clamping down on expression.\n\n“I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” Musk tweeted Monday morning.\n\nMusk’s own politics are idiosyncratic. He’s the foremost face of clean vehicles who called for immediately increasing oil and gas production after the Ukraine-Russia war spiked energy prices. He fled California for Texas because of high taxes but declined to weigh in on Texas’ restrictive abortion law, saying he preferred to “stay out of politics.” He has described himself as politically independent and registered to vote in California with no party preference.\n\nFor conservatives, Musk’s crusade against content restrictions has struck a chord. Roughly half of Republicans feel they cannot express themselves freely on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, according to a Morning Consult poll conducted this month, far exceeding the percentage of Democrats and independents who felt similarly.\n\nPolitics Who did Twitter ban during the Trump era, and why? Could banned Trump allies return to Twitter under Elon Musk? A look at the former president’s backers who were kicked off the social media platform.\n\n“Twitter is a platform that I and many others believe has been more aggressive in blocking Republicans and conservatives than they have toward people on the left,” said Rep. Austin Scott (R-Ga.). “I’m hoping and expecting he will undo that.”\n\nScott is not an avid Twitter user; he does not even have the app on his phone. But he did tweet a congratulatory message to Musk, adding a plea to “restore free speech and bring back President Trump!”\n\nTrump was permanently kicked off the platform on Jan. 8, 2021 — two days after a group of his supporters overran the U.S. Capitol in hopes of blocking the certification of Joe Biden’s win. Twitter imposed the ban “due to the risk of further incitement of violence.”\n\nSo far, Musk has not indicated how he’d handle the former president’s account. Trump, meanwhile, has shown no interest in rejoining the platform that helped power his political rise and gave real-time narration of his presidency.\n\n“I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,” Trump told Fox News, referring to his fledgling social media network. “I hope Elon buys Twitter, because he’ll make improvements to it, and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth.”\n\nRepublicans see Trump as just one example of Twitter’s bias. A number of high-profile conservatives have been suspended or blocked from the platform, including the account of the Babylon Bee, a satirical news website that was suspended for a tweet naming Assistant Health Secretary Rachel Levine, who is transgender, “Man of the Year.”\n\nThe account was locked as a violation of Twitter’s ban on hate speech. Seth Dillon, CEO of Babylon Bee, refused to remove the tweet, asserting that “truth is not hate speech.”\n\n“It’s completely broken,” said Harmeet Dhillon, a conservative lawyer who has sued Twitter multiple times on behalf of clients who were banned. “The company can try to affect elections, try to ban politicians from speaking ... use algorithms, enable false accounts to constantly affect what people see.”\n\nThe extent to which conservatives face bias on the platform has been fiercely examined and debated. A study this month by researchers at MIT and Yale found that Republican users tend to be suspended more often than Democrats but that conservatives are more likely to share misinformation that would provoke such suspensions.\n\nSo far, Musk has offered little explanation as to how his free speech values would play out in practice. He said on Monday that his goals include “enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots and authenticating all humans.”\n\nBut such efforts would require some attempt at regulating content, especially by verifying users. A social media network without any moderation at all could swamp the platform with all sorts of unsavory or offensive material, such as pornography or terrorist content, as well as the online abuse and harassment that are already common occurrences.\n\n“If you don’t have content moderation, you actually have less free speech. The people who are the loudest are the bullies and harassers that drive people away,” said Katie Harbath, a former Republican operative who has worked as public policy director for Facebook.\n\nDhillon, the conservative attorney based in California, said she is not hoping for Musk to completely abandon regulation.\n\n“There’s plenty of room for them to do old-school content moderation of the kind they originally did,” she said, citing as an example prohibitions on making death threats.\n\nWith Musk’s plans still unknown, Harbath, who now runs a tech policy strategy firm, said the celebratory conservatives “are making a hell of a lot of assumptions of what Elon means by all this stuff. I don’t think they should assume he is completely on their side.”\n\nRepublicans’ triumphant tone on Twitter starkly contrasted with the more muted reaction from liberal politicians. Far fewer Democratic members of Congress weighed in on Twitter, although those who did were markedly unenthused.\n\n“This deal is dangerous for our democracy. Billionaires like Elon Musk play by a different set of rules than everyone else, accumulating power for their own gain. We need a wealth tax and strong rules to hold Big Tech accountable,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), with whom Musk has sparred on Twitter.\n\nHuizenga, the Michigan congressman, expected that liberals would be none too pleased with Musk’s purchase. Indeed, some vowed to leave the site entirely — much to Huizenga’s amusement.\n\n“It seems like ‘I’m quitting Twitter’ has become the ‘I’m moving to Canada if Trump wins,’ ” he said, adding, “It’s kind of fun sitting back, watching them completely lose their collective minds.”', 'image': 'https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ac14b68/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2941x1544+0+208/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F86%2F23%2Ff46440b54bd7a6509db9c67caab5%2Fphilanthropy-billionaries-tax-28080.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:57'}

(Patrick Pleul/Pool/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nElon Musk Reveals More Details of His Plans for Twitter After Buyout\n\nElon Musk revealed more details of what he has in mind for changes at Twitter after it was confirmed that the company had accepted his buyout offer, with the tech mogul’s plans including new features and ways to enhance trust in the platform.\n\nTwitter’s board of directors said on April 25 that it had approved Musk’s offer to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share in cash, in a deal worth around $44 billion.\n\nThe buyout represents a 38 percent premium over Twitter’s closing stock price on April 1, with Parag Agrawal, CEO of Twitter, saying in a statement that he believes the deal “is the best path forward for Twitter’s stockholders.”\n\n‘Bedrock of a Functioning Democracy’\n\nIn a statement, Musk provided some details about what kind of changes he has in mind for the social media platform, whose commitment to free speech he has repeatedly called into question.\n\n“Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,” Musk said. This dovetails with his earlier statements that Twitter functions as a “de facto town square” where important conversations should be able to take place with as few constraints as possible.\n\nMusk said Monday that Twitter has “tremendous potential” and that he wants to work with the company and its users to “unlock” and make the platform “better than ever.”\n\nHe said he plans on “enhancing” Twitter with new features, which he did not provide further details on. Musk earlier created a Twitter poll asking users if they want an edit button on the platform, suggesting that this could be one of the changes he is seeking to effect.\n\nMusk also said on Monday he wants to make the platform’s algorithms “open source to increase trust,” while “defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.”\n\nThis, too, reinforces his earlier remarks that his objective in seeking to buy Twitter and turn it into a private company was to transform it into a bastion of free speech by opening up its algorithm to public scrutiny and by making its moderation policies more transparent.\n\n‘Black Box Algorithm’\n\nA self-described “free speech absolutist,” Musk told the audience at a recent TED event in Vancouver, Canada, that Twitter should permit unconstrained expression, though it should do so in line with the law.\n\n“In my view, Twitter should match the laws of the country,” Musk said, acknowledging reasonable legal caps on free speech like direct incitement to violence or shouting “fire” in a crowded theater.\n\n“But going beyond that and having it be unclear who’s making what changes to where, having tweets mysteriously be promoted and demoted with no insight into what’s going on, having a black box algorithm promote some things and not other things, I think this can be quite dangerous,” Musk said.\n\n“My strong, intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization,” he added.\n\nErr on Side of Free Speech\n\nMusk also expressed reluctance about permanent bans of users from Twitter, preferring instead temporary “time-outs.”\n\n“I’m not saying that I have all the answers here,” Musk said at the TED talk. But I do think that we want to be just very reluctant to delete things, just be very cautious with permanent bans. Timeouts I think are better than permanent bans.”\n\nIn terms of calibrating Twitter’s moderation policies, Musk said he’d want to err on the side of free speech.\n\n“If in doubt, let the speech, let it exist,” Musk said. “If it’s a grey area, I would say let the tweet exist. But obviously in a case where there’s perhaps a lot of controversy, that you would not want to necessarily promote that tweet.”\n\n“A good sign as to whether there’s free speech is, is someone you don’t like allowed to say something you don’t like,” Musk said. “And if that is the case, then we have free speech.”\n\n‘We Are Concerned’\n\nMusk has repeatedly questioned Twitter’s commitment to free speech, after accusations that the platform suppressed some minority and politically conservative viewpoints, claims Twitter has denied.\n\nMany free speech advocates have hailed Musk’s takeover bid, while those opposed have expressed fear that fewer constraints on expression on Twitter will make it too easy to abuse the platform’s reach and power by, for example, spreading disinformation.\n\nIn a series of tweets reacting to Musk’s takeover moves, Amnesty International expressed concern about the erosion of policies meant to protect users.\n\n“We are concerned with any steps that Twitter might take to erode enforcement of the policies and mechanisms designed to protect users,” Amnesty International wrote.\n\n“The last thing we need is a Twitter that wilfully turns a blind eye to violent and abusive speech against users,” the group said.\n\nAs it was confirmed Musk would purchase Twitter, the Tesla founder urged his “worst critics” to stay on the platform.\n\n“I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” he wrote in a Twitter post.\n\nDan Ives, an analyst at investment firm Wedbush Securities, told the BBC that he expects most users will take a “wait-and-see approach” on whether they stay or leave the platform, based on the changes that take place.\n\n“Now it’s about courting new users and stopping defectors from the platform,” Ives told the outlet.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/19/article-image-cal-thomas-3-1200x804.jpeg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:50'}

This feels like the first flashback scene we see in a dystopian drama after the words “SIX MONTHS EARLIER …” Quite where we’ll be in six months’ time as far as Twitter is concerned remains tantalisingly unclear, but it seems difficult to imagine it will be either a more or less pleasant space. It’s a social media platform. I’m not sure what further evidence humanity needs before we cotton on to the idea that such a thing might be an intrinsically toxic concept. Of course, there will always be some people who think it just hasn’t been done right yet. Like communism, or a British version of The Daily Show.\n\nAnyway, if Musk’s takeover goes through, he’ll assume control of a platform where the people on the right are incredibly angry about free speech, and those on the left are incredibly angry about hate speech. Which is to say: they have so much in common. As the tech visionary Jaron Lanier has long been excellent at pointing out, the best way to keep people on platforms is to make them angry. So the platforms are designed to make them angry. You might consider the anger worth it for your version of advertising (I myself will post this column on Twitter), but even then it is a weirdly grim cost of doing business that just conceivably ought to be weighed far more carefully than it is.\n\nUnlike the UK, Musk manufactures other things besides anger, but Twitter is the platform where, in a single calendar year, his posts led to multiple lawsuits, a fall in his stock price, and a Securities and Exchange Commission settlement that resulted in his chairmanship of Tesla being forcibly ended. Yet in a move that will feel familiar to a lot of Twitter users, he has not logged off, but leaned in further. When I was a child, there was a guy called Victor Kiam who owned Remington, and he would personally feature in the firm’s electric razor adverts, going: “I liked the shaver so much, I bought the company.” It would be nice to see Musk do something similar. “I liked calling innocent people paedos so much, I bought the company.”\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the distress of Twitter users feels overplayed. Perhaps Elon embodies a kind of radical honesty and self-awareness not shared by other denizens of the site. People who seem to spend half their lives complaining about Twitter, on Twitter, seem stunned by the idea that a shitposter would ultimately buy it. Catch up! It doesn’t feel like a complete coincidence that all social media platforms are owned by men you’d run a mile from socially.\n\nMusk is one of them – a brilliant, horrid, ridiculous and very occasionally endearing grotesque. A sort of intergalactically successful Dominic Cummings. And yet, despite Elon’s give-a-toss gift for making himself what Twitter users might call the “main character”, I can’t detest him entirely. If he pulls off the radical green energy transition embodied in Tesla, or even just one of his other wildly ambitious schemes, humans might have to accept some of the shit that’s gone with it. Accept it angrily, of course – how else, we’re on a social media platform! – but accept it nonetheless. A huge number of other people in public life behave appallingly and achieve absolutely nothing but harm.\n\nBut if endlessly righteous folk balk at the mere idea of necessary evils, why do they act like their own involvement in Twitter is one? It isn’t. It’s easy to focus on the high-profile people who are always on Twitter. But the sheer numbers of highly successful, highly creative and highly interesting people in the worlds of arts, business, science and beyond who AREN’T on it should tell a much more powerful story. They are part of all kinds of era-defining creative and commercial conversations and breakthroughs – and somehow manage to do it all without lavishing half the day scrolling past a bunch of other people having a row.\n\nLanier has cast detailed doubt on whether most Twitter advocacy is even meaningfully effective, despite sometimes appearing to be so. If you spend your day caught up in online fighting, it’s preferable to tell yourself you’re involved in consciousness-raising for your cause. An alternative view is that you are simply obsessively polarising your particular debate, to the point where compromise – boring, unfashionable, yet historically always necessary – becomes a more distant possibility.\n\nMy “unpopular opinion”, in one of Twitter’s tellingly popular phrases, is that those who spend a significant amount of time arguing on it work for the platform and not for their cause. The Musk takeover at least makes it easier to see whose pocket you’re putting money into as you delude yourself you’re winning arguments. I’m certainly not saying I follow this rule, but in general I think arguing on the internet is like playing real tennis: even if you win, you’re still a twat.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5899b28a3a52d992407b1aa95d2689c2b1d4703f/0_273_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=e4d7eefe6e510bd81cf93360935a1d81', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:53'}

After news of Musk’s takeover, news website Politico contacted several top Republican members and aides to gauge reaction to a potential Trump Twitter return.\n\n“Every single one of them told us that they hoped the former president stays the hell away from Twitter,” Politico reported.\n\nTrump himself has said he won’t be back, telling Fox News: “I am going to be staying on Truth.”\n\nThe twice-impeached former commander-in-chief is not known for his consistency, however. He has reportedly expressed discontent with how Truth Social has performed – “What the fuck is going on,” the Daily Beast reported Trump as asking aides in March – and to return to relevance, and to win back the spotlight he craves, the former president might need Twitter.\n\n“If he wants to intervene on behalf of a candidate he has now endorsed in the midterm elections, being able to reach that number of people with messages supporting those candidates is a way of essentially getting free advertising time to reach people who are more likely to vote as a result of getting a signal from Donald Trump,” Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, told Time.\n\nTrump may have insisted that he will snub Twitter and stick with Truth Social, but his commitment to his own platform has so far been tepid at best – Trump has posted on Truth Social just once.\n\nIf that lack of interaction hasn’t helped Truth Social, neither did the botched rollout on 21 February. Tens of thousands of people were unable to access the network – the Guardian was finally allowed in on 5 March – and by early April the Truth Social app was the 355th most popular on Apple devices.\n\nIn terms of daily active users, Truth Social had 513,000, the Daily Beast reported. Twitter has about 217 million.\n\nLack of usage – both by Trump and by the general public – is not the only problem the new network faces.\n\nShares in Digital World Acquisition Corporation, the firm which plans to merge with Trump Media & Technology Group, dropped 13% on Monday after news of Musk’s deal. Since Musk became the largest shareholder in Twitter TMTG shares have fallen by 44% overall, and two key Truth Social executives quit the platform in April.\n\nSince Trump was removed from Twitter his missives have been limited to email blasts sent from his Save America Pac, the messages frequently bleating about a “stolen election” in 2020. At the moment those emails are received by a mixture of supporters and vaguely interested journalists.\n\nIf Trump resumed tweeting, he’d have a far bigger audience for his misinformation – which could have serious consequences.\n\n“The real danger would come after election day,” Gertz said, “when he could use that same megaphone to spread lies about voter fraud as a pretext for overturning elections. If that happens, another January 6 – perhaps a more successful one – is very much in play.”', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a92109698abfe8cebc8ed79f918f6e0cb5a652cf/0_156_5131_3078/master/5131.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0c9734ab4bdc644afa8fecabe2eaf914', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:03'}

Those measures aim to make the services more appealing to advertisers seeking a safe venue, and to better accommodate politicians and regulators arguing that the platforms are responsible for all of their content. But the moves have alienated some users who, like Mr. Musk, say they go overboard.\n\nHow Twitter operates won’t be entirely up to Mr. Musk.\n\n“Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules—regardless of their shareholding,” Thierry Breton, the EU regulator, wrote Tuesday on Twitter. “Mr Musk knows this well.”\n\nMr. Breton expressed confidence that Twitter, under Mr. Musk’s ownership, would conform to the bloc’s new rules, which still need formal approval from the EU Parliament and representatives from EU countries.\n\nMr. Musk’s planned changes at Twitter, and the response, will be closely watched. Twitter is smaller and less profitable than other social-media companies. It claims 217 million so-called monetizable daily users compared with 1.9 billion daily users for Meta Platforms Inc.’s core Facebook platform and a billion-plus monthly users for TikTok. But Twitter users include media personalities, politicians, activists and tech aficionados who help shape social discourse.\n\n“It has influence way beyond its user base and way beyond its valuation, and so we care about it,” said David Kaye, former United Nations special rapporteur focused on free speech and now a law professor at the University of California, Irvine.\n\nTwitter’s existing content policies haven’t brought about huge financial success; it has struggled to deliver consistent profits. Photo: Laura Morton for The Wall Street Journal\n\nMr. Musk, chief executive of Tesla Inc. and Space Exploration Technologies Corp. as well as the world’s richest person, is one of Twitter’s most prominent users, employing the platform for everything from promoting his companies to battling rivals and critics. In Monday’s deal announcement, he said he wants to open up Twitter’s algorithms to public scrutiny, “defeat” spammers and authenticate users’ identities.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Musk said he views “free speech” as that permitted by the law—a far broader definition of what is allowable than most major social networks have adopted. “I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law,” he said in a tweet. “If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect. Therefore, going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people.”\n\nSome industry executives and analysts say Mr. Musk is in for an awakening. Reversing Twitter’s efforts risks stoking advertisers’ worries about the placement of their ads, potentially pushing them toward competitors like Snap Inc. and Meta, said Ben Black, co-head of internet research at Deutsche Bank.\n\nElon Musk struck a deal on Monday to buy Twitter for about $44 billion, moving the world’s richest man a step closer to taking control of the social-media platform. Photo: Ryan Lash/TED Conferences, LLC/AFP via Getty Images\n\n“Do you really want to have your Mercedes-Benz commercial against a beheading?” he said. “If someone falls overboard on a cruise ship, do you want your vacation message being advertised against that content?” He said less moderation could also drive away some users, potentially slowing growth.\n\n“‘Do you really want to have your Mercedes-Benz commercial against a beheading?’” — Ben Black, co-head of internet research at Deutsche Bank\n\nIn the company’s early years, Twitter executives were loath to remove content unless it broke local laws. The platform often took a hands-off approach even to content from officially designated terrorist groups, drawing criticism from researchers, lawmakers and victims’ families.\n\nIt stepped up moderation over the years, removing accounts connected to the terrorist group ISIS in 2014, for example. That accelerated during and after the 2016 U.S. presidential race, which saw a jump in complaints about white nationalists and others using the platform to attack and harass minority users.\n\nOther industry leaders who favored looser policies, including Meta co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, have gradually embraced more intervention. Platforms including Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest Inc. and Reddit Inc. all have added staff or bolstered rules to monitor their content, though each draws the lines differently.\n\nTheir efforts target a range of potentially problematic content, from hate speech and false information about elections to what they see as fringe views on health, along with other issues the platforms consider harmful. Pinterest recently banned posts that it deems to contain misinformation about climate change.\n\nTwitter and other platforms also have systems allowing users to report claims of abuse by other users, which can lead to account suspensions that some of those involved say can be arbitrary or unfair.\n\nMore moderating has required complex, and often confusing, guidelines for employees and users. Such efforts have led to some divisive decisions, including bans by Twitter and Facebook of then-President Donald Trump for posts encouraging the rioters who attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, seeking to halt certification of President Biden’s electoral victory.\n\nThose bans were widely praised on the left and by some Republicans. But Mr. Trump and his supporters blasted it and have backed rival social-media apps with fewer restrictions that so far have gained limited traction, including Parler, Gab, and Gettr, which former Trump adviser Jason Miller launched last year.\n\nMany in the Trump camp have voiced support for Mr. Musk’s planned Twitter acquisition, though Mr. Trump told Fox News on Monday that he doesn’t plan to return to the platform and would instead use his social-media startup, Truth Social.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up Technology A weekly digest of tech reviews, headlines, columns and your questions answered by WSJ's Personal Tech gurus. PREVIEW\n\nDevin Nunes, CEO of Truth Social, lauded Monday’s Twitter deal, though he said he doesn’t see the platform, even under Mr. Musk, as a direct competitor because of their different target audiences. “This is a great, great day,” the Trump ally and former GOP congressman said. “Finally we’re getting some movement in the right direction here in terms of opening the internet back up and giving people their voice back.”\n\nTwitter’s existing policies haven’t brought about huge financial success; it has struggled to deliver consistent profits. And losing advertisers might not be a problem for Mr. Musk. He has said he wants the platform to rely less on advertising—which accounts for about 90% of its revenue, totaling $5.1 billion last year—and to focus more on a subscription business model. The platform currently offers Twitter Blue, a $2.99-a-month subscription service that gives customers access to premium features.\n\nDespite Mr. Trump’s comments Monday, many observers and Twitter employees are focused on Mr. Musk’s handling of the former president’s account as a potential indicator of his plans. During an all-hands meeting on Monday, Twitter CEO Parag Agarwal was asked if the company might reinstate Mr. Trump once Mr. Musk’s ownership is completed.

He was suspended for endorsing a Babylon Bee Twitter post that joked that U.S. Assistant Secretary of Health Rachel Levine, also known as Richard Levine—a biological male who is described as transgender—is the site’s “Man of the Year” for 2022.\n\nIn a statement several weeks ago, Twitter claimed that the Babylon Bee post violated the site’s rules, claiming the joke was “hateful content,” according to the satirical website’s founder, Seth Dillon. Carlson’s account also re-posted a comment from Charlie Kirk saying Levine spent “54 years of his life as a man.”\n\nThe move comes after tech entrepreneur Elon Musk and Twitter came to an agreement for Musk to take the company private for $44 billion on Monday.\n\n“A free Twitter would mean a direct challenge to the people in charge of our country’s institutions many of whom are incompetent,” Carlson said on his top-rated Fox News program on Monday evening. “For the first time in years we’ll be able to talk honestly about our leaders. We’ll be able to have the kind of conversations that make democracy possible.”\n\nMusk’s takeover of Twitter triggered questions about whether certain users, including former President Donald Trump, would return to the platform. Trump, however, told news outlets Monday that he plans on staying with his social media site Truth Social and won’t return to Twitter.\n\n“We’re taking in millions of people, and what we’re finding is that the response on Truth is much better than being on Twitter. Twitter has bots and fake accounts, and we are doing everything we can,” Trump said. So far, Trump has only made one post on Truth Social since it was launched in February 2022.\n\nIn mid-April, Trump told Americano News that “Twitter’s become very boring” in recent months because “they’ve gotten rid of a lot of good voices on Twitter … a lot of their conservative voices.”\n\nThe deal was cemented roughly two weeks after the billionaire first revealed a 9 percent stake in the platform. Musk said last week that he had lined up $46.5 billion in financing to buy Twitter, putting pressure on the company’s board to negotiate a deal.\n\nTwitter said the transaction was unanimously approved by its board of directors and is expected to close in 2022, pending regulatory sign-off and the approval of shareholders.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2018/11/09/Tucker-Carlson-debate-1200x800.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:47'}

The constitutional protection of speech does not, on its own, engender a society in which the chance to be heard is truly abundant and free and equitably distributed.\n\n“Freedom for the wolves has often meant death to the sheep,” Mr. Berlin once said. This is a point often lost on Americans. Government — or large centralized authority — is one threat to liberty but not the only one. When it comes to speech, what has often kept a great many people from speaking isn’t censorship but the lack of a platform. Social media, including Twitter, came along and promised to change that. But when it became a cesspit of hate and harassment for women and people of color in particular, it began to offer a miserable bargain: You can be free to say what you wish, but your life can be made unrelentingly painful if you so dare.\n\nThe “censorship” that Mr. Musk performatively deplores consists of efforts to rectify these very real problems of harassment and abuse. Twitter has taken modest but wildly inadequate steps to improve safety on the platform. It has acknowledged it has a problem. It has recognized positive freedom of speech — the creation of a safe and non-life-ruining environment for the airing of thoughts. And it is this that Mr. Musk and his ilk seem to loathe.\n\nThis is why his deal to purchase Twitter is so dangerous. In recent years, there has been progress toward positive freedom of speech — real work to give everyone, truly everyone, more meaningful occasion to speak. Mr. Musk apparently wants to shut that down. Instead, in a moment of proto-fascism on the political right, his priority seems to be to undam the flood of bile and bigotry and bullying and disinformation.\n\nThe country already faces the very real prospect, starting at noon on Jan. 20, 2025, of a descent toward racist authoritarianism and a protracted slide away from liberal democracy. If your idea of what the country needs in this moment is less clamping down on hate and lies and more rightists gone wild, whew.\n\nThe plutocrats have already rigged the economy. That’s just the first step. Then you take some of the spoils and reinvest it in buying even more political influence, so that political inequality can help keep economic inequality yawning. You buy up media or social media platforms and thus can help rig the discourse in your favor, taking control of the tools used by regular people to fight back. You venture, as Mr. Musk did, to a TED conference and, without much pushback, brand yourself as a kind of public intellectual, a thought leader, a visionary, and thereby in many people’s minds you became a sage, not a robber baron.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be this way. We can have nice things. But we’re going to have to learn to see through the fraudulent stories that elevate figures like Mr. Musk into heroes. We’re going to have to legislate real guardrails — perhaps like those created by the European Union’s Digital Services Act — on social media platforms that are too big to entrust democracy to. We’re going to have to build nonprofit alternatives to the platforms and see if they can become meaningful venues.', 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/26/opinion/26giridharadas_2/26giridharadas_2-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:56'}

It can be bought or sold on crypto exchanges like Coinbase or on trading apps like Robinhood and Webull. One Dogecoin is worth 16 cents as of Tuesday morning. It's never been worth more than 64 cents. Creator Billy Markus said last year that he invented the coin as a joke.

He added: 'Do you want an edit button?'\n\nApril 5: He joins Twitter's board of directors - sees share price rocket\n\nTwitter said the tech tycoon was joining the company's board of directors, causing the social media platform's shares to rise over 7 per cent in premarket trading.\n\nIt led to speculation he would try to address what he called the platform's 'failure to adhere to free speech principles' and 'fundamentally undermine democracy'.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Musk would have served on the board until the company's 2024 annual shareholders meeting.\n\nAs long as he remains a director, the agreement said, he could not won more than 14.9 percent of the company's stock.\n\nIt meant he would not have been able to take over the company until well after his term on the board was over.\n\nThe firm said: 'Twitter is committed to impartiality in the development and enforcement of its policies and rules.\n\n'Our policy decisions are not determined by the Board or shareholders, and we have no plans to reverse any policy decisions.'\n\n'As always our Board plays an important advisory and feedback role across the entirety of our service.\n\n'Our day to day operations and decisions are made by Twitter management and employees.'\n\nApril 8: Asset managers take over Musk as largest shareholders\n\nAsset manager Vanguard Group increased its stake to overtake Musk as the largest shareholder.\n\nVanguard owned 10.3 percent of Twitter, while the Tesla tycoon owned 9.1 per cent, making him the largest individual shareholder.\n\nVanguard, led by CEO Tim Buckley, increased its stake in the company at some point during the first quarter, according to SEC filings made on April 8.\n\nIt previously reported owning 67.2million shares of Twitter or about 8.4 per cent of the company as of the end of December, according to FactSet.\n\nOther owners of large quantities of Twitter stock included Morgan Stanley, Fidelity and Black Rock.\n\nVanguard, led by CEO Tim Buckley, increased its stake in the company at some point during the first quarter, according to SEC filings made on April 8\n\nApril 9: Musk rejects the offer to join Twitter's board of directors\n\nMusk rejected an offer to join Twitter's board after disclosing his stake in the company.\n\nAnalysts said the move signaled his intention to take over the company as a board seat would have limited his stake to just under 15 per cent.\n\nParag Agrawal said the board would still 'remain open' to Musk's input, but warned: 'There will be distractions ahead but our goals and priorities remain unchanged.'\n\nHe said: 'The board and I had many discussions about Elon joining the board, and with Elon directly. We were excited to collaborate and clear about the risks.\n\n'We also believed that having Elon as a fiduciary of the company where he, like all board members, has to act in the best interests of the company and all our shareholders, was the best path forward. The board offered him a seat.'\n\nAgrawal continued: 'We announced on Tuesday that Elon would be appointed to the board contingent on a background check and formal acceptance.\n\n'Elon's appointment to the board was to become officially effective 4/9, but Elon shared that same morning that he will no longer be joining the board.'\n\nParag Agrawal said the board would still 'remain open' to Musk's input, but warned: 'There will be distractions ahead but our goals and priorities remain unchanged'\n\nApril 12: Twitter shareholder Marc Bain Rasella files suit against Musk\n\nMarc Bain Rasella filed a lawsuit against Musk for alleged securities fraud at a Manhattan federal court, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nThe suit claimed the billionaire was required to disclose his holdings to the SEC by March 24, but the delay kept Twitter's share price down allowing Musk to buy more.\n\nMusk was accused of violating a regulatory deadline to reveal he had accumulated a stake of at least five per cent.\n\nInstead, according to the complaint, Musk did not disclose his position in Twitter until he had almost doubled his stake to more than nine per cent.\n\nThat strategy, the lawsuit alleges, hurt less wealthy investors who sold shares in the company in the nearly two weeks before Musk acknowledged holding a major stake.\n\nApril 14: The Tesla tycoon offers to buy Twitter for $43 BILLION\n\nMusk offered to buy Twitter for $43billion, a regulatory filing showed, as he moved to seize the social media giant.\n\nMusk's offer price of $54.20 per share represented a 38 per cent premium to the closing price of Twitter's stock on April 1.\n\nThis was the last trading day before the Tesla CEO's over nine per cent investment in the company was publicly announced.\n\nIt even appeared to reference marijuana - also known as 420 - a common reference used by Musk on Twitter.\n\nTwitter said in a regulatory filing Musk provided a letter containing a proposal to buy the remaining shares of Twitter he did not already own.\n\nApril 15: Twitter launches 'poison pill' strategy to stop Musk buyout\n\nTwitter's board announced a dramatic poison pill plan to prevent Musk from increasing his stake in the company.\n\nAlso known as a shareholder rights provision, the plan would trigger a dilution of shares if any shareholder builds up a 15 per cent stake without the board's approval.\n\nThe plan did not prevent Twitter from accepting Musk's offer or entering negotiations with him or other potential buyers.\n\nBut it did stop the billionaire from putting pressure on the board by buying up ever more shares on the open market.\n\nMusk hit back with a laughing emoji to a version of the classic 'Distracted Boyfriend' meme mocking Twitter's board.\n\nThe imaged depicted 'Twitter's board' looking wistfully at the option to 'keep that easy gig that gives me shares' as 'Twitter investors' look on with disgust.\n\nTwitter's board is led by chairman Bret Taylor, who is also the co-CEO of business software giant Salesforce\n\nApril 16: Musk tweets Love Me Tender in tease of hostile takeover\n\nMusk tweeted 'Love Me Tender' as he again teased at the possibility of a hostile takeover of Twitter.\n\nThe billionaire posted the Elvis Presley lyrics in a potential bid to lure shareholders with a tender offer that could see him seize control.\n\nA tender offer would see him bypass the board and go to shareholders with his offer of $54.20 a share - but he would need to show how he would finance his bid.\n\nHe also appeared to suggest he would strip board members of their salaries, saying they would get '$0 if my bid succeeds'.\n\nApril 18: Jack Dorsey slams the Twitter board for 'plots and coups'\n\nJack Dorsey slammed the board of Twitter as he weighed into the toxic fight over Elon Musk's attempted hostile takeover for the first time.\n\nThe former CEO, who is still a member of the board himself, blasted the 'plots and coups' that were 'consistently the dysfunction of the company'.\n\nIn a series of bombshell tweets and replies, he endorsed one posting saying that 'a bad board will kill a company every time'.\n\nReplying to one post, he said: 'When I was fired in 2008 and made chair, the board took most of my shares away from me.\n\n'I also gave 1 per cent of the company back to the employee pool in 2015.

TWTR -3.91% will need to follow the bloc’s new rules for tackling illegal and harmful content online if it wants to keep operating there, marking a possible challenge to Elon Musk’s plans to take a more hands-off approach to content moderation.\n\nThierry Breton, EU internal market commissioner, said Tuesday in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that it’s his job to make sure companies, including Twitter, understand their obligations in Europe. That will soon include a series of new obligations for social media and other online platforms, called the Digital Services Act, after lawmakers agreed to the main points of the legislation last week.\n\n“Now we have very clear rules,” Mr. Breton said. “They can do whatever they want outside of Europe…but in Europe they will just have to fulfill [our] rules and obligations.”\n\nThe Digital Services Act aims to force platforms to take more responsibility for the content their users post online. It will introduce a series of obligations for large social-media networks like Twitter, ranging from new standards for taking down illegal content to a requirement to conduct annual risk assessments detailing how they are responding to harmful content that is posted online.\n\nTwitter will become a private company if Elon Musk’s $44 billion takeover bid is approved. The move would allow Musk to make changes to the site. WSJ’s Dan Gallagher explains Musk’s proposed changes and the challenges he might face enacting them. Illustration: Jordan Kranse\n\nThe text of the new law still needs formal approval from the EU Parliament and representatives from EU countries, but it is unlikely to change substantially from what lawmakers agreed to last week.\n\nMr. Breton expressed confidence in a post on Twitter earlier Tuesday that the company under Mr. Musk’s ownership would conform to the EU’s new rules.\n\n“Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules—regardless of their shareholding,” Mr. Breton wrote. “Mr Musk knows this well. He is familiar with European rules on automotive, and will quickly adapt to the Digital Services Act.”\n\nMr. Musk’s purchase of Twitter could mark an eventual test case for the EU’s new legislation once it comes into effect, said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond. While there are questions about whether the European Commission will have the resources to fully enforce the new law, Prof. Tobias said, “I do think [Mr. Musk] is on notice, and Twitter shareholders, too.”\n\nMr. Musk wrote on Twitter Tuesday afternoon that his view of free speech is speech that “matches the law.”\n\n“I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law,” he said. “If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect.”\n\nMr. Breton said the EU was careful in setting its regulations to maintain freedom of speech. He said he had interactions with many platforms during the lawmaking process and was open to meeting with others, in a comment that appeared to be aimed at Mr. Musk. “If any new shareholder of these platforms is willing to engage with me, my door will be totally open, like always,” he said.\n\nThe EU’s new legislation won’t prevent Mr. Musk from taking a more free-speech-oriented approach, said Zach Meyers, a senior research fellow with the Centre for European Reform think tank.

In the wake of this "great deplatforming," Republicans\' longstanding gripes with these platforms became a legislative priority.\n\nOne of the most aggressive of these Republican-led efforts to regulate social media is Texas\' H.B. 20. Ostensibly passed to combat the "dangerous movement by social media companies to silence conservative viewpoints and ideas," this bill prohibits social media platforms from removing users or content "based on the viewpoint" of the user or content. In its effort to protect conservative speech, Texas Republicans have adopted a historically discredited left-wing legal theory, dispensing with core conservative values in the process.\n\nIn the 1960s, a group of progressive scholars argued that the First Amendment does not merely prohibit the government from censoring private speech and press. In fact, they argued, it granted the government the affirmative power to control the mass media. In a capitalist system, they reasoned, the government must ensure that private media owners do not exclude unwelcome viewpoints, in order to protect the "democratic interest" in free speech. To this end, the scholars championed the Fairness Doctrine, right-of-reply mandates, and expansive applications of "common carriage" doctrine, which enable the government to force the inclusion of certain content.\n\nBorrowing from the same playbook, Texas now argues that First Amendment values require, rather than prohibit, government interference with private speech. H.B. 20 declares that social media platforms are common carriers like telephone companies and thus are subject to onerous restrictions over who and what they may host. According to Texas, H.B. 20 serves the democratic interest in protecting the free exchange of ideas and information. But like the collectivist efforts that preceded it, Texas\' misguided attempt to advance "First Amendment rights in the Lone Star State" violates private platforms\' First Amendment rights to choose what speech they publish.\n\nAs we explained in a recently filed amicus curiae brief on behalf of the Cato Institute, courts have repeatedly rejected such regulations, and for good reasons.\n\nFirst, as a federal district court correctly noted last year, the First Amendment protects social media platforms\' discretion to publish or remove content. The Supreme Court established this right in the 1974 case Miami Herald Publishing Company v. Tornillo, when it struck down a Florida law that forced newspapers to print responses to their criticism of political candidates. The Court explained that this "right-of-reply" law infringed on newspapers\' right to choose what content they publish.\n\nThe Supreme Court affirmed that First Amendment rights apply with full force to internet media in 1997\'s Reno v. ACLU. Other federal courts have since upheld the editorial rights of search engines and social media sites. These precedents doom the Texas law. The state can\'t eviscerate platforms\' well-established First Amendment rights by arbitrarily calling them common carriers.\n\nSecond, efforts like H.B. 20 chill, rather than encourage, the exercise of free speech. Both the Florida right-of-reply law and the Fairness Doctrine actually discouraged the media from covering controversial topics that would trigger the forced-hosting requirements. Likewise, H.B. 20 will encourage platforms to ban entire subjects (say, discussions of terrorism) to avoid facing the unappetizing choice to either host objectionable viewpoints (such as pro-terrorism material) or face liability for removing each piece of content.\n\nThird, H.B. 20 violates fundamental property rights by forcing private platforms to host users and content they would otherwise exclude. The First Amendment does not authorize the government to co-opt private property to amplify certain viewpoints.\n\nThe supporters of the Texas law, like other conservative opponents of Big Tech, cite anecdotal accounts of inconsistent content moderation to support their claim of unfair bias. But it\'s more likely that these incidents are just casualties of the margin of error inherent in content moderation at scale. "Incorrect" removals of content happen millions of times per day to users representing every conceivable ideology. Conservatives are removed from platforms when they violate platforms\' terms of service, but Texas\' premise that conservatives are being unfairly targeted is unsubstantiated.\n\nBut even if it was substantiated, forced-hosting laws like H.B. 20 would contravene limited government, constitutional fidelity, and strong property rights, all of which are supposed to be core conservative values. If Texas Republicans really want to protect "conservative viewpoints," they should reacquaint themselves with those principles and reject giving the government more control over social media.', 'image': 'https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2022/04/timothy-hales-bennett-OwvRB-M3GwE-unsplash-scaled.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:31'}

It is a reminder why we need a wealth tax and why we need some serious regulation for Big Tech. One billionaire should not be able to turn the world upside down just because he plays by a different set of rules,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who believes the government should break up Big Tech companies to promote more competition.\n\nAsked whether Musk’s acquisition of Twitter was cause for concern, Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said: “Absolutely it does.”\n\n“He said he wants to make it this global message board. My first question to him, ‘Is your message board going to include Donald Trump?’ ” he said. “That’s a key question. If he lets that man rant and rave on Twitter, not in the best interests of America’s’ future.”\n\nDurbin, who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee, noted that his and other panels are exploring whether it would be appropriate to impose new regulations on Big Tech companies to incentivize them to do more to moderate content.\n\nSpeaking at Stanford last week, Obama said tech firms “need to be more transparent about how they operate” and crack down on “lies and conspiracy theories” that threaten the nation’s democratic system.\n\n“Without some standards, implications of this technology — for our elections, for our legal system, for our democracy, for rules of evidence, for our entire social order — are frightening and profound,” he warned.\n\nMusk hasn’t said whether he’ll let Trump, who was permanently barred from Twitter in January 2021, back on the platform, but his recent comments have fueled speculation that he might do so. Trump has indicated he’s not interested in getting back on Twitter, though he is known for changing his mind.\n\nSen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he also had concerns about what Musk’s purchase of Twitter might mean for the platform’s content standards.\n\nHe said he was looking into the matter but declined to provide any detail.\n\n“I’ve got some concerns. I think it will have to go through … some level of appropriate regulatory [review], and I’m doing some of my own checking,” he said.\n\nSen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) said Musk’s control over a major forum for political debate is alarming.\n\n“It’s always a concern when an oligarch may be owning the town square. I think we do need to pay a lot of attention to how it’s managed,” he said.\n\nMusk’s takeover of Twitter raises questions about what it means for his settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over fraud charges stemming from his August 2018 tweet that he had secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 per share, which pushed the car company’s stock higher.\n\nUnder the settlement, Musk must allow a Tesla lawyer to review any tweets containing material business information before hitting the send button.\n\nSen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), the chairwoman of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, said allowing Trump back on Twitter would be a major problem.\n\n“I think that’s very problematic,” she said of Trump’s possible return. “I don’t think that somebody who encouraged and organized a violent insurrection to take over our government should be allowed on Twitter.”\n\nAsked about the loosening of content standards, she said she “would certainly have concerns” but added she hadn’t looked at the deal closely enough to “get into a big analysis.”\n\nTrump, who has launched a social media venture that includes a platform intended to vie with Twitter, told Fox News on Monday that he doesn’t plan to return to Twitter.\n\n“I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,” he said, referring to his Truth Social messaging platform, before the deal was announced. “I hope Elon buys Twitter because he’ll make improvements to it and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth. The bottom line is, no, I am not going back to Twitter.”\n\nTwitter permanently suspended Trump because of what it called “the risk of further incitement of violence” after a mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to halt the certification of President Biden’s victory.\n\nTwitter later unveiled a civic integrity policy that prohibited the use of its services for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes. It also reserved the right to flag or reduce the visibility of tweets containing false or misleading information about civic processes.\n\nAt a TED conference this month, Musk stressed the importance of allowing free speech on Twitter.\n\n“Twitter has become kind of the de facto town square, so it’s just really important that people have both the reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely within the bounds of the law,” he said.\n\nConservatives on Monday applauded Musk’s move.\n\n“Elon Musk did his part for free speech today. Let’s hope the Supreme Court does as well,” former Rep. Mark Walker (N.C.), a conservative Republican running for Senate, tweeted Monday afternoon.\n\nDemocrats are worried what that means for policing claims that Biden stole the 2020 presidential election or misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n“I’m a big free speech guy, but this stuff isn’t working. It’s terrorizing democracy, and from that perspective I think it’s bad for Democrats in this sense: These Republican alt groups tend to dominate. They tend to have much more of a footprint on these social media platforms than Democrats do,” said Steve Jarding, a Democratic strategist and former senior adviser to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\nJarding is also the communications director for a new social media platform called Pixstory, which has a business model designed to root out hate and misinformation by giving integrity scores to people who post on the site.\n\nBut Jarding called it “a horrible problem” that the world’s richest person is taking over a major means of political discourse at a time when Democrats are discussing proposals to tax the unrealized capital gains of multibillionaires such as Musk to pay for proposals to fight climate change and economic inequality.\n\n“He could turn it into anything that he wants. He controls literally hundreds of millions of hits, if you will, or clicks on a platform that he can determine whether it’s used in a good way or a bad way, and that’s too much concentration with one individual,” Jarding added.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/stabenowdebbie_020922arl.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:10'}

As YouTube celebrates its 17th birthday, the game-changing user-generated video platform once known for funny pet videos and other benign content continues to attract criticism for its alleged role in fostering extremism. Ample evidence casts doubt on the idea that social media platforms are radicalizing American youth, but high-profile anecdotes about bad turns allegedly inspired by YouTube, Facebook, and other sites make it hard to combat such claims. Now one such story may come before the Supreme Court—and threaten a foundational internet speech law.\n\nThe case (Gonzalez v. Google LLC) involves a man whose daughter was killed in a 2015 ISIS attack in Paris. The grieving father, Reynaldo Gonzalez, sued YouTube\'s parent company, Google, under the U.S. Anti-Terrorism Act. Gonzalez claims that ISIS posted recruitment videos on YouTube, that YouTube recommended these videos to users, and that this led to his daughter\'s death.\n\nGonzalez\'s circumstances are tragic, but his claim is convoluted and patently illogical. To buy it, you have to buy the idea that without YouTube, the terrorist group not only would be unable to recruit members but would cease to use existing networks to carry out attacks.\n\nThe Supreme Court has not yet decided whether it will hear Gonzalez\'s case. But if it does, it could give the Court a chance to consider the parameters of Section 230, the federal law preventing internet companies and users from being liable for all third-party speech (and pretty much the backbone of the internet as we know it).\n\nSCOTUSblog notes that in 2020, Justice Clarence Thomas suggested that "in an appropriate case, we should consider whether the text of this increasingly important statute aligns with the current state of immunity enjoyed by Internet platforms." (Thomas made a similar suggestion earlier this year.)\n\n"The petition in Gonzalez v. Google LLC tries to present itself as the case Thomas has been looking for," writes Andrew Hamm:\n\nThe district court dismissed Gonzalez\'s claim on the ground that Section 230 nonetheless protected Google for its recommendations because ISIS produced the videos, not Google. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit affirmed, concluding that Section 230 protects such recommendations, at least if the provider\'s algorithm treated content on its website similarly. However, the panel in Gonzalez considered itself bound to reach this result because of a recent case on the same issue that another 9th Circuit panel decided while Gonzalez was pending. The Gonzalez panel further concluded that, if it could resolve the question itself, Section 230 would not protect a provider\'s content recommendations. Gonzalez admits that the circuits to face this question are not split. Instead, Gonzalez suggests that, had his case simply come out before the other 9th Circuit decision, then Google would be the one seeking review. Regardless, he maintains, the providers\' financial dependence on advertisements and hence on algorithms that can target users makes this question of recommendations important to resolve.\n\nGonzalez is far from the first person to sue social media companies over terrorist acts. But these people "have yet to talk a court into agreeing with their arguments," as Tim Cushing noted at Techdirt last fall.\n\n"The facts in these cases are invariably awful: often people have been brutally killed and their loved ones are seeking redress for their loss. There is a natural, and perfectly reasonable, temptation to give them some sort of remedy from someone, but as we argued in our brief, that someone cannot be an internet platform," wrote constitutional lawyer Cathy Gellis in 2017:\n\nThere are several reasons for this, including some that have nothing to do with Section 230. For instance, even if Section 230 did not exist and platforms could be liable for the harms resulting from their users\' use of their services, for them to be liable there would have to be a clear connection between the use of the platform and the harm.\n\nSection 230 "should prevent a court from ever even reaching the tort law analysis," added Gellis. "With Section 230, a platform should never find itself having to defend against liability for harm that may have resulted from how people used it."\n\nA new study backs up what advocates for Section 230 have been saying for a long time: The law protects small companies and creators more than big tech giants.\n\n"If you understand the mechanisms by which Section 230 actually works, the key is that it gets frivolous and wasteful lawsuits kicked out of court much earlier—when the costs are still intense, but more bearable," points out Mike Masnick in a Techdirt post about the study. "Without Section 230, the end result of the court case may be the same—where the company wins—but the costs would be much, much higher. For Facebook and Google that\'s not going to make a huge difference. But for smaller companies, it can be the difference between life and death."\n\n"Larger enterprises are less impacted by lawsuits," point out the authors of the study, in a report titled "Understanding Section 230 & the Impact of Litigation on Small Providers." A large company "may already have: 1) lawyers ready to deal with lawsuits (allowing the business to continue with minimal disruption); 2) insurance coverage that can offset the cost of a defense, a settlement, or a damage award; and 3) sufficient revenue and cash reserves such that most cases are viewed as a cost of doing business rather than a cataclysmic event."\n\nSmall companies are less likely to have or be able to afford any of these things, making it less likely that they will fight even lawsuits that they would win.\n\nPoliticians, alas, have taken to scapegoating Section 230 for basically anything they or their constituents don\'t like about the internet. And lawyers keep getting creative in their anti–Section 230 arguments, suggesting that while Section 230 may broadly protect internet platforms from liability for many things that users post, the law does not covers various facets of these platforms—their design, their algorithms, etc..\n\nOccasionally, judges appear sympathetic to this. In Taamneh v. Twitter, which the 9th Circuit ruled on last year, Judge Marsha Berzon wrote that Section 230 protects "only traditional activities of publication and distribution—such as deciding whether to publish, withdraw, or alter content—and does not include activities that promote or recommend content or connect content users to each other. I urge this Court to reconsider our precedent en banc to the extent that it holds that section 230 extends to the use of machine-learning algorithms to recommend content and connections to users."\n\n"This is a really weird, really dangerous place to start drawing the line in Section 230 lawsuits," wrote Tim Cushing last summer. "Algorithms react to input from users. If YouTube can\'t be held directly responsible for videos uploaded by users, it makes sense it would be immunized against algorithmically suggesting content based on users\' actions and preferences. The algorithm does next to nothing on its own without input from content viewers. It takes a user to really get it moving."\n\nFREE MINDS\n\nA federal appeals court has rejected a university\'s ban on "discriminatory harassment." The University of Central Florida\'s "discriminatory harassment" ban likely violates the First Amendment, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals said. The case is Speech First, Inc. v. Cartwright, and you can read the whole ruling here. In essence, the court found the school\'s policy against allegedly discriminatory speech to be too broad:\n\n[T]he policy (1) prohibits a wide range of "verbal, physical, electronic, and other" expression concerning any of (depending on how you count) some 25 or so characteristics; (2) states that prohibited speech "may take many forms, including verbal acts, name-calling, graphic or written statements" and even "other conduct that may be humiliating"; (3) employs a gestaltish "totality of known circumstances" approach to determine whether particular speech, for instance, "unreasonably alters" another student\'s educational experience; and (4) reaches not only a student\'s own speech, but also her conduct "encouraging," "condoning," or "failing to intervene" to stop another student\'s speech. The policy, in short, is staggeringly broad, and any number of statements—some of which are undoubtedly protected by the First Amendment—could qualify for prohibition under its sweeping standards. To take a few obvious examples, the policy targets "verbal, physical, electronic or other conduct" based on "race," "ethnicity," "religion [or] non-religion," "sex," and "political affiliation." Among the views that Speech First\'s members have said they want to advocate are that "abortion is immoral," that the government "should not be able to force religious organizations to recognize marriages with which they disagree," that "affirmative action is deeply unfair," that "a man cannot become a woman because he \'feels\' like one," that "illegal immigration is dangerous," and that "the Palestinian movement is anti-Semitic."\n\nIn a concurring opinion, Judge Stanley Marcus warned against "the grave peril posed by a policy that effectively polices adherence to intellectual dogma."\n\n"History provides us with ample warning of those times and places when colleges and universities have stopped pursuing truth and have instead turned themselves into cathedrals for the worship of certain dogma," wrote Marcus. "By depriving itself of academic institutions that pursue truth over any other concern, a society risks falling into the abyss of ignorance. Humans are not smart enough to have ideas that lie beyond challenge and debate."\n\nThe Volokh Conspiracy has more on the ruling (which includes the lovely line "the state is a really big boy") here.\n\nFREE MARKETS\n\nPrivate space mission on its way back to earth.

The four crew members—Michael López-Alegría, a former NASA astronaut-turned-Axiom employee who is commanding the mission; Israeli businessman Eytan Stibbe; Canadian investor Mark Pathy; and Ohio-based real estate magnate Larry Connor—left the space station aboard their SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule on Sunday at 9:10 pm EST….They will spend about one day free flying through orbit before plummeting back into the atmosphere and parachuting to a splashdown landing off the coast of Florida around 1 pm ET Monday. AX-1, which launched on April 8, was originally billed as a 10-day mission, but delays extended the mission by about a week.\n\nThis isn\'t the first time private citizens have been able to pay for seats on spacecraft. "But AX-1 is the first mission with a crew entirely comprised of private citizens with no active members of a government astronaut corps accompanying them in the capsule during the trip to and from the ISS," reports CNN. "It\'s also the first time private citizens have traveled to the ISS on a US-made spacecraft."\n\nAnd it\'s also a powerful reminder that perhaps the next era of space exploration needn\'t be government funded and managed.\n\nQUICK HITS\n\n• Air Force Major General William T.

This afternoon, the board accepted Musk\'s offer to buy the company for $54.20 a share.\n\nLong a Twitter power user/troll/loudmouth, Musk bought a 9.2 percent stake in the company last month, becoming the largest shareholder, before deciding he\'d rather have the whole thing.\n\nCue hysteria! Musk haters have taken to the site to declare that Donald Trump will now probably win the 2024 election, that Musk\'s bid is really about white power, that Section 230 must be reformed, and that, yes, Musk\'s new policies will be lethal. (Perhaps the death toll will be even larger than net neutrality\'s!)\n\nSo, for users of the platform, what\'s likely to change?\n\nMusk has panned the site\'s existing content moderation policies, saying they are too restrictive and encroach on people\'s ability to speak freely without being censored. Some liberalization of these policies and the re-platforming of controversial figures like former President Donald Trump—who was banned in the wake of the January 6 riot for inciting violence among his fans—seems likely, though unpopular with droves of users.\n\nAt the mid-April TED conference in Vancouver, Musk talked about his interest in making Twitter\'s algorithm open-source. The Diff\'s Byrne Hobart took this a step further, outlining how "Twitter should monetize a protocol rather than run an app," and explaining the tension between Twitter as a consumer product and as "a way for individual users to update a universal shared database, which can then be filtered based on who\'s interested in what." Hobart claims that it\'s possible that Twitter has been "radically miss-monetized," and that Musk could potentially realign its priorities. However, little of the online discourse has focused on the technical possibilities.\n\nThe new Twitter owner has, through coy tweets, hinted that his new policies will not be applied arbitrarily and that consistent application will mean some number of right-wing users currently cheering his new ownership will surely be disappointed:\n\nI hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 25, 2022\n\nA social media platform\'s policies are good if the most extreme 10% on left and right are equally unhappy — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 19, 2022\n\nElsewhere, Musk has said that Twitter is a "town square" or "public square," and that banning people from using the platform effectively prevents them from participating in the important discussions of the day.\n\nThough people who care about fostering a culture of free speech may agree with the tenor of Musk\'s comments, the analogy is a terrible one. For most of America, the public square is the school board meeting and the town council meeting. There are also numerous other privates spaces for civic engagement: the church pulpit and the post-sermon fray it inspires; neighborhood listservs and the cesspool that is NextDoor; or maybe it\'s Facebook, in-person conversations, and email lists. For many millions of Americans, Twitter is not integral to hashing out values, concerns, and disagreements. Think of the implications if we expected the government to treat such companies—which have their own terms of service and standards that they are free to decide and we are free to consent to—as something akin to public utilities.\n\nIf anything, the new owner of a social media company should convey an inflated sense of the platform\'s worth! But Musk has at times, despite his forceful defense of free speech culture on the internet, repeated confused talking points that indicate scattered thinking while simultaneously failing to fully flesh out what day-to-day operations will look like. For example, a lot of content moderation involves the unsexy—and not very ideological—challenge of keeping spam under control. And, as Mike Masnick points out at Techdirt, Musk doesn\'t seem to have a particularly robust understanding of "hate speech" and how much of what we call hate speech is, in fact, protected by the First Amendment.\n\nA lot remains to be seen about how Twitter will change and what Musk will bring to the table. Optimism, with some reservations about Musk\'s ability to execute, seems warranted. Hysteria—like declaring that it\'s now open season for white supremacists, that Musk\'s vision for free speech will be "lethal," or that Musk is an echo of imperialist, colonizer forebears because he wants to go to Mars—is not.', 'image': 'https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2022/04/thumbnail-9-3.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:46'}

I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law.\n\n“If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect. Therefore, going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people.”\n\nBreton spoke as human rights groups reacted to the Twitter board accepting Musk’s bid with warnings of damaging consequences if the billionaire’s commitment to free speech results in a loosening of restrictions on harmful content.\n\nAmnesty International said it was concerned about any decision that Twitter may take after Musk’s takeover to erode enforcement of the policies and mechanisms designed to moderate hate speech online.\n\n“The last thing we need is a Twitter that wilfully turns a blind eye to violent and abusive speech against users, particularly those most disproportionately impacted, including women, non-binary persons, and others,” Michael Kleinman, director of technology and human rights at Amnesty International USA,\n\nDeborah Brown, a digital rights researcher and advocate at Human Rights Watch, said even small changes to the platform could have a devastating impact.\n\nThe UK is also introducing a tougher regulatory regime for digital platforms with the online safety bill, which requires businesses such as Twitter and Facebook to protect users from harmful content and carries the threat of fines of up to 10% of global turnover for breaches.\n\nImran Ahmed, chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a campaign group, said: “The UK and the EU are going to have tools to deal with this.

Musk paid $44 billion to acquire the social media platform with the stated aim of turning it into a haven for "free speech."\n\nThe web is awash in speculation over what that means. Conservatives and people booted off the platform have pushed for Musk to reinstate banned accounts, including that of former President Donald Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, prominent Twitter figures are now saying they\'ll leave the platform in protest of its new owner. Among them is English actress Jameela Jamil, who tweeted her fears Monday that Musk "is going to help this hell platform reach its final form of totally lawless hate, bigotry, and misogyny."\n\nIt\'s unclear whether Musk will be able to realize all his plans for Twitter. The tech leader has floated less moderation, less advertising and an open-source algorithm. But Musk\'s stated ideals contradict his own actions.\n\nWhat Musk says he wants\n\nMusk has made clear he wants less moderation — which he considers censorship — on the platform.\n\n"Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated," he said in Monday\'s announcement about the acquisition.\n\nHe also said he wants to defeat the "spambots," or automated accounts that mimic real users; open the algorithm to public inspection and "authenticate all humans" using the platform.\n\nMusk laid out a definition of speech in a TED interview last week.\n\n"A good sign as to whether there is free speech is, is someone you don\'t like allowed to say something you don\'t like? If that is the case, we have free speech," he said.\n\nMusk said Twitter would abide by national laws that restrict speech around the world. Beyond that, he said, he\'d be "very reluctant" to delete posts or permanently ban users who violate the company\'s rules.\n\nHe had previously criticized Trump\'s ban from social media in the wake of the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Twitter and Facebook permanently banned Trump\'s account on the grounds that he incited violence.\n\n"A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech," Musk tweeted days after Trump was banned from both Facebook and Twitter.\n\nHow Musk responds to disagreement\n\nMusk\'s own history, however, puts in doubt his commitment to let people he doesn\'t like speak. As the newsletter Popular Information has documented, Musk has regularly blocked users who criticize him or Tesla; threatened pro-union Tesla employees and company whistleblowers; and has aggressively gone after short-sellers and journalists who are critical of Tesla, sometimes calling their work "false" or "misleading."\n\nIn 2018, he launched a vendetta against Linette Lopez, an Insider journalist critical of Tesla, a move which writer Felix Salmon called "obsessive and deranged."\n\nMusk\'s popular tweets typically send a swarm of his social media fans directly to the accounts of reporters to harass them for hours or days.\n\nSome academics say that Musk\'s hands-off approach threatens to bring Twitter to its bad old days, when harassment and abuse were rampant.\n\n"With Musk, his posturing of free speech — just leave everything up — that would be bad in and of itself," said Paul Barrett, the deputy director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University. "If you stop moderating — with automated systems and human reviews — a site like Twitter, in the space of a short period of time, you would have a cesspool."\n\nSome former Twitter employees are also dismayed by Musk\'s successful bid for the company.\n\n"Twitter is going to let a man-child essentially take over their platform," said Leslie Miley, a former Twitter employee who has also worked for Google and Apple. Miley, who was the only Black engineer at Twitter in a leadership position when he left the company in 2015, echoed doubts shared by others about Musk\'s grasp of the platform\'s complexities.\n\n"I am not sure if Elon knows what he is getting," Miley said. "He may just find that having Twitter is a lot different than wanting Twitter."\n\nUnfettered expression does not attract advertisers\n\nA decade ago, a Twitter executive called the company "the free speech wing of the free speech party," underscoring its commitment to untrammeled freedom of expression. But the company reversed itself after reports of online abuse and harassment became frequent.\n\nIn the U.S., a visceral 2014 article by journalist Amanda Hess exposed the incessant, vile harassment many women faced just for posting on Twitter or other online forums. Twitter also learned about the consequences of an unmoderated social platform: mainly, that it undercut their funding from advertisers.\n\nAds are how Twitter makes money, and companies generally don\'t want their ads running against violent threats, hate speech that bleeds into incitement or incendiary information aimed at tipping elections or undermining public health.\n\nGoogle, Barrett pointed out, quickly learned this lesson the hard way when major companies like Toyota and Anheuser-Busch yanked their ads after they ran ahead of YouTube videos produced by extremists in 2015.\n\nOnce it was clear just how unhealthy the conversation had gotten, Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey spent years trying to improve what he called the "health" of the conversation on the platform.\n\nThe company was an early adopter of the "report abuse" button after U.K. member of parliament Stella Creasy received a barrage of rape and death threats on the platform. The online abuse was the result of a seemingly positive tweet in support of feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez, who successfully advocated for novelist Jane Austen to appear on a British banknote. Creasy\'s online harasser was sent to prison for 18 weeks.\n\nTwitter has continued to craft rules and invest in staff and technology that detected violent threats, harassment and misinformation that violated its policies. After evidence emerged that Russia used Twitter\'s platforms to try to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election, social media companies stepped up their efforts against political misinformation. All have struggled with defining "misinformation," however, and been accused of both leaving up false content as well as over-censoring legitimate posts.\n\nHard to unwind moderation\n\nThe big question now is how far Musk wants to ratchet back these systems — and whether users and advertisers will stick around if he does.\n\nLike Miley, the former Twitter engineer, experts who have studied content moderation and researched Twitter express doubt that Musk knows what he is getting into. After all, there are plenty of fledgling examples of so-called free speech-focused platforms that have been launched in the past few years as Twitter alternatives, largely by conservatives unhappy with the Twitter\'s crackdown on hate, harassment and misinformation. Many such sites have struggled to deal with toxic content, and at least one has been cut off by its own technology providers in protest.\n\n"This move just shows how effective (moderation features) have been to annoy those in power," said Kirsten Martin, a professor of technology ethics at the University of Notre Dame. "I would be worried as to how this would change Twitter\'s values."\n\nThe fact that no other bidders emerged in public before Musk\'s deal was a sign that other would-be acquirers might find Twitter too difficult to improve, said Third Bridge analyst Scott Kessler.\n\n"This platform is pretty much the same one we\'ve had over the last decade or so," Kessler said. "You\'ve had a lot of smart people trying to figure out what they should do, and they\'ve had trouble. It\'s probably going to be tough to make a lot of headway."\n\nEven now, Americans say they\'re more likely to be harassed on social media than any other online forum, with women, people of color and LGBTQ users reporting a disproportionate amount of that abuse. Roughly 80% of users believe the companies are still doing only a "fair or poor" job of handling that harassment, according to a Pew Research Center survey of U.S. adults last year.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/04/30/39aaad79-fd57-40fa-b203-bc4143cf40f2/thumbnail/1200x630g8/aef00fb0dcf931880dd52af0a50dc345/gettyimages-1206290121.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:24'}

In Canada, vaccine-free Canadians still cannot board a train or a plane and travel from one region of the country to another.\n\nIn Canada, air and train travel are regulated by the federal government, even when you travel within the same province. The feds have made it so only a vaccine passport, or very limited jab exemptions, will afford you the opportunity to visit family, friends, or travel for work.\n\nThis means that if you lived in, let’s say, Kitchener, Ontario, you could not get on a VIA Rail train and travel to Toronto… even though you could travel from Kitchener to Toronto on a commuter train that is not under federal jurisdiction.\n\nIsn’t “science” wonderful!\n\nOh, and vaccine-free Canadians also can’t LEAVE the country. Unjabbed Canadians are told they can’t “put others at risk” by boarding a plane with vaccinated people (because vaccines suddenly…work?). Apparently, it is good for the unvaccinated to stay in Canada, even though … they are risk to everyone else who is protected by a vaccine?\n\nTrudeau’s insecurity on display\n\nNow, on the one hand it is quite easy to understand why Trudeau is acting like an evil dictator: he has proven himself to be an immoral tyrant on many occasions. However, given the fact that other leftist tyrants have eased up, it is clearly not just leftism or progressivism that causing him to trap Canadians indefinitely in their home like real-life versions of The Truman Show. (How fitting that it was Canadian Jim Carrey who starred in that film.)\n\nThere is something unique about Trudeau that is causing him to become “regressive” as the rest of the leftist dominated West is affording vaccine-free citizens their civil rights.\n\nTo the outside world, Trudeau may look like a confident – if not cringeworthy – tin-pot dictator, but in reality, he is a 50-year-old boy with little to no virtue. He is essentially a spoiled teenager who can remember lines and present himself well in a tailored suit and has a family name that tricked people into thinking he was competent.\n\nHis (Canadian) father, Pierre Trudeau, for all his faults, was shrewd and intelligent – even if evil. Justin Trudeau is evil and unintelligent and quite obtuse.\n\nI can’t help but think he believes he must prove himself as being his own verified dictator in order to fill his daddy’s shoes.

Sign this Petition Please SIGN and SHARE this petition to the new owner of Twitter, Elon Musk, asking him to reinstate LifeSiteNews\' truth-telling Twitter accounts which have been suspended since early 2021. After contentious negotiations, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has purchased Twitter, thereby transforming the tech giant into a private company. A self-styled "free speech absolutist," Mr. Musk\'s entrepreneurial spirit may define his approach to governing Twitter, where, in the marketplace of ideas, the best ideas - not those aided by censorship - will naturally prevail among the competition. Of course, there are limits to free speech. But, for too long, Big Tech giants (including, Twitter, Google, YouTube and Facebook) have subjected their conservative and Christian users to all forms of censorship, desperately trying to silence our voices. So if, as it seems, Mr. Musk will level the playing field for conservatives and Christians and allow a true exchange of ideas to occur on his platform, then we look forward to our chance to re-engage on Twitter. Please SIGN and SHARE this petition to the new owner of Twitter, Elon Musk, asking him to reactivate LifeSiteNews\' truth-telling Twitter accounts which have been suspended since early 2021. They are: https://twitter.com/LifeSite\n\nhttps://twitter.com/LSNCatholic\n\nhttps://twitter.com/WCDM_LSN\n\nhttps://twitter.com/WCEA_LSN These accounts have been blocked by the outgoing Twitter regime for more than a year for calling a ‘transgender woman’ (Assistant Secretary of Health, \'Rachel\' Levine), a man, and for tweeting an article about the same person. The article we tweeted makes mention of the troubling paradox of having a person who denies the basic science of the human anatomy be in an authoritative position in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), but does not cast aspersions or any other such “hate speech” against Levine, according to Twitter’s "rules." It is our fervant hope that Mr. Musk intends to allow - rather than censor - our descriptions of reality as we know them to be true in regards to human sexuality, as well as in other areas of life. Mr. Musk evidently understands how significant freedom of speech is to the functioning of a free society as he was quoted as saying that this deal is important for "the future of civlization." LifeSiteNews believes that being able to spread the truth in charity is absolutely vital for the future of society, as the "truth shall make you free." (Jn 8:32) And so, in order for us to charitably spread the truth far and wide, we now seek to re-engage on Twitter\'s public square.

The New Democrats have cozied up to Trudeau in order to pretend they are a sane and legitimate party and have promised to prop up his regime. Promises don’t really mean anything when politicians make them, so we shouldn’t assume that the communists will be loyal to each other.\n\nHowever, it is obvious that public opinion is against Trudeau to a degree that he will not be able to withstand.\n\nThere is a reason why Trudeau had to resort to the Emergencies Act to squash the Freedom Convoy; no one wanted to stop it until they were forced to by law.\n\nThe various levels of provincial and municipal governance could have stopped the movement the way they stop any non-violent protest – but they didn’t want to.\n\nDoes this mean that the cops and all the citizens supported the convoy? Of course not, but I think that enough of them saw how absurd things have become and just wanted something to make the whole charade of 2020-2021-2022 go away.\n\nThe application of the Emergencies Act was wildly unpopular among Canadians, both on the Left and the Right. Leftists were happy to see the movement end but were unimpressed that Trudeau ended it in such an absurd way. Conservatives generally supported the movement, and therefore saw Trudeau as a complete lunatic for doing what he did.\n\nAll of this means that in the long run Trudeau is hurting his reputation, even among his base. This is not news for him as the Conservative leadership race heats up.\n\nFreedom is on the move\n\nWithout giving the impression that I think Canada is on the brink of some massive societal restoration, I would be remiss if I did not speak to the positives.\n\nCurrently, we are witnessing the first real Conservative leadership race in a long time. Pierre Pollievre is filling arenas and convention centres with freedom-loving crowds, and Leslyn Lewis is making leftist journalists look silly on national TV. It is worth remembering that we are talking about a leadership race, not an election, but the swell of right-wing uprising is palpable.\n\nIn fact, the last time something like this happened was after a groundswell of Christian/right-wing sentiment following years of leftist oppression under the former Trudeau and his successors.\n\nAs a result of that, we had Stephen Harper for a decade who, although not perfect, was a saint compared with Trudeau.\n\nThe economy is tanking in Canada, and goods and services are becoming prohibitively expensive for average people. Trudeau and his cronies can appeal to idealism and progressivism all they want, but even left-wingers get ticked off and want change when they are struggling to fill the tank.\n\nUltimately, Trudeau is continuing to trap vaccine-free Canadians from participating fully in society because he knows that if he pulls the plug on his last failing restriction, that his regime will go down the drain.\n\nKennedy Hall is an Ontario based journalist for LifeSiteNews.

We are open but on our conditions. At least we know what to tell him: ‘Elon, there are rules. You are welcome but these are our rules. It’s not your rules which will apply here," said Breton.\n\nMusk’s take-private deal for Twitter could transform the Tesla chief executive, who has used the platform to attack regulators and critics, into a social media baron, given that millions of people rely on the San Francisco-based platform for news. He said on Monday that “free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy” and described Twitter as “the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated”. -FT\n\nBreton\'s comments come just days after Brussels signed a major piece of legislation targeting big tech for not doing enough to police content online, which runs counter to Musk\'s plan to loosen Twitter\'s content moderation policies to match his stated "free speech absolutist" ideology that could even see the return of former President Donal Trump to the platform (despite Trump\'s insistence he won\'t be back).\n\nAccording to Breton, he\'s simply offering Musk a "reality check" over plans for less stringent moderation, as a lack of compliance risks a ban in Europe.\n\n"Anyone who wants to benefit from this market will have to fulfill our rules. The board [of Twitter] will have to make sure that if it operates in Europe it will have to fulfill the obligations, including moderation, open algorithms, freedom of speech, transparency in rules, obligations to comply with our own rules for hate speech, revenge porn [and] harassment," said Breton, adding "If [Twitter] does not comply with our law, there are sanctions — 6 per cent of the revenue and, if they continue, banned from operating in Europe."', 'image': 'https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2022-04/musk%202.jpg?itok=_6ovvCP5', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:12'}

Jody Hice (R-Ga.), in all caps. A Twitter survey by Sen. Ted Cruz asked if Musk’s purchase was a good thing, with the only options to answer being “yes” or “no, I hate free speech.” His fellow Texan, Rep. John Carter, signaled his approval with no words at all; three clapping-hands emojis were sufficient.\n\nA pot-smoking, meme-posting evangelist for electric vehicles may be an unlikely hero for conservatives. But the Tesla chief executive’s amorphous vow to restore free speech to the social media platform has resonated among Republicans, who see themselves — starting with their de facto leader, former President Trump — as unfairly targeted by Twitter’s content moderation efforts.\n\nConservatives said their euphoric outpouring was bigger than the possible return of @RealDonaldTrump and changes to Twitter’s ownership. Rather, they see Musk’s takeover as a symbolic, and cathartic, blow against Big Tech, which the right has increasingly viewed with antipathy.\n\n“There’s a gut reaction from a lot of people, going, ‘You know what, it’s about time they get their comeuppance,’ ” said Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.). “It finally feels like someone is standing up for a principle that has been going in an opposite direction lately: less free speech, less ability to express yourself — if you are a conservative.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk centered his bid for Twitter on the premise that the social media company, which he considers a “digital town square,” is too restrictive in clamping down on expression.\n\n“I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” Musk tweeted Monday morning.\n\nMusk’s own politics are idiosyncratic. He’s the foremost face of clean vehicles who called for immediately increasing oil and gas production after the Ukraine-Russia war spiked energy prices. He fled California for Texas because of high taxes but declined to weigh in on Texas’ restrictive abortion law, saying he preferred to “stay out of politics.” He has described himself as politically independent and registered to vote in California with no party preference.\n\nFor conservatives, Musk’s crusade against content restrictions has struck a chord. Roughly half of Republicans feel they cannot express themselves freely on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, according to a Morning Consult poll conducted this month, far exceeding the percentage of Democrats and independents who felt similarly.\n\nPolitics Who did Twitter ban during the Trump era, and why? Could banned Trump allies return to Twitter under Elon Musk? A look at the former president’s backers who were kicked off the social media platform.\n\n“Twitter is a platform that I and many others believe has been more aggressive in blocking Republicans and conservatives than they have toward people on the left,” said Rep. Austin Scott (R-Ga.). “I’m hoping and expecting he will undo that.”\n\nScott is not an avid Twitter user; he does not even have the app on his phone. But he did tweet a congratulatory message to Musk, adding a plea to “restore free speech and bring back President Trump!”\n\nTrump was permanently kicked off the platform on Jan. 8, 2021 — two days after a group of his supporters overran the U.S. Capitol in hopes of blocking the certification of Joe Biden’s win. Twitter imposed the ban “due to the risk of further incitement of violence.”\n\nSo far, Musk has not indicated how he’d handle the former president’s account. Trump, meanwhile, has shown no interest in rejoining the platform that helped power his political rise and gave real-time narration of his presidency.\n\n“I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,” Trump told Fox News, referring to his fledgling social media network. “I hope Elon buys Twitter, because he’ll make improvements to it, and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth.”\n\nRepublicans see Trump as just one example of Twitter’s bias. A number of high-profile conservatives have been suspended or blocked from the platform, including the account of the Babylon Bee, a satirical news website that was suspended for a tweet naming Assistant Health Secretary Rachel Levine, who is transgender, “Man of the Year.”\n\nThe account was locked as a violation of Twitter’s ban on hate speech. Seth Dillon, CEO of Babylon Bee, refused to remove the tweet, asserting that “truth is not hate speech.”\n\n“It’s completely broken,” said Harmeet Dhillon, a conservative lawyer who has sued Twitter multiple times on behalf of clients who were banned. “The company can try to affect elections, try to ban politicians from speaking ... use algorithms, enable false accounts to constantly affect what people see.”\n\nThe extent to which conservatives face bias on the platform has been fiercely examined and debated. A study this month by researchers at MIT and Yale found that Republican users tend to be suspended more often than Democrats but that conservatives are more likely to share misinformation that would provoke such suspensions.\n\nSo far, Musk has offered little explanation as to how his free speech values would play out in practice. He said on Monday that his goals include “enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots and authenticating all humans.”\n\nBut such efforts would require some attempt at regulating content, especially by verifying users. A social media network without any moderation at all could swamp the platform with all sorts of unsavory or offensive material, such as pornography or terrorist content, as well as the online abuse and harassment that are already common occurrences.\n\n“If you don’t have content moderation, you actually have less free speech. The people who are the loudest are the bullies and harassers that drive people away,” said Katie Harbath, a former Republican operative who has worked as public policy director for Facebook.\n\nDhillon, the conservative attorney based in California, said she is not hoping for Musk to completely abandon regulation.\n\n“There’s plenty of room for them to do old-school content moderation of the kind they originally did,” she said, citing as an example prohibitions on making death threats.\n\nWith Musk’s plans still unknown, Harbath, who now runs a tech policy strategy firm, said the celebratory conservatives “are making a hell of a lot of assumptions of what Elon means by all this stuff. I don’t think they should assume he is completely on their side.”\n\nRepublicans’ triumphant tone on Twitter starkly contrasted with the more muted reaction from liberal politicians. Far fewer Democratic members of Congress weighed in on Twitter, although those who did were markedly unenthused.\n\n“This deal is dangerous for our democracy. Billionaires like Elon Musk play by a different set of rules than everyone else, accumulating power for their own gain. We need a wealth tax and strong rules to hold Big Tech accountable,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), with whom Musk has sparred on Twitter.\n\nHuizenga, the Michigan congressman, expected that liberals would be none too pleased with Musk’s purchase. Indeed, some vowed to leave the site entirely — much to Huizenga’s amusement.\n\n“It seems like ‘I’m quitting Twitter’ has become the ‘I’m moving to Canada if Trump wins,’ ” he said, adding, “It’s kind of fun sitting back, watching them completely lose their collective minds.”', 'image': 'https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ac14b68/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2941x1544+0+208/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F86%2F23%2Ff46440b54bd7a6509db9c67caab5%2Fphilanthropy-billionaries-tax-28080.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:57'}

(Patrick Pleul/Pool/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nElon Musk Reveals More Details of His Plans for Twitter After Buyout\n\nElon Musk revealed more details of what he has in mind for changes at Twitter after it was confirmed that the company had accepted his buyout offer, with the tech mogul’s plans including new features and ways to enhance trust in the platform.\n\nTwitter’s board of directors said on April 25 that it had approved Musk’s offer to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share in cash, in a deal worth around $44 billion.\n\nThe buyout represents a 38 percent premium over Twitter’s closing stock price on April 1, with Parag Agrawal, CEO of Twitter, saying in a statement that he believes the deal “is the best path forward for Twitter’s stockholders.”\n\n‘Bedrock of a Functioning Democracy’\n\nIn a statement, Musk provided some details about what kind of changes he has in mind for the social media platform, whose commitment to free speech he has repeatedly called into question.\n\n“Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,” Musk said. This dovetails with his earlier statements that Twitter functions as a “de facto town square” where important conversations should be able to take place with as few constraints as possible.\n\nMusk said Monday that Twitter has “tremendous potential” and that he wants to work with the company and its users to “unlock” and make the platform “better than ever.”\n\nHe said he plans on “enhancing” Twitter with new features, which he did not provide further details on. Musk earlier created a Twitter poll asking users if they want an edit button on the platform, suggesting that this could be one of the changes he is seeking to effect.\n\nMusk also said on Monday he wants to make the platform’s algorithms “open source to increase trust,” while “defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.”\n\nThis, too, reinforces his earlier remarks that his objective in seeking to buy Twitter and turn it into a private company was to transform it into a bastion of free speech by opening up its algorithm to public scrutiny and by making its moderation policies more transparent.\n\n‘Black Box Algorithm’\n\nA self-described “free speech absolutist,” Musk told the audience at a recent TED event in Vancouver, Canada, that Twitter should permit unconstrained expression, though it should do so in line with the law.\n\n“In my view, Twitter should match the laws of the country,” Musk said, acknowledging reasonable legal caps on free speech like direct incitement to violence or shouting “fire” in a crowded theater.\n\n“But going beyond that and having it be unclear who’s making what changes to where, having tweets mysteriously be promoted and demoted with no insight into what’s going on, having a black box algorithm promote some things and not other things, I think this can be quite dangerous,” Musk said.\n\n“My strong, intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization,” he added.\n\nErr on Side of Free Speech\n\nMusk also expressed reluctance about permanent bans of users from Twitter, preferring instead temporary “time-outs.”\n\n“I’m not saying that I have all the answers here,” Musk said at the TED talk. But I do think that we want to be just very reluctant to delete things, just be very cautious with permanent bans. Timeouts I think are better than permanent bans.”\n\nIn terms of calibrating Twitter’s moderation policies, Musk said he’d want to err on the side of free speech.\n\n“If in doubt, let the speech, let it exist,” Musk said. “If it’s a grey area, I would say let the tweet exist. But obviously in a case where there’s perhaps a lot of controversy, that you would not want to necessarily promote that tweet.”\n\n“A good sign as to whether there’s free speech is, is someone you don’t like allowed to say something you don’t like,” Musk said. “And if that is the case, then we have free speech.”\n\n‘We Are Concerned’\n\nMusk has repeatedly questioned Twitter’s commitment to free speech, after accusations that the platform suppressed some minority and politically conservative viewpoints, claims Twitter has denied.\n\nMany free speech advocates have hailed Musk’s takeover bid, while those opposed have expressed fear that fewer constraints on expression on Twitter will make it too easy to abuse the platform’s reach and power by, for example, spreading disinformation.\n\nIn a series of tweets reacting to Musk’s takeover moves, Amnesty International expressed concern about the erosion of policies meant to protect users.\n\n“We are concerned with any steps that Twitter might take to erode enforcement of the policies and mechanisms designed to protect users,” Amnesty International wrote.\n\n“The last thing we need is a Twitter that wilfully turns a blind eye to violent and abusive speech against users,” the group said.\n\nAs it was confirmed Musk would purchase Twitter, the Tesla founder urged his “worst critics” to stay on the platform.\n\n“I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” he wrote in a Twitter post.\n\nDan Ives, an analyst at investment firm Wedbush Securities, told the BBC that he expects most users will take a “wait-and-see approach” on whether they stay or leave the platform, based on the changes that take place.\n\n“Now it’s about courting new users and stopping defectors from the platform,” Ives told the outlet.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/19/article-image-cal-thomas-3-1200x804.jpeg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:50'}

This feels like the first flashback scene we see in a dystopian drama after the words “SIX MONTHS EARLIER …” Quite where we’ll be in six months’ time as far as Twitter is concerned remains tantalisingly unclear, but it seems difficult to imagine it will be either a more or less pleasant space. It’s a social media platform. I’m not sure what further evidence humanity needs before we cotton on to the idea that such a thing might be an intrinsically toxic concept. Of course, there will always be some people who think it just hasn’t been done right yet. Like communism, or a British version of The Daily Show.\n\nAnyway, if Musk’s takeover goes through, he’ll assume control of a platform where the people on the right are incredibly angry about free speech, and those on the left are incredibly angry about hate speech. Which is to say: they have so much in common. As the tech visionary Jaron Lanier has long been excellent at pointing out, the best way to keep people on platforms is to make them angry. So the platforms are designed to make them angry. You might consider the anger worth it for your version of advertising (I myself will post this column on Twitter), but even then it is a weirdly grim cost of doing business that just conceivably ought to be weighed far more carefully than it is.\n\nUnlike the UK, Musk manufactures other things besides anger, but Twitter is the platform where, in a single calendar year, his posts led to multiple lawsuits, a fall in his stock price, and a Securities and Exchange Commission settlement that resulted in his chairmanship of Tesla being forcibly ended. Yet in a move that will feel familiar to a lot of Twitter users, he has not logged off, but leaned in further. When I was a child, there was a guy called Victor Kiam who owned Remington, and he would personally feature in the firm’s electric razor adverts, going: “I liked the shaver so much, I bought the company.” It would be nice to see Musk do something similar. “I liked calling innocent people paedos so much, I bought the company.”\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the distress of Twitter users feels overplayed. Perhaps Elon embodies a kind of radical honesty and self-awareness not shared by other denizens of the site. People who seem to spend half their lives complaining about Twitter, on Twitter, seem stunned by the idea that a shitposter would ultimately buy it. Catch up! It doesn’t feel like a complete coincidence that all social media platforms are owned by men you’d run a mile from socially.\n\nMusk is one of them – a brilliant, horrid, ridiculous and very occasionally endearing grotesque. A sort of intergalactically successful Dominic Cummings. And yet, despite Elon’s give-a-toss gift for making himself what Twitter users might call the “main character”, I can’t detest him entirely. If he pulls off the radical green energy transition embodied in Tesla, or even just one of his other wildly ambitious schemes, humans might have to accept some of the shit that’s gone with it. Accept it angrily, of course – how else, we’re on a social media platform! – but accept it nonetheless. A huge number of other people in public life behave appallingly and achieve absolutely nothing but harm.\n\nBut if endlessly righteous folk balk at the mere idea of necessary evils, why do they act like their own involvement in Twitter is one? It isn’t. It’s easy to focus on the high-profile people who are always on Twitter. But the sheer numbers of highly successful, highly creative and highly interesting people in the worlds of arts, business, science and beyond who AREN’T on it should tell a much more powerful story. They are part of all kinds of era-defining creative and commercial conversations and breakthroughs – and somehow manage to do it all without lavishing half the day scrolling past a bunch of other people having a row.\n\nLanier has cast detailed doubt on whether most Twitter advocacy is even meaningfully effective, despite sometimes appearing to be so. If you spend your day caught up in online fighting, it’s preferable to tell yourself you’re involved in consciousness-raising for your cause. An alternative view is that you are simply obsessively polarising your particular debate, to the point where compromise – boring, unfashionable, yet historically always necessary – becomes a more distant possibility.\n\nMy “unpopular opinion”, in one of Twitter’s tellingly popular phrases, is that those who spend a significant amount of time arguing on it work for the platform and not for their cause. The Musk takeover at least makes it easier to see whose pocket you’re putting money into as you delude yourself you’re winning arguments. I’m certainly not saying I follow this rule, but in general I think arguing on the internet is like playing real tennis: even if you win, you’re still a twat.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5899b28a3a52d992407b1aa95d2689c2b1d4703f/0_273_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=e4d7eefe6e510bd81cf93360935a1d81', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:53'}

In total, 317 officers of junior lieutenant rank and above have been killed in a little over two months of fighting, analysis by outlet MediaZona revealed today. Almost a third came from the most senior grades - major or above - including at least two generals and the deputy commander of Russia\'s Black Sea fleet. MediaZona, which is currently blocked in Russia but continues to operate online, compiled its data by looking at public reports of troop deaths from local government officials, newspapers, or families posting on social media. That means the figures will be far lower than the true total because of delays between the troops being killed and their deaths being reported, difficulties in identifying bodies, and deliberate cover-ups by Moscow. In total, MediaZona found 1,744 reports of military deaths in Ukraine - higher than the Kremlin\'s official figure of 1,351 which it has not updated since late March. It found 317 of those deaths were of officers, which accounts for almost a fifth of the total figure. MediaZona believes that is because officer deaths are more-likely to be reported than those of foot-soldiers. The highest-ranked deaths that Russia has acknowledged are of Andrei Sukhovetsky and Vladimir Frolov, who were both Major Generals. Russia has also acknowledged the death of Captain 1st Rank Andrei Paly, the deputy commander of its Black Sea fleet, MediaZona said.

Germany\'s defence industry has been offering to sell the Gepard vehicles to Ukraine since February, but had been blocked from doing so by Chancellor Olaf Scholz\'s government which led to outcry both inside and outside the country. Scholz, whose SPD party traditionally maintains close ties with Russia, had argued that it would take too long to train Ukrainian soldiers to use the weapons, that Germany had no weapons to sell, and that selling weapons could provoke Putin. But under strong pressure from Germany\'s international allies as well as his own coalition partners, Scholz now appears to have decided to change course. Lambrecht will today deliver a speech at Ramstein air base in which she will say the government has agreed to sign off the delivery of used Gepard anti-aircraft tanks. At the same time, a plan will be submitted to parliament calling for the government to \'continue and, where possible, accelerate the delivery of equipment to Ukraine.\' Equipment will be extended to include \'the delivery [of] heavy weapons and complex systems\', according to a draft of the document shown to AFP.

The blasts occurred in the small town of Maiac roughly 12 kilometers (7 miles) west of the border with Ukraine, just days after a Kremlin military chief warned that \'Russian-speakers\' had been \'oppressed\' there. A day earlier, several explosions believed to be caused by rocket-propelled grenades were reported to hit the Ministry of State Security in the city of Tiraspol, the region\'s capital.

Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai accused the Kremlin of systematically attacking electricity plants and water pumps to punish the local population. Last week officials in Luhansk said Russian forces had deliberately targeted the supply of food to the eastern region. They swamped the key city of Sievierodonetsk with missiles that wiped out all food depots, as well as markets and shops. The city’s 100,000 population has fallen by 17,000 and they are now reliant on aid supplies. Advertisement\n\nEvidence of Russian soldiers boobytrapping humanitarian aid packages for elderly Ukrainian residents comes as Kremlin insiders told The Financial Times that Putin has given up on peace talks with Ukraine and is intent on seizing as much land as possible.\n\nThe three insiders claimed that the Russian president wanted to grab territory because he felt negotiations had reached a \'dead end\'.\n\nOne insider said: \'There was hope for a deal. Putin was going back and forth. He needs to find a way to come out of this a winner.\'\n\n\'Putin sincerely believes in the nonsense he hears on [Russian] television and he wants to win big,\' another insider added.\n\nA third said he wouldn\'t sign anything after the humiliation caused by the sinking of the Moskva.\n\nA senior member of the Ukrainian delegation, Rustem Umirov, said: \'We continue the negotiation process. Primarily — to save more lives of our people.\'\n\n\'We will use all the political and diplomatic efforts to stop this bloodshed. But there are red lines we will never cross. Ukraine will never give up its people and its territories,\' he told The Times.\n\nMeanwhile, officials in the embattled Ukrainian city of Mariupol say a new \'200-yard mass grave\' has been identified north of the city that could contain hundreds of bodies.\n\nVladimir Putin has given up on peace talks with Ukraine as he wants to seize as much land as he can for Russia, according to Kremlin insiders\n\nEmergency management specialists and volunteers remove the debris of a theatre building destroyed in the course of Ukraine-Russia conflict in the southern port city of Mariupol\n\nSmoke rises above a plant of Azovstal Iron and Steel Works during Ukraine-Russia conflict in the southern port city of Mariupol\n\nMayor Vadym Boychenko said authorities are trying to estimate the number of victims in the grave about six miles north of Mariupol.\n\nThis would be the third after satellite photos released over the last few days have shown what appear to be images of other mass graves.\n\nOn Saturday, chilling satellite photos revealed a second mass grave near Mariupol - as Russian forces continued to pummel the last 2,000 Ukrainian defenders trapped in a steelworks in the city.\n\nThe photos from Maxar Technologies showed the site at a cemetery in the town of Vynohradne.

In total, 317 officers of junior lieutenant rank and above have been killed in a little over two months of fighting, analysis by outlet MediaZona revealed today. Almost a third came from the most senior grades - major or above - including at least two generals and the deputy commander of Russia\'s Black Sea fleet. MediaZona, which is currently blocked in Russia but continues to operate online, compiled its data by looking at public reports of troop deaths from local government officials, newspapers, or families posting on social media. That means the figures will be far lower than the true total because of delays between the troops being killed and their deaths being reported, difficulties in identifying bodies, and deliberate cover-ups by Moscow. In total, MediaZona found 1,744 reports of military deaths in Ukraine - higher than the Kremlin\'s official figure of 1,351 which it has not updated since late March. It found 317 of those deaths were of officers, which accounts for almost a fifth of the total figure. MediaZona believes that is because officer deaths are more-likely to be reported than those of foot-soldiers. The highest-ranked deaths that Russia has acknowledged are of Andrei Sukhovetsky and Vladimir Frolov, who were both Major Generals. Russia has also acknowledged the death of Captain 1st Rank Andrei Paly, the deputy commander of its Black Sea fleet, MediaZona said.

Now there is no such channel. Nobody is trying to create it.\'\n\nAmerica did set up a \'deconfliction line\' to Moscow in the early days of the Ukraine war, but said the Russia side stopped answering.\n\nLavrov also repeated warnings that shipments of western weapons into Ukraine will be considered legitimate targets by Russia - a day after missiles struck the country\'s train network in an apparent attempt to stop the deliveries.\n\nhe spoke as western nations shift focus in Ukraine from supplying small arms and defensive weapons such as anti-tank and anti-aricraft missiles, to providing heavier arms such as tanks, helicopters, aircraft and long-range artillery.\n\nThe move comes in response to calls from Kyiv to provide its armed forces with the means to recapture territory occupied by Russian forces, in the wake of atrocities carried out by Putin\'s men in places such as Bucha and Irpin.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin travelled to Kyiv on Sunday for a face-to-face meeting with President Zelensky to discuss supplies, before pledging another multi-million dollar shipment.\n\nAustin will also chair a meeting of more than 40 defence ministers at Ramstein air base in Germany today, aimed at securing additional supplies and coordinating efforts between allies to ensure Ukraine has everything it needs.\n\nAhead of the meeting, Austin stated the goal is to ensure Ukraine \'can win\' the war against Russia and \'weaken\' the country to the point where it cannot repeat its invasion a second time.\n\nAhead of the meeting, German media reported that the country will end weeks of dithering and agree to supply heavy arms to Ukraine in the form of 50 Gepard anti-aircraft systems.\n\nUkraine\'s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Monday night that he regards Russia\'s scaremongering as a sign of weakness.\n\nLavrov, speaking to Russian state TV, said tensions between east and west are now at a worse point than during the Cuban missile crisis at the height of the Cold War\n\nRussia considers western arms shipments to Ukraine legitimate targets for attack, Lavrov added, after the US pledged to send heavier weapons to the country this week (file image)\n\nMaria, 13, holds a photograph of her father Yurii Alekseev, 50, a territorial defence member who according to his family was killed by Russian soldiers, as she mourns him during his funeral today\n\nTetyana Boikiv, 52, right, meets and hugs her neighbour Svitlana Pryimachenko, 48, during a funeral service for her husband, Mykola Moroz\n\nGermany will finally authorise tank deliveries to Ukraine Germany will finally authorise the delivery of heavy weapons to Ukraine today after weeks of dithering that has tarnished its reputation on the world stage and led to questions about its commitment to European security. Defense minister Christine Lambrecht is expected announce the delivery of around 50 Gepard anti-aircraft vehicles to Ukraine during a meeting of more than 40 nations that will take place at Ramstein air base today. Germany\'s defence industry has been offering to sell the Gepard vehicles to Ukraine since February, but had been blocked from doing so by Chancellor Olaf Scholz\'s government which led to outcry both inside and outside the country. Scholz, whose SPD party traditionally maintains close ties with Russia, had argued that it would take too long to train Ukrainian soldiers to use the weapons, that Germany had no weapons to sell, and that selling weapons could provoke Putin. But under strong pressure from Germany\'s international allies as well as his own coalition partners, Scholz now appears to have decided to change course. Lambrecht will today deliver a speech at Ramstein air base in which she will say the government has agreed to sign off the delivery of used Gepard anti-aircraft tanks. At the same time, a plan will be submitted to parliament calling for the government to \'continue and, where possible, accelerate the delivery of equipment to Ukraine.\' Equipment will be extended to include \'the delivery [of] heavy weapons and complex systems\', according to a draft of the document shown to AFP. The same document will suggest that Ukrainian soldiers are brought to Germany and other NATO nations so they can be trained how to use the weapons.

Everything we do is calibrated to avoid direct confrontation with Russia.\'\n\nHeappey told Sky News that while NATO had been reinforcing its eastern flank, it was not, as an organisation, providing military aid.\n\n\'The donor community is not NATO,\' Heappey said. \'The donor effort is something that has been brought together by countries that are yes, many of them are from NATO, but others are from beyond ... it is not NATO that is doing the military aid.\'\n\nDuring a visit to Kyiv on Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin promised more military aid for Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. State Department on Monday used an emergency declaration to approve the potential sale of $165 million worth of ammunition to Ukraine.\n\nThe Pentagon said the package could include artillery ammunition for howitzers, tanks and grenade launchers.\n\nMoscow\'s ambassador to Washington told the United States to halt shipments, warning Western weapons were inflaming the conflict.\n\nLavrov said: \'NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy.

The explosions destroyed two powerful Soviet-era radio antennas that were re-broadcasting Russian stations in the region of Transnistria, an unrecognised Moscow-backed sliver of land bordering southwestern Ukraine, on Tuesday. The blasts occurred in the small town of Maiac roughly 12 kilometers (7 miles) west of the border with Ukraine, just days after a Kremlin military chief warned that \'Russian-speakers\' had been \'oppressed\' there. A day earlier, several explosions believed to be caused by rocket-propelled grenades were reported to hit the Ministry of State Security in the city of Tiraspol, the region\'s capital. No one was hurt in the explosions, officials said. On Tuesday, a military unit in the village of Parcani was also targeted. Officials did not offer any details on the incident, but declared a \'red level of terrorist threat\' and promised to impose additional security measures in the region.

In the face of mounting sanctions and fierce Ukrainian resistance bolstered by Western arms, Russia has kept up its long-distance bombardment and opened up a new offensive in the east. Some key events so far: February 24: Russia invades Ukraine from three fronts in the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two. Tens of thousands flee. Russian President Vladimir Putin says he is launching a \'special military operation\' to demilitarise and \'denazify\' Ukraine. Ukraine\'s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy tweets: \'Russia has embarked on a path of evil, but Ukraine is defending itself.\' February 25: Ukrainian forces battle Russian invaders in the north, east and south. Artillery pounds Kyiv and its suburbs and authorities tell residents to prepare Molotov cocktails to defend the capital. February 26: A U.S. defence official says Ukraine\'s forces are putting up \'determined resistance\'. February 28: The first talks between the two sides make no breakthrough. March 1: Russia hits a TV tower in Kyiv and intensifies bombardment of Kharkiv in the northeast and other cities, in what is seen as a shift in tactics as Moscow\'s hopes of a quick charge on the capital fade. A U.S. official says a miles-long Russian armoured column bearing down on Kyiv has not made any advances in the past 24 hours, bogged down by logistical problems. March 2: Russian forces bombard the southern port of Mariupol for 14 hours and stop civilians leaving, its mayor says - the start of Moscow\'s blockade of the city. Russia denies targeting civilians. Russian troops reach the centre of the Black Sea port of Kherson and claim their first capture of a large urban centre. March 3: Russia and Ukraine agree to set up humanitarian corridors for fleeing civilians. A cargo ship sinks near a Ukrainian port hours after another is hit by a blast at another port. A million people have fled Ukraine, the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR) says. March 4: Russian forces seize Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe\'s biggest. NATO rejects Ukraine\'s appeal for no-fly zones, saying it would escalate the conflict. March 6: \'Rivers of blood and tears are flowing in Ukraine,\' Pope Francis tells crowds in St. Peter\'s Square. \'This is not just a military operation, but a war, which sows death, destruction, and misery.\' March 8: Civilians flee the besieged city of Sumy in the first successful humanitarian corridor. Two million have now fled Ukraine, the UNHCR says. March 9: Ukraine accuses Russia of bombing a maternity hospital in Mariupol, burying people in rubble. Russia later says the hospital was no longer functioning and had been occupied by Ukrainian fighters. March 13: Russia extends its war deep into western Ukraine, firing missiles at a base in Yavoriv close to the border with NATO member Poland. The attack kills 35 people and wounds 134, a local official says. March 14: Russian journalist Marina Ovsyannikova bursts into a state TV studio during a live news bulletin, with a banner reading: \'NO WAR. Stop the war. Don\'t believe propaganda. They are lying to you here.\' March 16: Ukraine accuses Russia of bombing a theatre in Mariupol where hundreds of civilians are sheltering. Moscow denies it. March 25: Moscow signals it is scaling back its ambitions and will focus on territory claimed by Russian-backed separatists in the east, as Ukrainian forces go on the offensive to recapture towns outside Kyiv. March 29: Ukraine proposes adopting a neutral status during talks in Istanbul. March 30: More than 4 million people have fled Ukraine, the UNHCR says. April 1: Ukraine recaptures more territory around Kyiv from Russian soldiers who leave shattered villages and abandoned tanks as they move away from the capital. April 3/4: Ukraine accuses Russia of war crimes after a mass grave and bodies of people shot at close range are found in the recaptured town of Bucha. The Kremlin denies responsibility and says images of bodies were staged. April 8: Ukraine and its allies blame Russia for a missile attack on a train station in Kramatorsk that killed at least 52 people trying to flee the looming eastern offensive. Russia denies responsibility. April 14: Russia\'s lead warship in the Black Sea, the Moskva, sinks after an explosion and fire that Ukraine says was caused by a missile strike. Russia says the ship sank after an ammunition explosion. Washington believes the warship was hit by two Ukrainian missiles. April 18: Russia launches its assault on east Ukraine, unleashing thousands of troops in what Ukraine described as the Battle of the Donbas, a campaign to seize two provinces and salvage a battlefield victory. April 20: More than 5 million people have fled Ukraine, the UNHCR says. April 21: Putin declares the southeastern port of Mariupol \'liberated\' after nearly two months of siege, despite leaving hundreds of defenders holding out inside a giant steel works. April 22: A Russian general says Moscow wants to take full control of southern and eastern Ukraine. April 24: Antony Blinken and Lloyd Austin travel to Kyiv, becoming the highest-level US delegation to make the journey since war with Russia broke out April 25: Germany agrees to send anti-aircraft tanks to Ukraine, reversing earlier policy not to supply heavy weapons Advertisement\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Boobytrapped milk carton primed with a BOMB is given to grandmother by Russian soldier distributing \'humanitarian aid\' in Ukraine\n\nBy Ed Wight for MailOnline\n\nA Ukrainian grandmother has narrowly escaped death after a Russian soldier gave her a boobytrapped carton of milk loaded with explosives.\n\nIn a disturbing new twist to Putin\'s war on Ukraine, Russian soldiers are now pretending to hand out \'humanitarian aid\'.\n\nBut when the pensioner from the besieged city of Kherson went to open the screw top carton she noticed wires attached to the lid.\n\nFurther investigation revealed the wires led to a detonator.\n\nThe OAP\'s son told local media in.kherson.ua: \'My retired mother noticed that there was something wrong with this milk, as if someone had been drinking from it before, or if it was broken.\n\n\'She carefully unscrewed the cap and showed me what was there.\'\n\nThe boobytrapped milk carton contained a homemade explosive attached to a fishing line which when opened would detonate the bomb.\n\nA Ukrainian grandmother has narrowly escaped death after a Russian soldier gave her a boobytrapped carton of milk loaded with explosives.

Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai accused the Kremlin of systematically attacking electricity plants and water pumps to punish the local population. Last week officials in Luhansk said Russian forces had deliberately targeted the supply of food to the eastern region. They swamped the key city of Sievierodonetsk with missiles that wiped out all food depots, as well as markets and shops. The city’s 100,000 population has fallen by 17,000 and they are now reliant on aid supplies. Advertisement\n\nEvidence of Russian soldiers boobytrapping humanitarian aid packages for elderly Ukrainian residents comes as Kremlin insiders told The Financial Times that Putin has given up on peace talks with Ukraine and is intent on seizing as much land as possible.\n\nThe three insiders claimed that the Russian president wanted to grab territory because he felt negotiations had reached a \'dead end\'.\n\nOne insider said: \'There was hope for a deal. Putin was going back and forth. He needs to find a way to come out of this a winner.\'\n\n\'Putin sincerely believes in the nonsense he hears on [Russian] television and he wants to win big,\' another insider added.\n\nA third said he wouldn\'t sign anything after the humiliation caused by the sinking of the Moskva.\n\nA senior member of the Ukrainian delegation, Rustem Umirov, said: \'We continue the negotiation process. Primarily — to save more lives of our people.\'\n\n\'We will use all the political and diplomatic efforts to stop this bloodshed. But there are red lines we will never cross.

(John Fredricks/The Epoch Times)\n\nUCI Cyber Security Expert, Ex-CIA Analyst Weighs in on Putin, Ukraine War\n\nAs a former senior Soviet analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency as well as ex-advisor to President George W. Bush, then-National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, and other senior government officials, Bryan Cunningham—who is now the Executive Director of the Cybersecurity Policy and Research Institute at the University of California–Irvine—spent years studying Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn a recent interview with The Epoch Times, Cunningham weighed in on Putin’s war with Ukraine now entering its third month.\n\n“I believe we are in more danger now [than during the Cuban Missile Crisis],” he said. “There really is a measurable possibility of a nuclear war.”\n\nAccording to Cunningham, a year ago the likelihood of nuclear war was 1 percent. Now, he says that number is “likely in the double-digits, which is terrifying.”\n\nThis is partly due to Cunningham’s belief that Putin is “less stable” than Khruschev, the former Cold War Soviet leader who once challenged the United States to a missile “shooting match,” and that there is no one in Russia who can “check” Putin’s power or remove him from office.\n\nAdditionally, Cunningham said he believes Putin’s behavior mimics previous dictators, in addition to reports that he is isolating himself from advisors and foreign dignitaries both physically and politically.\n\n“Typically when you’re a dictator for that long, just like Stalin … or Hitler, you stop allowing people near you who will say anything that disagrees with you,” Cunningham said.\n\nAccording to Cunningham, who is also an attorney with the Los Angeles-based firm Zweiback, Fiset & Coleman, Ukraine is an all-or-nothing issue now for Putin.\n\n“I think he’s willing to do whatever it takes to, in his mind, win. I think he feels like this is his legacy now,” Cunningham said.\n\nHis “pessimism” about Putin, Cunningham said, stems from his orders to use tanks and live ammunition to attack the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine in early March, as well as Russia’s military doctrine of using progressively harsher methods including nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons to avoid losing the war, no matter the cost.\n\nA damaged administrative building of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine, in Enerhodar, the Zaporizhzhia region, Ukraine, on March 4, 2022. (Press service of National Nuclear Energy Generating Company Energoatom/Handout via Reuters)\n\nCunningham has two theories for why Putin waged the attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, including that Russia may not have the technological capacity to hack adversaries that we once thought, since it could have simply hacked the plant to shut it down.\n\nMore likely, however, Cunningham said he theorizes that when Putin used “extraordinary” military force on the plant, he risked “vaporizing” his own troops as well as half of Ukraine, a move Cunningham said was Putin’s way of telling the West: “I will do anything I have to to win this war.”\n\nCunningham projects that if Putin’s efforts are successful in Ukraine he will immediately invade other Eastern European states.\n\n“This is about as high-stakes a situation as the West has faced since World War II,” Cunningham said.\n\nTo prevent a third world war with Russia, Cunningham said, the U.S. needs to provide Ukraine with whatever military aid it requests, a move he said that has taken far too long.\n\nAs a cybersecurity expert, Cunningham additionally warned of the increased threat Russia poses to individuals and businesses in the U.S. through cyberattacks.\n\nTo combat this, Cunningham advises companies and individuals to update their cybersecurity software regularly and to proactively use multi-factor authentication when logging into online accounts such as email.\n\nWhen discussing what the media and politicians have “gotten wrong,” about Putin and the conflict, Cunningham said both have incorrectly assumed that the “Russian Oligarchs,” or wealthy businessmen in Putin’s inner circle, would overthrow him.\n\nAccording to Cunningham, there is a misconception these businessmen provide Putin with power and wealth, when they actually rely on him for their wealth by means of alleged corruption, and would, thus, never try to overthrow him.\n\n“I am convinced there is no limit to what Putin will do,” Cunningham said regarding the recent alleged murder-suicide of two Russian oligarchs and their families.\n\nCunningham stated it is far more likely that Putin planned their deaths as a warning to other businessmen in his circle of their possible fates if he is unhappy with them.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2020/10/04/UCI_Irvine_11_JF_092520201-1200x800.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:50'}

Several countries are also reestablishing their diplomatic missions in the capital — the latest being Britain — after having left ahead of the war. The Biden administration will be under pressure to follow suit. U.S. diplomats initially relocated to the western Ukrainian city of Lviv and then pulled out altogether to Poland.\n\nZelensky said he “expected specific things and specific weapons” when world leaders come, adding that he had seen an increase in both the amount and the speed of arms deliveries, especially from Washington.\n\n“They should not come here with empty hands,” he said before the arrival of the U.S. officials, adding that Ukraine should not be used as a prop for “tragic selfies.” “We will return all our land the moment we receive necessary arms.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Kramatorsk, one of the prime targets in Russia’s new phase of the assault, only a few dozen residents attended Easter midnight Mass at the Syvato-Troyitskyy church, a reflection of the tense, fearful atmosphere engulfing the city as the battles edge ever closer.

Measures included the instalment of military checkpoints at the entrances to the cities of the region and the cancellation of the annual 9 May victory day parade.\n\nBob Deen, an expert on Moldova and a senior research fellow at the Clingendael Institute thinktank, said it was difficult to know whether the recent incidents were a false-flag operation by Russia or genuine acts of sabotage by anti-Russian groups.\n\nBut he said recent Russian rhetoric pointed to some of the long-term goals Russia had in mind for Transnistria. “We have seen that the topic of Transnistria is becoming discussed more openly in the Russian public domain. Russian recent statements could be an indication of the ambitions Moscow has there.”\n\nAccording to Deen, it was unlikely that Russian forces would be able to stage an offensive toward the border with Moldova, given that Moscow was engaged in heavy fighting in the eastern Donbas region. To get to Transnistria, Moscow would need to stage an offensive toward Odesa, which has been hindered by the recent sinking of the Moskva cruiser, which forced Russian warships to move further away from Ukraine’s coast.\n\nDeen was also sceptical that Transnistria’s own forces, which number about 7,500 troops, would be used in an attack on Ukraine from its western border.\n\nSign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am\n\n“There is little appetite to fight in Ukraine among the Transnistrian troops as well as the general population in the region, many of whom are leaving towards Moldova to escape any potential violence.”\n\n“Similarly to Belarus, the region does not want to be fully dragged into this war,” he said, adding that the recent rhetoric by Moscow may be a ploy to get Ukraine to pull troops away from the Donbas towards its western border.\n\nWith Russian backing, Transnistria fought a war against Moldova in the early 1990s that left the territory with de facto independence and a permanent Russian garrison. Russian state media – widely available in Transnistria – have played a significant role in cementing pro-Russian attitudes in the enclave as Moldova has shifted towards the west under the leadership of its liberal president.\n\nLast week, Sandu signed into law a bill banning the orange and black striped ribbons of Saint George, which enjoy wide popularity in Russia as a way to show public support for the government and the military, a move that angered Russian officials. In the same bill, Sandu banned the prowar signs “Z” and “V”, first used by the Russian armed forces.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f556b4f5969aec1d82c542b66f8d60ada25ad610/2295_761_2774_1664/master/2774.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1b0b7007651a86b3db7c4c9a092cf731', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:37'}

Gen. Terry Wolff as the lead coordinator of security assistance for Ukraine, a role that streamlines communications between U.S. defense firms, the administration and allies and partners to make sure weapons get to the war-torn country.\n\nThe president also announced the nomination of a U.S. ambassador to Ukraine — a position that has been empty for three years — and Blinken said embassy staff are preparing to return to Kyiv.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nUS sending diplomats back to Ukraine\n\nFollowing Austin and Blinken’s trip, the Biden administration said it intends to return its diplomats to Ukraine in the coming days, with the goal of reopening its embassy in Kyiv over the next few weeks.\n\nAmerican diplomats fled across the border as the Russian military moved in and surrounded Kyiv, but Blinken told reporters that those officials would soon be returning.\n\n“We will have American diplomats back in Ukraine starting next week,” Blinken told reporters. “They’ll then start the process of looking at how we actually reopen the embassy itself in Kyiv.”\n\n“I think that will take place over a couple of weeks, would be my expectation. We’re doing it deliberately, we’re doing it carefully, we’re doing it with the security of our personnel foremost in mind, but we’re doing it.”\n\nRead more here.\n\nNAVY PROBES AIRCRAFT CARRIER DEATHS\n\nThe Navy is opening an investigation into the deaths of seven sailors assigned to the aircraft carrier USS George Washington, including three who were found dead in one week.\n\n“Admiral Daryl Caudle, commander, U.S. Fleet Forces Command, has directed Rear Admiral John Meier, commander, Naval Air Force Atlantic, to investigate and assess the reported deaths of Sailors assigned to the USS George Washington,” said Capt. Sarah Self-Kyler, a spokesperson for U.S. Fleet Forces Command, told The Hill in a statement on Monday.\n\nWhat will be examined: The investigation will include correlations, command climate and culture issues as well as the systemic relationships between them.\n\nCaudle also asked his staff to work with Naval Air Force Atlantic, the ship, and other Navy stakeholders to “better understand and assess the efficacy of the existing Total Sailor Fitness programs,” Self-Kyler said.\n\nA stark figure: Seven deaths have been reported on the George Washington over the past year, Lt. Cmdr. Commander Robert Myers, a spokesperson for Naval Air Forces Atlantic, told The Hill in a statement.\n\nFour of those deaths were reported last year, and the other three were reported this month when three sailors were found dead within a week of each other. One sailor was found unresponsive on April 15 onboard the ship, and the two other sailors had been found at locations off base on April 9 and 10.\n\nOf the seven deaths, one has been confirmed as suicide and three other apparent suicides are under investigation. Another death was attributed to post-COVID-19 complications, while another was determined to be health-related. The cause of the seventh death is undetermined.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nBiden presses Congress over vets’ toxic exposures\n\nPresident Biden urged Congress to pass legislation addressing toxic exposures in veterans after announcing that the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (VA) is taking action to help those who suffer harmful effects from having been exposed to substances.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, Biden announced that the VA is issuing a rule that would propose expanding health benefits to veterans suffering from nine rare respiratory cancers.\n\nBiden said that America agrees that supporting veterans is widely supported “no matter where we live or who we voted for in the last election.”\n\nEarlier: Biden first previewed the VA’s action in his State of the Union address last month, when he announced that the agency would take steps to expand care for veterans who suffer from nine rare cancers related to toxic chemicals.\n\nAn update: In a statement announcing the rule on Monday, the agency said it determined that there is “biological plausibility between airborne hazards and carcinogenesis of the respiratory tract — and the unique circumstances of these rare cancers warrant a presumption of service connection.”\n\nSome background: Burn pits were often used in areas like Southwest Asia and Afghanistan for open-air combustion of trash and other solid waste products. The VA believes that about 3.5 million veterans were exposed to these burn pits and qualify for care.\n\nThe Senate passed the Health Care for Burn Pit Victims Act in mid-February, which would expand VA health care for combat veterans who served after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and were exposed to toxic burn pits.\n\nThat legislation extends the period of eligibility for care from five years to 10 years following discharge and includes training on toxic exposures for VA employees, mandates clinical toxic exposure screenings and boosts federal research on the topic.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nON TAP FOR TOMORROW\n\nWHAT WE’RE READING\n\nThat’s it for today!

He added: “Bluster about the use of nuclear, the possible use of nuclear weapons is very dangerous and unhelpful. Nobody wants to see a nuclear war, nobody can win it.”\n\nA key ally of President Vladimir Putin, Nikolai Patrushev, the head of Russia’s security council, on Tuesday said the outcome of “the policies of the west and the Kyiv regime controlled by it would only be the breakup of Ukraine into several states” – an apparent attempt to blame the west for supporting the Zelenskiy government.\n\nAt the western conference, Germany promised it would send approximately 50 refurbished Gepard anti-aircraft missile launchers, leading to praise from the Pentagon chief after weeks of pressure on Berlin to step up its supply of heavy weaponry.\n\nIt was “a major decision” said Austin. “I think those systems will provide real capability to, for Ukraine,” he said, and added he believed the country’s defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, would “continue to look for ways to be relevant and provide the good capability to the Ukrainians”.\n\nBritain pledged a day earlier to send “a small number” of Stormer vehicles which carry Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles – while Canada said at the conference it would send eight armoured vehicles to help Ukraine. But there was no announcement of any commitment to send tanks.\n\nAlthough Nato has repeatedly said it will not enter the war to fight against Russia, western politicians have begun to say their goal is help Ukraine decisively defeat to its neighbour, so that it cannot threaten Kyiv or other neighbours.\n\nSign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am<br><br>\n\nEarlier this week Austin said that Russia should be “weakened to the point where it can’t do things like invade Ukraine” and when asked again about that statement on Tuesday, he offered a similar formulation.\n\n“We would like to make sure again, they don’t have the same type of capability to bully their neighbours that we saw at the outset of this conflict,” he said, highlighting that Russia’s “land forces have been attrited in a very significant way, casualties are pretty substantial, they’ve lost a lot of equipment.”\n\nPrior to the meeting, the US said that the total value of arms donated to Ukraine was $5bn, with the US accounting for $3.7bn. On Monday, the UK said it had already sent £200m worth of arms and had a budget to supply £500m if needed.\n\nThe UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said in a major speech on Tuesday night that the west will never feel safe again and Europe will experience untold further misery if Putin succeeds in Ukraine.\n\n“We cannot be complacent – the fate of Ukraine remains in the balance. And let’s be clear – if Putin succeeds there will be untold further misery across Europe and terrible consequences across the globe. We would never feel safe again. So we must be prepared for the long haul and double down on our support for Ukraine,” she said in the foreign secretary’s annual Mansion House speech.\n\nTruss, still seen as a frontrunner for the Conservative leadership if Boris Johnson resigns, called for a “recasting and rebooting” of the global security architecture “since it has failed Ukraine”, arguing the conflict could be a catalyst for change in the way the free world deters global aggressors.\n\n“I want to live in a world where free nations are assertive and in the ascendant … where freedom and democracy are strengthened through a network of economic and security partnerships … where aggressors are contained and moving toward a better path. This is the long-term prize: a new era of peace, security and prosperity.”', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/482f5d22c5b1a118c6252cf9e90f69da2dc76407/0_333_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c5f145a891e028f675469cd912d6369d', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:55'}

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)\n\nBiden Administration Urges Supreme Court to Let It Drop ‘Remain in Mexico’ Program\n\nThe Biden administration told the Supreme Court on April 26 that it should not have to continue operating the Trump-era “Remain in Mexico” program that required non-Mexican asylum-seekers arriving at the southern border to wait in Mexico for processing.\n\nThe case at hand is Biden v. Texas, court file 21-954. The high court agreed on February 18 to hear the case, an appeal from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. One hour was set aside for the hearing, but it ran 1 hour and 47 minutes.\n\nUpon assuming office, Biden halted enrollments in the program, part of the Migrant Protection Protocols enforced by then-President Donald Trump, which was created to discourage individuals from making fraudulent asylum claims.\n\nThese Migrant Protection Protocols, approved by Congress and signed into law during the Clinton administration, had not been acted upon until then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen announced in December 2018 that they would be implemented. She said the goal was to curtail the so-called catch-and-release system, in which individuals made fraudulent asylum claims, knowing they would be let into the United States and able to stay for years before their court appearance.\n\nUnder Biden, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a memorandum providing that, effective Jan. 21, 2021, it would “suspend new enrollments in the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), pending further review of the program. Aliens who aren’t already enrolled in MPP should be processed under other existing legal authorities.”\n\nDays later, Biden signed three new executive orders aimed at undoing Trump-era immigration policies. One of the documents, Biden said during a ceremony at the White House, “orders a full review of the previous administration’s harmful and counterproductive immigration policies, basically across the board.”\n\nBut in August 2021, at the request of Texas and Missouri, federal Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk of the Northern District of Texas, a Trump appointee, ordered the government to keep the MPP policy in effect until it was “lawfully rescinded.” The Biden administration had failed to properly justify ending the policy and failed to uphold a 1996 law requiring the detention of certain migrants, the trial court judge found. The 5th Circuit sided with the two states.\n\nU.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said during oral arguments at the Supreme Court that Biden’s Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas “exercised his statutory discretion to make a policy judgment” and “found that the benefits of MPP were outweighed by its domestic, humanitarian, and foreign policy costs.”\n\n“Yet, the lower courts ordered DHS to reinstate MPP in perpetuity, requiring ongoing negotiations with Mexico to send thousands of non-citizens into its territory. That was error,” Prelogar said.\n\nMayorkas “should be allowed to finally put his policy decision into effect,” she said.\n\nSection 1225 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) gives the DHS secretary “discretionary return authority … not a mandate,” she added. “Nothing in the statutory text or history compels DHS to use MPP.”\n\nNeither Texas nor Missouri have given examples of any official interpreting the section as a mandate. But on their interpretation of the law, “every presidential administration, in an unbroken line for the past quarter-century, has been in open violation of the INA,” Prelogar said.\n\n“The courts’ interpretation compels sensitive foreign policy negotiations and would require transformative changes to the government’s border operations,” she said. “If Congress had wanted to mandate those results, it would have spoken clearly.”\n\nResponding to Justice Clarence Thomas, Prelogar said the lower courts’ rulings intrude on the federal government’s foreign policy powers.\n\n“The particular interpretation of the statute that the district court adopted here implicates grave and serious foreign policy implications,” she said.\n\n“Of course, the executive branch has primary responsibility for managing foreign relations and conducting those kinds of negotiations. And I think that if Congress had intended to override the executive’s ordinary discretion that it enjoys with respect to that kind of foreign policy relationship, then, at the very least, it should have made that intent express in the statute.”\n\nThe federal official also said it is impossible to detain everyone who arrives at the southern border because Congress hasn’t allocated enough money to cover immigration detention beds.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts seemed to side with the states when he told Prelogar that while he was “sympathetic” to her concern that the government “can’t detain enough people,” that isn’t the Supreme Court’s problem.\n\n“You’re in a position where the facts have sort of overtaken the law,” Roberts said. “But, in that situation, what are we supposed to do? It’s still our job to say what the law is. And if we say what the law is and you tell us we can’t do anything about it, where do you think that leaves us?”\n\nTexas Solicitor General Judd E. Stone II said the law generally requires that the U.S. detain migrants or send them back to Mexico. If it lacks the resources to detain them, it should return them to Mexico so they can wait there for asylum processing, he said.\n\nThe Biden administration, Stone added, has admitted it is not complying with the immigration detention provisions of the INA.\n\n“Petitioners suggest that no administration, no executive, has fully complied with their detention obligations. That certainly doesn’t prove that past administrations assumed those obligations could be … shirked in the event that they preferred not to use one of Congress’s allowed statutory tools, but I have no reason to think that that’s incorrect.”\n\nJustice Thomas pushed back, saying: “Assuming you’re right, wouldn’t it be odd for Congress to leave in place a statute that would appear to be impossible to comply with?”\n\n“No, Your Honor,” Stone replied.\n\n“Congress … as my friends on the other side mentioned, had this mandatory detention obligation for over a century. It has added authorities to enable the executive to attempt to meet it additionally,” he said.\n\nIf Congress doesn’t provide enough money to enforce the provisions of the law, “Then the executive has to do the best it can … with the amount of money that’s been appropriated to it and the other lawful … authorities it’s been provided.”', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/03/24/AP20336723098928_1-1200x800-1200x800.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:34'}

We can\'t have countries, for instance, participating in controlled flow, where they\'re just allowing individuals to cross through without normal adjudication."\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas during a tour of the Panama Canal at the Miraflores Locks, in Panama City, Panama, on April 19, 2022.

"It\'s quite challenging in dealing with a country like Venezuela, where the diplomatic relations, if they exist at all, can be strained," Mayorkas told CBS News last week. "And so we have to be practical here in addressing the realities."\n\nFor its part, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has currently stationed 23,000 agents along the southwest border, according to Tuesday\'s memo, including 600 recently deployed personnel and law enforcement officers from across government agencies.\n\n"By May 23, we will be prepared to hold approximately 18,000 noncitizens in CBP custody at any given time, up from 13,000 at the beginning of 2021, and we have doubled our ability to transport noncitizens on a daily basis, with flexibility to increase further," the memo reads.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland told lawmakers Tuesday that both the Bureau of Prisons and U.S. Marshals Service will contribute resources to the border mission.\n\n"To be clear, we don\'t do border patrolling," Garland said, noting law enforcement under the purview of the Department of Justice is not trained for immigration enforcement. "But the Bureau of Prisons is going to make buses available for the transfers that Border Patrol needs assistance for. And the Marshall Service is going to be providing additional deputy U.S. Marshals to assist CBP at the border."\n\nThe Defense Department, meanwhile, will provide "rapid contracting support for air and ground transportation," according to a senior administration official, in addition to identifying potential locations for new temporary migrant holding facilities along the southwest border.\n\nOfficials also noted the Department of National Intelligence is "coordinating intelligence gathering and helping to support and strengthen our capability to get an early warning of migrant surges as they are building."\n\nDHS plans to expand the distribution of "age-appropriate" COVID-19 vaccines to migrants at two dozen CBP sites by May 23, in addition to its existing vaccination program for those in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody.\n\nOfficials also confirmed that MaryAnn Tierney, the regional administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, will soon transition out of her short-lived role, where she led the newly established "Southwest Border Coordination Center." The center was established in February, and Mayorkas appointed Tierney shortly thereafter. Officials have yet to formally announce Tierney\'s replacement.\n\nTuesday\'s memo acknowledged "historic levels of migration" to the U.S. border. Apprehensions of migrants along the southern border soared to 221,000 last month, a 22-year high.

Prelogar pointed to 8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(c), which says that the attorney general "may return" aliens from contiguous territory back to that territory while they await a hearing, which Prelogar argued was "not a mandate."\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas was quick to point to an earlier part of the statute, 8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(a), which says that if an immigration officer determines that a migrant "is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted" to the U.S., the migrant "shall be detained."\n\nSUPREME COURT AGREES TO HEAR APPEAL FROM TEXAS DEATH ROW INMATE RODNEY REED\n\n"The ‘shall,’ I think, they see as a baseline and then the others are—there’s limited discretion to parole or to do other things," Thomas said in reference to Texas, Missouri, and other states that are fighting to keep the policy. "It seems as though they think discretion is consumed by the ‘shall.’"\n\nThe parole and "other things," are discussed in 8 U.S.C. 1226(a), which says that in a case where a migrant is arrested and faces possible removal, the government has three options where they "may" detain them or release them on bail or parole.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts addressed the idea of the government not being able to comply with the law.\n\n"If you have a situation where you’re stuck because there’s no way you can comply with the law and deal with the problem there, I’m just wondering why’s that our problem?" he asked.\n\nPrelogar acknowledged that this was not the court’s problem, but that the court need not do anything but look at the lower court’s interpretation of the "may return" language of the statute, which resulted in an injunction keeping the administration from eliminating MPP.\n\n"All the court needs to say in this case is that the contiguous territory return provision does not carry the meaning that justified the district court’s injunction in this case," Prelogar said. Any other question of statutory meaning in other sections do not require the Supreme Court’s attention here, she argued.\n\nJudd Stone of the Texas Attorney General’s office argued before the court that the only ways to satisfy federal requirements regarding migrants: detain them, parole, or return them to the countries they came from.\n\nJustice Thomas, echoing what Prelogar said earlier, asked Stone if "any administration ever complied with 1225 under your reading?"\n\n"I assume not," Stone said. When Thomas asked if it was "odd" for Congress to pass a law that the government could not follow, Stone said no, and that there has been a mandatory detention requirement "for over a century."\n\nIf Congress did not provide the resources for an administration to fully comply, it was up to the executive branch "to do the best it can."\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe case is being heard at a time when the Biden administration is in the process of reversing another Trump-era immigration border policy, the Title 42 public health order that allows for expedited removal of migrants arriving from countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPresident Biden said he was lifting Title 42 as of May 23, resulting in a lawsuit from a number of states.

Elizabeth B. Prelogar, representing the administration, argued there was no way the government could detain so many asylum seekers for months or years. She cited a report that said there were 220,000 migrants apprehended at or near the border in March but only 32,000 beds in detention facilities.\n\n“No one disputes that the DHS [Department of Homeland Security] does not have sufficient detention capacity” to hold all those migrants, she said.\n\nThe government’s only reasonable option, she said, was to release most of them if they are judged likely to return when their asylum claim is due to be heard.\n\nJustice Brett M. Kavanaugh questioned whether that’s what Congress intended. Is there any hint “that anyone in Congress expected that if there was not sufficient detention capacity that hundreds of thousands of people would be paroled into the United States without being lawfully admitted?” he asked.\n\nChief Justice John G.

Its officials did so believing the move would deter more migrants from traveling north.\n\nImmigrant rights advocates argued that Trump’s policy was cruel and inhumane. They said it forced tens of thousands of people from Central America to live in squalid conditions subject to violence and abuse. Upon taking office, President Biden said he planned to repeal Trump’s policy.\n\nBut state lawyers for Texas and Missouri sued and last year won nationwide orders from judges that required the new administration to maintain the prior Trump policy. The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the order in the Texas case.\n\nIn August of last year, the justices by a 6-3 vote refused an emergency appeal seeking to overturn the judge’s orders. And there was no clear sign during Tuesday’s argument the majority will do so now.\n\nTraditionally, the court has given the executive branch broad authority to enforce the immigration laws, including reversing the policies of prior administrations.\n\nPrelogar said it would be a radical departure for the court to say the new administration must maintain the new policies put in place by the prior administration. Prior to 2019, no administration or member of Congress had asserted the immigration law required the government to detain every noncitizen who had a pending asylum claim, she said.\n\nBut lurking in the background is the long legal fight over DACA, the Obama-era policy of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. President Obama used his authority under the immigration laws to suspend enforcement against young people who were brought illegally to this country when they were children.\n\nTrump moved to repeal that policy, but judges in California and New York put the repeal on hold. Lawyers for Trump argued the new president had ample authority to revoke a discretionary enforcement policy adopted by Obama.\n\nTwo years ago, however, the Supreme Court by a 5-4 vote ruled against Trump and blocked the repeal.\n\nNow in the case of Biden vs. Texas, the justices will rule on whether the new administration is free to repeal Trump’s “Remain in Mexico” policy.\n\nA decision can be expected by late June.', 'image': 'https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7f7a67b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb5%2Fde%2Fa50bba424e1eb301ca3265187af2%2F914957-na-pol-0210-supreme-court-kkn-11150.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:25'}

The public health order, which has been used by both the Biden and Trump administrations to expel a majority of migrants at the border due to the COVID-19 pandemic, will end on May 23.\n\nRepublicans and moderate Democrats have sounded the alarm about a massive surge in migration at the border on top of the already sky-high numbers that the administration has itself called "historic." DHS has been planning for up to 18,000 migrants a day and the current March numbers of 210,000 a month are expected to increase in the months ahead.\n\nDemocratic senators in particular have called for the Biden administration to have a plan in place before Title 42 is lifted and have introduced legislation in an attempt to make the administration implement such a plan. DHS has protested that it does, in fact, have a plan for the coming surge.\n\nThe six-step plan released by the administration involves the surging of resources, including medical support and transportation to the border, as well as initiatives to streamline the processing of migrants from the border to their release into the interior of the United States.\n\nHowever, the agency claims it is also administering consequences for unlawful entry, including the use of Expedited Removal (ER), which can allow for the rapid removal of recently arrived illegal immigrants. However, Border Patrol agents have told Fox News that if a migrant claims they have a fear of persecution, the removal order is changed to a Notice to Appear – meaning they are released into the United States with a future court date.\n\nThey said that migrants are already spreading the word about what to say to get released into the U.S. as the administration has already been increased its use of ER to remove illegal immigrants from Northern Triangle countries.\n\nA senior administration official, in a call with reporters, said there was no plan to use family detention as a way to help deal with the surge. However, the use of ER would allow for the use of detention for single adults. The administration has also stressed that it intends to remove "promptly" those who are allowed in, go through immigration proceedings, and are found not to have a valid asylum case.\n\nThe other pillars of the administration’s plan includes bolstering the capacity of non-governmental organizations to receive migrants after they’ve been processed by Customs and Border Protection (CBP). NGOs often help migrants with travel, housing and other assistance after they are released.\n\nFinally, the administration say it will target and disrupt transnational criminal organizations who facilitate illegal immigration, and also deter illegal migration throughout the Hemisphere. It pointed to new migration agreements with Panama and Costa Rica, as well as "close cooperation with Mexico."\n\n"We are also sending a clear message in the region to counteract misinformation from smugglers, including that the termination of the Title 42 public health Order does not mean that the U.S. border is open," the memo says.\n\n58-MEMBER BIPARTISAN HOUSE PROBLEM SOLVERS CAUCUS BACKS BILL TO EXTEND TITLE 42\n\nMayorkas ends the memo by admitting that the migrant surge will "substantially strain" resources at the border, and instead calls on Congress to pass solutions to fix what the administration has claimed is a "broken" system.\n\n"Despite the efforts of our dedicated DHS workforce and our partners executing this comprehensive plan, a significant increase in migrant encounters will substantially strain our system even further," he says.\n\n"As it has since its first day in office, the Biden-Harris Administration continues to call on Congress to pass legislation that holistically addresses the root causes of migration, strengthens border security, fixes our immigration system, and improves legal pathways," the memo says.\n\nThat legislation was quickly rejected by Republicans early last year due to its inclusion of a mass amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants in the country, combined with a lack of border security measures.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRepublican states have sued the Biden administration in a bid to stop the order being lifted on May 23.

Texas, is the decision last year by President Biden\'s appointees to suspend and ultimately end the policy, which the Trump administration utilized to require 70,000 Latin American migrants to wait outside the U.S. while their asylum requests were reviewed.\n\nFormally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, the Trump administration scaled back the rule at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and Mr. Biden ordered it ended upon taking office. In August 2021, Republican officials in Texas convinced a federal judge to order U.S. border officials to reinstate the program.\n\nIn his ruling, which was later upheld by a federal appeals court, U.S. Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee, said the administration did not adequately justify Remain in Mexico\'s termination and that the policy\'s end led officials to violate a 1996 law that requires the detention of certain migrants. The Biden administration has been implementing the policy since December, albeit in a limited fashion.\n\nThe justices on Tuesday expressed concern about whether Texas should be able to dictate federal policy involving foreign diplomacy and acknowledged that officials can\'t logistically detain all border-crossers. But the justices also questioned whether the administration has the authority to release large groups of migrants instead of detaining them or returning them to Mexico.\n\nThe Justice Department, which asked the Supreme Court to intervene in the case on an expedited basis, argued Tuesday that the executive branch has broad authority to rescind policies enacted by previous administrations, especially those that implicate foreign relations.\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who represented the administration, said the conclusions reached by the lower courts would mean that every U.S. administration has been violating the 1996 migrant detention law since only Trump implemented the Remain in Mexico policy, and not until early 2019.\n\nPrelogar also noted it is logistically impossible to detain all migrants who reach the U.S.-Mexico border since Congress has only allocated funds for fewer than 40,000 immigration detention beds.\n\n"The secretary should finally be allowed to put his policy decision into effect," Prelogar told the justices, referring to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas\' decision to end Remain in Mexico in June 2021.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts told Prelogar he was "sympathetic" toward the position that the government can\'t detain all border-crossers. But he questioned whether releasing large groups of migrants complies with federal law.\n\n"You\'re in a position where the facts have sort of overtaken the law," Roberts said. "But in that situation, what are we supposed to do? It\'s still our job to say what the law is."\n\nA group of migrant families from Central America walk alongside the border wall between the U.S. and Mexico after crossing into the U.S. near the city of Sasabe, Arizona, on Sunday, January 23, 2022.

If the U.S. cannot detain migrants because of capacity limits, he argued, it should be returning them to Mexico so they can wait there for the duration of their asylum cases.\n\nJudd acknowledged the government\'s inability to detain all migrants, but said Remain in Mexico\'s enforcement ensures there are "fewer" violations of the 1996 detention law at the center of the case. He said the policy mitigates concerns about detention limits because it deters migrants from crossing the border and in turn, leads to fewer migrants entering U.S. custody.\n\nThe specific questions the Supreme Court considered are whether it should overturn the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals\' conclusion that officials need to enforce Remain in Mexico to comply with the 1996 migrant detention law, and whether the appeals court should have considered the Biden administration\'s second attempt to end the policy. The high court could issue a ruling this summer.\n\nIn its ruling in December upholding the original order against Remain in Mexico\'s termination, the 5th Circuit rejected the argument that a second termination memo by Mayorkas remedied the alleged legal defects of his first termination memo.\n\n"DHS claims the power to implement a massive policy reversal — affecting billions of dollars and countless people — simply by typing out a new Word document and posting it on the internet," the court said in its scathing opinion.\n\nSince reinstating the rule in December, the Biden administration has enrolled 3,012 migrants in the Remain in Mexico program, most of them asylum-seekers from Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela, DHS data show. During that period, U.S. officials along the southern border have processed migrants over 700,000 times.\n\nWhile Mr. Biden has sought to end the Remain in Mexico rules, his administration kept another Trump-era border policy, known as Title 42, that has allowed U.S. officials to swiftly expel migrants without screening them for asylum due to the pandemic. Title 42 is set to expire in late May.\n\nThe Trump administration\'s implementation of Remain in Mexico elicited strong criticism from advocates for migrants, who said the rule left asylum-seekers at the mercy of criminal groups in dangerous Mexican border towns. Human Rights First, a U.S. group, reported hundreds of cases of migrants being kidnapped, assaulted or otherwise harmed after their return to Mexico.\n\nAdvocates also said the program trampled on the due process of asylum-seekers. Fewer than 800 migrants enrolled in the Remain in Mexico protocols were granted U.S. refuge, while tens of thousands lost their cases or were ordered deported for missing court dates, an analysis of government data by Syracuse University\'s TRAC project shows.\n\nBut Trump administration officials said the program effectively reduced border arrivals by preventing migrants fleeing economic hardship from using the asylum system to live and work in the U.S. indefinitely.\n\nThe Biden administration made significant changes to its iteration of the Remain in Mexico program, including by requiring U.S. border officials to ask migrants whether they fear being harmed in Mexico before sending them there.\n\nThe administration has also offered COVID-19 vaccines to prospective enrollees and expanded the categories of asylum-seekers deemed to be too vulnerable to be returned to Mexico, including the elderly, those with medical conditions and members of the LGBTQ community.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/04/26/a7750838-5c2c-4777-9b54-d74c13deb9dc/thumbnail/1200x630g2/95f12f52e2f09710ab3f0c8d30e94f75/gettyimages-1240238081.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:27'}

The announcement set off a firestorm that has only spread since then as a growing number of moderate Democrats, traditional allies and key chairmen have distanced themselves from the decision.\n\nThe administration has defended the move, and Mayorkas, during a CBS News interview last week, pledged that his department has a plan to respond to an expected increase in the number of migrants at the border.\n\n“The assertion that we do not have plans is an assertion that is not grounded in fact,” Mayorkas said. “We have been planning for months to address increases in migration; those that we already have experienced and those that we might experience upon an end to Title 42.”\n\nBut that’s done little to assuage concerns from congressional Democrats, marking one of the most significant and high-profile breaks between the two sides of Pennsylvania Avenue during Biden’s tenure.\n\nUnderscoring the pressure that the administration is under, Mayorkas, in addition to his committee testimony, will brief a bipartisan group of lawmakers privately on a call on Tuesday, a source confirmed to The Hill.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who has been critical of the administration’s decision, told The Hill that he hadn’t heard from the administration and remained opposed to lifting Title 42.\n\n“I don’t think Title 42 should be done until we have an immigration bill that works or the pandemic, the COVID, is no longer a threat,” Manchin said.\n\nThe politics are complicated for Democrats.\n\nA Politico-Morning Consult poll released earlier this month found that while only 26 percent of Democrats opposed Biden’s Title 42 decision, 52 percent of independents, the voters Democrats could need to win key Senate battles this November, were against the move.\n\nA Gallup poll released this month, but conducted before the CDC announced that it would roll back the border rule, found that 41 percent of Americans worried a “great deal” about “illegal immigration,” while an additional 19 percent worried a “fair amount” about it.\n\nThat breakdown is skewed along party lines.\n\nOnly 41 percent of Democratic respondents, but 56 percent of independents, said they worried about illegal immigration a “great deal” or a “fair amount.”\n\nRepublicans are eager to use the administration’s Title 42 decision against vulnerable Democrats in November as they view immigration as a key part of their midterm message.\n\nRep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), who is facing a progressive primary challenger, told “Fox News Sunday” that the administration’s decision to lift Title 42 has border communities “very concerned.”\n\n“They’re not only public officials but other folks, and none of them said, ‘Yes, go ahead and lift Title 42,’” Cuellar said. “And none of them said, ‘Open up the border.’ They are very concerned because they are on the front lines, and they’re the ones I think we need to listen to.”\n\nThe fight over the border policy has also snagged a separate agreement on $10 billion in coronavirus aid, as Republicans demand a vote to tie Title 42 to the coronavirus assistance.\n\nThe proposal, from Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), would effectively block the administration from rescinding the Trump-era rule as long as the broader coronavirus public health emergency remains in place.\n\nDemocrats could defeat Lankford’s amendment if they were unified — but they aren’t. Five Democratic senators have backed the legislation. Republicans believe they would need only a simple majority, meaning the support of one Democratic senator, for it to get added to the coronavirus bill.\n\nAny move by the administration to try to keep Title 42 in place would likely spark fierce pushback from a coalition of Democratic lawmakers and immigration advocates who long pushed for Biden to get rid of the Trump-era rule, viewing it as inhumane. Those same Democrats have been frustrated by their colleagues who have criticized rescinding it, arguing that they are mirroring GOP talking points.\n\nMembers of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) met at the White House with Biden on Monday.\n\n“I made clear to the President and his team that in order to follow through on a promise to create a just and humane immigration system – Title 42 must end on May 23rd and they should be clear that they do not support legislation to extend the end-date,” CHC Deputy Chair Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.) said in a statement.\n\nThe administration is also facing a legal challenge to its decision to lift the Trump-era rule, raising the prospect that it could get caught up in the courts. A federal judge in Louisiana on Monday issued a temporary restraining order to keep Title 42 in place past May 23.\n\n“I’d like to see a plan from the administration. The courts is separate from what we do here,” said Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), when asked about the court decision.\n\nThe administration is signaling that it’s effectively kicking the question of whether to delay the lifting of the CDC rule, or keep it together, to Congress, which has struggled repeatedly in recent years to reach any consensus on immigration or the border.\n\n“Congress would have to take action in order for the date not to be May 23,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/mayorkasalejandro_092121gn_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:44'}

Administration officials have ruled out detaining migrant families with children, telling reporters Tuesday the practice started under President Barack Obama and expanded under President Donald Trump "is not a tool we are considering now."\n\nThe planned expansion of expedited removal could be restricted by some countries\' refusal to accept U.S. deportations. An administration official said the U.S. is hoping to forge new repatriation collaboration agreements with certain countries that would cut red tape for carrying out deportations.\n\nU.S. officials have historically struggled to return large numbers of migrants to certain countries like Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela due to strained relations with their respective governments. In March, a record 32,000 Cubans and 16,000 Nicaraguans entered U.S. border custody, according to CBP data.\n\nAdministration officials characterized last week\'s diplomatic summit with Cuba as "productive," and "the beginning of a good dialogue." The U.S. delegation requested that Cuba once again accept Cuban deportees, while the U.S. agreed to restart immigrant visa processing in Havana, officials said.\n\nThe Biden administration is also asking countries that migrants transit through to help the U.S. reduce the number of arrivals to the Mexican border.\n\n"We\'re also asking that other countries step up and enforce their own immigration laws," one senior administration official said. "We really feel as though we need true responsibility sharing. We can\'t have countries, for instance, participating in controlled flow, where they\'re just allowing individuals to cross through without normal adjudication."\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas during a tour of the Panama Canal at the Miraflores Locks, in Panama City, Panama, on April 19, 2022.

"It\'s quite challenging in dealing with a country like Venezuela, where the diplomatic relations, if they exist at all, can be strained," Mayorkas told CBS News last week. "And so we have to be practical here in addressing the realities."\n\nFor its part, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has currently stationed 23,000 agents along the southwest border, according to Tuesday\'s memo, including 600 recently deployed personnel and law enforcement officers from across government agencies.\n\n"By May 23, we will be prepared to hold approximately 18,000 noncitizens in CBP custody at any given time, up from 13,000 at the beginning of 2021, and we have doubled our ability to transport noncitizens on a daily basis, with flexibility to increase further," the memo reads.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland told lawmakers Tuesday that both the Bureau of Prisons and U.S. Marshals Service will contribute resources to the border mission.\n\n"To be clear, we don\'t do border patrolling," Garland said, noting law enforcement under the purview of the Department of Justice is not trained for immigration enforcement. "But the Bureau of Prisons is going to make buses available for the transfers that Border Patrol needs assistance for. And the Marshall Service is going to be providing additional deputy U.S. Marshals to assist CBP at the border."\n\nThe Defense Department, meanwhile, will provide "rapid contracting support for air and ground transportation," according to a senior administration official, in addition to identifying potential locations for new temporary migrant holding facilities along the southwest border.\n\nOfficials also noted the Department of National Intelligence is "coordinating intelligence gathering and helping to support and strengthen our capability to get an early warning of migrant surges as they are building."\n\nDHS plans to expand the distribution of "age-appropriate" COVID-19 vaccines to migrants at two dozen CBP sites by May 23, in addition to its existing vaccination program for those in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody.\n\nOfficials also confirmed that MaryAnn Tierney, the regional administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, will soon transition out of her short-lived role, where she led the newly established "Southwest Border Coordination Center." The center was established in February, and Mayorkas appointed Tierney shortly thereafter.

Prelogar pointed to 8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(c), which says that the attorney general "may return" aliens from contiguous territory back to that territory while they await a hearing, which Prelogar argued was "not a mandate."\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas was quick to point to an earlier part of the statute, 8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(a), which says that if an immigration officer determines that a migrant "is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted" to the U.S., the migrant "shall be detained."\n\nSUPREME COURT AGREES TO HEAR APPEAL FROM TEXAS DEATH ROW INMATE RODNEY REED\n\n"The ‘shall,’ I think, they see as a baseline and then the others are—there’s limited discretion to parole or to do other things," Thomas said in reference to Texas, Missouri, and other states that are fighting to keep the policy. "It seems as though they think discretion is consumed by the ‘shall.’"\n\nThe parole and "other things," are discussed in 8 U.S.C. 1226(a), which says that in a case where a migrant is arrested and faces possible removal, the government has three options where they "may" detain them or release them on bail or parole.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts addressed the idea of the government not being able to comply with the law.\n\n"If you have a situation where you’re stuck because there’s no way you can comply with the law and deal with the problem there, I’m just wondering why’s that our problem?" he asked.\n\nPrelogar acknowledged that this was not the court’s problem, but that the court need not do anything but look at the lower court’s interpretation of the "may return" language of the statute, which resulted in an injunction keeping the administration from eliminating MPP.\n\n"All the court needs to say in this case is that the contiguous territory return provision does not carry the meaning that justified the district court’s injunction in this case," Prelogar said. Any other question of statutory meaning in other sections do not require the Supreme Court’s attention here, she argued.\n\nJudd Stone of the Texas Attorney General’s office argued before the court that the only ways to satisfy federal requirements regarding migrants: detain them, parole, or return them to the countries they came from.\n\nJustice Thomas, echoing what Prelogar said earlier, asked Stone if "any administration ever complied with 1225 under your reading?"\n\n"I assume not," Stone said. When Thomas asked if it was "odd" for Congress to pass a law that the government could not follow, Stone said no, and that there has been a mandatory detention requirement "for over a century."\n\nIf Congress did not provide the resources for an administration to fully comply, it was up to the executive branch "to do the best it can."\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe case is being heard at a time when the Biden administration is in the process of reversing another Trump-era immigration border policy, the Title 42 public health order that allows for expedited removal of migrants arriving from countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPresident Biden said he was lifting Title 42 as of May 23, resulting in a lawsuit from a number of states.

Elizabeth B. Prelogar, representing the administration, argued there was no way the government could detain so many asylum seekers for months or years. She cited a report that said there were 220,000 migrants apprehended at or near the border in March but only 32,000 beds in detention facilities.\n\n“No one disputes that the DHS [Department of Homeland Security] does not have sufficient detention capacity” to hold all those migrants, she said.\n\nThe government’s only reasonable option, she said, was to release most of them if they are judged likely to return when their asylum claim is due to be heard.\n\nJustice Brett M. Kavanaugh questioned whether that’s what Congress intended. Is there any hint “that anyone in Congress expected that if there was not sufficient detention capacity that hundreds of thousands of people would be paroled into the United States without being lawfully admitted?” he asked.\n\nChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. agreed the administration’s position would permit unlimited number of migrants to be admitted and released.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“There aren’t enough beds in detention. So there is no limit, as you read the statute, to the number of people that you can release into the United States, right?” he told the solicitor general.\n\nIn 2019, the Trump administration chose a different option and sent many of the Central American migrants back to the Mexican side of the border. Its officials did so believing the move would deter more migrants from traveling north.\n\nImmigrant rights advocates argued that Trump’s policy was cruel and inhumane. They said it forced tens of thousands of people from Central America to live in squalid conditions subject to violence and abuse. Upon taking office, President Biden said he planned to repeal Trump’s policy.\n\nBut state lawyers for Texas and Missouri sued and last year won nationwide orders from judges that required the new administration to maintain the prior Trump policy. The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the order in the Texas case.\n\nIn August of last year, the justices by a 6-3 vote refused an emergency appeal seeking to overturn the judge’s orders. And there was no clear sign during Tuesday’s argument the majority will do so now.\n\nTraditionally, the court has given the executive branch broad authority to enforce the immigration laws, including reversing the policies of prior administrations.\n\nPrelogar said it would be a radical departure for the court to say the new administration must maintain the new policies put in place by the prior administration. Prior to 2019, no administration or member of Congress had asserted the immigration law required the government to detain every noncitizen who had a pending asylum claim, she said.\n\nBut lurking in the background is the long legal fight over DACA, the Obama-era policy of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. President Obama used his authority under the immigration laws to suspend enforcement against young people who were brought illegally to this country when they were children.\n\nTrump moved to repeal that policy, but judges in California and New York put the repeal on hold. Lawyers for Trump argued the new president had ample authority to revoke a discretionary enforcement policy adopted by Obama.\n\nTwo years ago, however, the Supreme Court by a 5-4 vote ruled against Trump and blocked the repeal.\n\nNow in the case of Biden vs. Texas, the justices will rule on whether the new administration is free to repeal Trump’s “Remain in Mexico” policy.\n\nA decision can be expected by late June.', 'image': 'https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7f7a67b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb5%2Fde%2Fa50bba424e1eb301ca3265187af2%2F914957-na-pol-0210-supreme-court-kkn-11150.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:25'}

The public health order, which has been used by both the Biden and Trump administrations to expel a majority of migrants at the border due to the COVID-19 pandemic, will end on May 23.\n\nRepublicans and moderate Democrats have sounded the alarm about a massive surge in migration at the border on top of the already sky-high numbers that the administration has itself called "historic." DHS has been planning for up to 18,000 migrants a day and the current March numbers of 210,000 a month are expected to increase in the months ahead.\n\nDemocratic senators in particular have called for the Biden administration to have a plan in place before Title 42 is lifted and have introduced legislation in an attempt to make the administration implement such a plan. DHS has protested that it does, in fact, have a plan for the coming surge.\n\nThe six-step plan released by the administration involves the surging of resources, including medical support and transportation to the border, as well as initiatives to streamline the processing of migrants from the border to their release into the interior of the United States.\n\nHowever, the agency claims it is also administering consequences for unlawful entry, including the use of Expedited Removal (ER), which can allow for the rapid removal of recently arrived illegal immigrants. However, Border Patrol agents have told Fox News that if a migrant claims they have a fear of persecution, the removal order is changed to a Notice to Appear – meaning they are released into the United States with a future court date.\n\nThey said that migrants are already spreading the word about what to say to get released into the U.S. as the administration has already been increased its use of ER to remove illegal immigrants from Northern Triangle countries.\n\nA senior administration official, in a call with reporters, said there was no plan to use family detention as a way to help deal with the surge. However, the use of ER would allow for the use of detention for single adults. The administration has also stressed that it intends to remove "promptly" those who are allowed in, go through immigration proceedings, and are found not to have a valid asylum case.\n\nThe other pillars of the administration’s plan includes bolstering the capacity of non-governmental organizations to receive migrants after they’ve been processed by Customs and Border Protection (CBP). NGOs often help migrants with travel, housing and other assistance after they are released.\n\nFinally, the administration say it will target and disrupt transnational criminal organizations who facilitate illegal immigration, and also deter illegal migration throughout the Hemisphere. It pointed to new migration agreements with Panama and Costa Rica, as well as "close cooperation with Mexico."\n\n"We are also sending a clear message in the region to counteract misinformation from smugglers, including that the termination of the Title 42 public health Order does not mean that the U.S. border is open," the memo says.\n\n58-MEMBER BIPARTISAN HOUSE PROBLEM SOLVERS CAUCUS BACKS BILL TO EXTEND TITLE 42\n\nMayorkas ends the memo by admitting that the migrant surge will "substantially strain" resources at the border, and instead calls on Congress to pass solutions to fix what the administration has claimed is a "broken" system.\n\n"Despite the efforts of our dedicated DHS workforce and our partners executing this comprehensive plan, a significant increase in migrant encounters will substantially strain our system even further," he says.\n\n"As it has since its first day in office, the Biden-Harris Administration continues to call on Congress to pass legislation that holistically addresses the root causes of migration, strengthens border security, fixes our immigration system, and improves legal pathways," the memo says.\n\nThat legislation was quickly rejected by Republicans early last year due to its inclusion of a mass amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants in the country, combined with a lack of border security measures.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRepublican states have sued the Biden administration in a bid to stop the order being lifted on May 23.

Texas, is the decision last year by President Biden\'s appointees to suspend and ultimately end the policy, which the Trump administration utilized to require 70,000 Latin American migrants to wait outside the U.S. while their asylum requests were reviewed.\n\nFormally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, the Trump administration scaled back the rule at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and Mr. Biden ordered it ended upon taking office. In August 2021, Republican officials in Texas convinced a federal judge to order U.S. border officials to reinstate the program.\n\nIn his ruling, which was later upheld by a federal appeals court, U.S. Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee, said the administration did not adequately justify Remain in Mexico\'s termination and that the policy\'s end led officials to violate a 1996 law that requires the detention of certain migrants. The Biden administration has been implementing the policy since December, albeit in a limited fashion.\n\nThe justices on Tuesday expressed concern about whether Texas should be able to dictate federal policy involving foreign diplomacy and acknowledged that officials can\'t logistically detain all border-crossers. But the justices also questioned whether the administration has the authority to release large groups of migrants instead of detaining them or returning them to Mexico.\n\nThe Justice Department, which asked the Supreme Court to intervene in the case on an expedited basis, argued Tuesday that the executive branch has broad authority to rescind policies enacted by previous administrations, especially those that implicate foreign relations.\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who represented the administration, said the conclusions reached by the lower courts would mean that every U.S. administration has been violating the 1996 migrant detention law since only Trump implemented the Remain in Mexico policy, and not until early 2019.\n\nPrelogar also noted it is logistically impossible to detain all migrants who reach the U.S.-Mexico border since Congress has only allocated funds for fewer than 40,000 immigration detention beds.\n\n"The secretary should finally be allowed to put his policy decision into effect," Prelogar told the justices, referring to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas\' decision to end Remain in Mexico in June 2021.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts told Prelogar he was "sympathetic" toward the position that the government can\'t detain all border-crossers. But he questioned whether releasing large groups of migrants complies with federal law.\n\n"You\'re in a position where the facts have sort of overtaken the law," Roberts said. "But in that situation, what are we supposed to do? It\'s still our job to say what the law is."\n\nA group of migrant families from Central America walk alongside the border wall between the U.S. and Mexico after crossing into the U.S. near the city of Sasabe, Arizona, on Sunday, January 23, 2022. Salwan Georges/The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nTexas\' Solicitor General Judd Stone, however, argued that federal law generally requires U.S. border officials to either detain or return migrants to Mexico. If the U.S. cannot detain migrants because of capacity limits, he argued, it should be returning them to Mexico so they can wait there for the duration of their asylum cases.\n\nJudd acknowledged the government\'s inability to detain all migrants, but said Remain in Mexico\'s enforcement ensures there are "fewer" violations of the 1996 detention law at the center of the case. He said the policy mitigates concerns about detention limits because it deters migrants from crossing the border and in turn, leads to fewer migrants entering U.S. custody.\n\nThe specific questions the Supreme Court considered are whether it should overturn the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals\' conclusion that officials need to enforce Remain in Mexico to comply with the 1996 migrant detention law, and whether the appeals court should have considered the Biden administration\'s second attempt to end the policy. The high court could issue a ruling this summer.\n\nIn its ruling in December upholding the original order against Remain in Mexico\'s termination, the 5th Circuit rejected the argument that a second termination memo by Mayorkas remedied the alleged legal defects of his first termination memo.\n\n"DHS claims the power to implement a massive policy reversal — affecting billions of dollars and countless people — simply by typing out a new Word document and posting it on the internet," the court said in its scathing opinion.\n\nSince reinstating the rule in December, the Biden administration has enrolled 3,012 migrants in the Remain in Mexico program, most of them asylum-seekers from Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela, DHS data show. During that period, U.S. officials along the southern border have processed migrants over 700,000 times.\n\nWhile Mr. Biden has sought to end the Remain in Mexico rules, his administration kept another Trump-era border policy, known as Title 42, that has allowed U.S. officials to swiftly expel migrants without screening them for asylum due to the pandemic. Title 42 is set to expire in late May.\n\nThe Trump administration\'s implementation of Remain in Mexico elicited strong criticism from advocates for migrants, who said the rule left asylum-seekers at the mercy of criminal groups in dangerous Mexican border towns. Human Rights First, a U.S. group, reported hundreds of cases of migrants being kidnapped, assaulted or otherwise harmed after their return to Mexico.\n\nAdvocates also said the program trampled on the due process of asylum-seekers.

The announcement set off a firestorm that has only spread since then as a growing number of moderate Democrats, traditional allies and key chairmen have distanced themselves from the decision.\n\nThe administration has defended the move, and Mayorkas, during a CBS News interview last week, pledged that his department has a plan to respond to an expected increase in the number of migrants at the border.\n\n“The assertion that we do not have plans is an assertion that is not grounded in fact,” Mayorkas said. “We have been planning for months to address increases in migration; those that we already have experienced and those that we might experience upon an end to Title 42.”\n\nBut that’s done little to assuage concerns from congressional Democrats, marking one of the most significant and high-profile breaks between the two sides of Pennsylvania Avenue during Biden’s tenure.\n\nUnderscoring the pressure that the administration is under, Mayorkas, in addition to his committee testimony, will brief a bipartisan group of lawmakers privately on a call on Tuesday, a source confirmed to The Hill.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who has been critical of the administration’s decision, told The Hill that he hadn’t heard from the administration and remained opposed to lifting Title 42.\n\n“I don’t think Title 42 should be done until we have an immigration bill that works or the pandemic, the COVID, is no longer a threat,” Manchin said.\n\nThe politics are complicated for Democrats.\n\nA Politico-Morning Consult poll released earlier this month found that while only 26 percent of Democrats opposed Biden’s Title 42 decision, 52 percent of independents, the voters Democrats could need to win key Senate battles this November, were against the move.\n\nA Gallup poll released this month, but conducted before the CDC announced that it would roll back the border rule, found that 41 percent of Americans worried a “great deal” about “illegal immigration,” while an additional 19 percent worried a “fair amount” about it.\n\nThat breakdown is skewed along party lines.\n\nOnly 41 percent of Democratic respondents, but 56 percent of independents, said they worried about illegal immigration a “great deal” or a “fair amount.”\n\nRepublicans are eager to use the administration’s Title 42 decision against vulnerable Democrats in November as they view immigration as a key part of their midterm message.\n\nRep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), who is facing a progressive primary challenger, told “Fox News Sunday” that the administration’s decision to lift Title 42 has border communities “very concerned.”\n\n“They’re not only public officials but other folks, and none of them said, ‘Yes, go ahead and lift Title 42,’” Cuellar said. “And none of them said, ‘Open up the border.’ They are very concerned because they are on the front lines, and they’re the ones I think we need to listen to.”\n\nThe fight over the border policy has also snagged a separate agreement on $10 billion in coronavirus aid, as Republicans demand a vote to tie Title 42 to the coronavirus assistance.\n\nThe proposal, from Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), would effectively block the administration from rescinding the Trump-era rule as long as the broader coronavirus public health emergency remains in place.\n\nDemocrats could defeat Lankford’s amendment if they were unified — but they aren’t. Five Democratic senators have backed the legislation. Republicans believe they would need only a simple majority, meaning the support of one Democratic senator, for it to get added to the coronavirus bill.\n\nAny move by the administration to try to keep Title 42 in place would likely spark fierce pushback from a coalition of Democratic lawmakers and immigration advocates who long pushed for Biden to get rid of the Trump-era rule, viewing it as inhumane. Those same Democrats have been frustrated by their colleagues who have criticized rescinding it, arguing that they are mirroring GOP talking points.\n\nMembers of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) met at the White House with Biden on Monday.\n\n“I made clear to the President and his team that in order to follow through on a promise to create a just and humane immigration system – Title 42 must end on May 23rd and they should be clear that they do not support legislation to extend the end-date,” CHC Deputy Chair Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.) said in a statement.\n\nThe administration is also facing a legal challenge to its decision to lift the Trump-era rule, raising the prospect that it could get caught up in the courts. A federal judge in Louisiana on Monday issued a temporary restraining order to keep Title 42 in place past May 23.\n\n“I’d like to see a plan from the administration. The courts is separate from what we do here,” said Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), when asked about the court decision.\n\nThe administration is signaling that it’s effectively kicking the question of whether to delay the lifting of the CDC rule, or keep it together, to Congress, which has struggled repeatedly in recent years to reach any consensus on immigration or the border.\n\n“Congress would have to take action in order for the date not to be May 23,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/mayorkasalejandro_092121gn_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:44'}

In total, 317 officers of junior lieutenant rank and above have been killed in a little over two months of fighting, analysis by outlet MediaZona revealed today. Almost a third came from the most senior grades - major or above - including at least two generals and the deputy commander of Russia\'s Black Sea fleet. MediaZona, which is currently blocked in Russia but continues to operate online, compiled its data by looking at public reports of troop deaths from local government officials, newspapers, or families posting on social media. That means the figures will be far lower than the true total because of delays between the troops being killed and their deaths being reported, difficulties in identifying bodies, and deliberate cover-ups by Moscow. In total, MediaZona found 1,744 reports of military deaths in Ukraine - higher than the Kremlin\'s official figure of 1,351 which it has not updated since late March. It found 317 of those deaths were of officers, which accounts for almost a fifth of the total figure. MediaZona believes that is because officer deaths are more-likely to be reported than those of foot-soldiers. The highest-ranked deaths that Russia has acknowledged are of Andrei Sukhovetsky and Vladimir Frolov, who were both Major Generals. Russia has also acknowledged the death of Captain 1st Rank Andrei Paly, the deputy commander of its Black Sea fleet, MediaZona said.

Defense minister Christine Lambrecht is expected announce the delivery of around 50 Gepard anti-aircraft vehicles to Ukraine during a meeting of more than 40 nations that will take place at Ramstein air base today. Germany\'s defence industry has been offering to sell the Gepard vehicles to Ukraine since February, but had been blocked from doing so by Chancellor Olaf Scholz\'s government which led to outcry both inside and outside the country. Scholz, whose SPD party traditionally maintains close ties with Russia, had argued that it would take too long to train Ukrainian soldiers to use the weapons, that Germany had no weapons to sell, and that selling weapons could provoke Putin. But under strong pressure from Germany\'s international allies as well as his own coalition partners, Scholz now appears to have decided to change course. Lambrecht will today deliver a speech at Ramstein air base in which she will say the government has agreed to sign off the delivery of used Gepard anti-aircraft tanks. At the same time, a plan will be submitted to parliament calling for the government to \'continue and, where possible, accelerate the delivery of equipment to Ukraine.\' Equipment will be extended to include \'the delivery [of] heavy weapons and complex systems\', according to a draft of the document shown to AFP. The same document will suggest that Ukrainian soldiers are brought to Germany and other NATO nations so they can be trained how to use the weapons.

The explosions destroyed two powerful Soviet-era radio antennas that were re-broadcasting Russian stations in the region of Transnistria, an unrecognised Moscow-backed sliver of land bordering southwestern Ukraine, on Tuesday. The blasts occurred in the small town of Maiac roughly 12 kilometers (7 miles) west of the border with Ukraine, just days after a Kremlin military chief warned that \'Russian-speakers\' had been \'oppressed\' there. A day earlier, several explosions believed to be caused by rocket-propelled grenades were reported to hit the Ministry of State Security in the city of Tiraspol, the region\'s capital. No one was hurt in the explosions, officials said. On Tuesday, a military unit in the village of Parcani was also targeted. Officials did not offer any details on the incident, but declared a \'red level of terrorist threat\' and promised to impose additional security measures in the region.

Some key events so far: February 24: Russia invades Ukraine from three fronts in the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two. Tens of thousands flee. Russian President Vladimir Putin says he is launching a \'special military operation\' to demilitarise and \'denazify\' Ukraine. Ukraine\'s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy tweets: \'Russia has embarked on a path of evil, but Ukraine is defending itself.\' February 25: Ukrainian forces battle Russian invaders in the north, east and south. Artillery pounds Kyiv and its suburbs and authorities tell residents to prepare Molotov cocktails to defend the capital. February 26: A U.S. defence official says Ukraine\'s forces are putting up \'determined resistance\'. February 28: The first talks between the two sides make no breakthrough. March 1: Russia hits a TV tower in Kyiv and intensifies bombardment of Kharkiv in the northeast and other cities, in what is seen as a shift in tactics as Moscow\'s hopes of a quick charge on the capital fade. A U.S. official says a miles-long Russian armoured column bearing down on Kyiv has not made any advances in the past 24 hours, bogged down by logistical problems.

Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai accused the Kremlin of systematically attacking electricity plants and water pumps to punish the local population. Last week officials in Luhansk said Russian forces had deliberately targeted the supply of food to the eastern region. They swamped the key city of Sievierodonetsk with missiles that wiped out all food depots, as well as markets and shops. The city’s 100,000 population has fallen by 17,000 and they are now reliant on aid supplies. Advertisement\n\nEvidence of Russian soldiers boobytrapping humanitarian aid packages for elderly Ukrainian residents comes as Kremlin insiders told The Financial Times that Putin has given up on peace talks with Ukraine and is intent on seizing as much land as possible.\n\nThe three insiders claimed that the Russian president wanted to grab territory because he felt negotiations had reached a \'dead end\'.\n\nOne insider said: \'There was hope for a deal. Putin was going back and forth. He needs to find a way to come out of this a winner.\'\n\n\'Putin sincerely believes in the nonsense he hears on [Russian] television and he wants to win big,\' another insider added.\n\nA third said he wouldn\'t sign anything after the humiliation caused by the sinking of the Moskva.\n\nA senior member of the Ukrainian delegation, Rustem Umirov, said: \'We continue the negotiation process. Primarily — to save more lives of our people.\'\n\n\'We will use all the political and diplomatic efforts to stop this bloodshed. But there are red lines we will never cross. Ukraine will never give up its people and its territories,\' he told The Times.\n\nMeanwhile, officials in the embattled Ukrainian city of Mariupol say a new \'200-yard mass grave\' has been identified north of the city that could contain hundreds of bodies.\n\nVladimir Putin has given up on peace talks with Ukraine as he wants to seize as much land as he can for Russia, according to Kremlin insiders\n\nEmergency management specialists and volunteers remove the debris of a theatre building destroyed in the course of Ukraine-Russia conflict in the southern port city of Mariupol\n\nSmoke rises above a plant of Azovstal Iron and Steel Works during Ukraine-Russia conflict in the southern port city of Mariupol\n\nMayor Vadym Boychenko said authorities are trying to estimate the number of victims in the grave about six miles north of Mariupol.\n\nThis would be the third after satellite photos released over the last few days have shown what appear to be images of other mass graves.\n\nOn Saturday, chilling satellite photos revealed a second mass grave near Mariupol - as Russian forces continued to pummel the last 2,000 Ukrainian defenders trapped in a steelworks in the city.\n\nThe photos from Maxar Technologies showed the site at a cemetery in the town of Vynohradne.

In total, 317 officers of junior lieutenant rank and above have been killed in a little over two months of fighting, analysis by outlet MediaZona revealed today. Almost a third came from the most senior grades - major or above - including at least two generals and the deputy commander of Russia\'s Black Sea fleet. MediaZona, which is currently blocked in Russia but continues to operate online, compiled its data by looking at public reports of troop deaths from local government officials, newspapers, or families posting on social media. That means the figures will be far lower than the true total because of delays between the troops being killed and their deaths being reported, difficulties in identifying bodies, and deliberate cover-ups by Moscow. In total, MediaZona found 1,744 reports of military deaths in Ukraine - higher than the Kremlin\'s official figure of 1,351 which it has not updated since late March. It found 317 of those deaths were of officers, which accounts for almost a fifth of the total figure. MediaZona believes that is because officer deaths are more-likely to be reported than those of foot-soldiers. The highest-ranked deaths that Russia has acknowledged are of Andrei Sukhovetsky and Vladimir Frolov, who were both Major Generals. Russia has also acknowledged the death of Captain 1st Rank Andrei Paly, the deputy commander of its Black Sea fleet, MediaZona said.

Washington understood how Moscow was behaving. Now there are few rules left.\n\nHe added: \'In those years, there was a channel of communication that both leaders trusted. Now there is no such channel. Nobody is trying to create it.\'\n\nAmerica did set up a \'deconfliction line\' to Moscow in the early days of the Ukraine war, but said the Russia side stopped answering.\n\nLavrov also repeated warnings that shipments of western weapons into Ukraine will be considered legitimate targets by Russia - a day after missiles struck the country\'s train network in an apparent attempt to stop the deliveries.\n\nhe spoke as western nations shift focus in Ukraine from supplying small arms and defensive weapons such as anti-tank and anti-aricraft missiles, to providing heavier arms such as tanks, helicopters, aircraft and long-range artillery.\n\nThe move comes in response to calls from Kyiv to provide its armed forces with the means to recapture territory occupied by Russian forces, in the wake of atrocities carried out by Putin\'s men in places such as Bucha and Irpin.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin travelled to Kyiv on Sunday for a face-to-face meeting with President Zelensky to discuss supplies, before pledging another multi-million dollar shipment.\n\nAustin will also chair a meeting of more than 40 defence ministers at Ramstein air base in Germany today, aimed at securing additional supplies and coordinating efforts between allies to ensure Ukraine has everything it needs.\n\nAhead of the meeting, Austin stated the goal is to ensure Ukraine \'can win\' the war against Russia and \'weaken\' the country to the point where it cannot repeat its invasion a second time.\n\nAhead of the meeting, German media reported that the country will end weeks of dithering and agree to supply heavy arms to Ukraine in the form of 50 Gepard anti-aircraft systems.\n\nUkraine\'s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Monday night that he regards Russia\'s scaremongering as a sign of weakness.\n\nLavrov, speaking to Russian state TV, said tensions between east and west are now at a worse point than during the Cuban missile crisis at the height of the Cold War\n\nRussia considers western arms shipments to Ukraine legitimate targets for attack, Lavrov added, after the US pledged to send heavier weapons to the country this week (file image)\n\nMaria, 13, holds a photograph of her father Yurii Alekseev, 50, a territorial defence member who according to his family was killed by Russian soldiers, as she mourns him during his funeral today\n\nTetyana Boikiv, 52, right, meets and hugs her neighbour Svitlana Pryimachenko, 48, during a funeral service for her husband, Mykola Moroz\n\nGermany will finally authorise tank deliveries to Ukraine Germany will finally authorise the delivery of heavy weapons to Ukraine today after weeks of dithering that has tarnished its reputation on the world stage and led to questions about its commitment to European security. Defense minister Christine Lambrecht is expected announce the delivery of around 50 Gepard anti-aircraft vehicles to Ukraine during a meeting of more than 40 nations that will take place at Ramstein air base today. Germany\'s defence industry has been offering to sell the Gepard vehicles to Ukraine since February, but had been blocked from doing so by Chancellor Olaf Scholz\'s government which led to outcry both inside and outside the country. Scholz, whose SPD party traditionally maintains close ties with Russia, had argued that it would take too long to train Ukrainian soldiers to use the weapons, that Germany had no weapons to sell, and that selling weapons could provoke Putin. But under strong pressure from Germany\'s international allies as well as his own coalition partners, Scholz now appears to have decided to change course. Lambrecht will today deliver a speech at Ramstein air base in which she will say the government has agreed to sign off the delivery of used Gepard anti-aircraft tanks. At the same time, a plan will be submitted to parliament calling for the government to \'continue and, where possible, accelerate the delivery of equipment to Ukraine.\' Equipment will be extended to include \'the delivery [of] heavy weapons and complex systems\', according to a draft of the document shown to AFP. The same document will suggest that Ukrainian soldiers are brought to Germany and other NATO nations so they can be trained how to use the weapons.

Everything we do is calibrated to avoid direct confrontation with Russia.\'\n\nHeappey told Sky News that while NATO had been reinforcing its eastern flank, it was not, as an organisation, providing military aid.\n\n\'The donor community is not NATO,\' Heappey said. \'The donor effort is something that has been brought together by countries that are yes, many of them are from NATO, but others are from beyond ... it is not NATO that is doing the military aid.\'\n\nDuring a visit to Kyiv on Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin promised more military aid for Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. State Department on Monday used an emergency declaration to approve the potential sale of $165 million worth of ammunition to Ukraine.\n\nThe Pentagon said the package could include artillery ammunition for howitzers, tanks and grenade launchers.\n\nMoscow\'s ambassador to Washington told the United States to halt shipments, warning Western weapons were inflaming the conflict.\n\nLavrov said: \'NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy.

The explosions destroyed two powerful Soviet-era radio antennas that were re-broadcasting Russian stations in the region of Transnistria, an unrecognised Moscow-backed sliver of land bordering southwestern Ukraine, on Tuesday. The blasts occurred in the small town of Maiac roughly 12 kilometers (7 miles) west of the border with Ukraine, just days after a Kremlin military chief warned that \'Russian-speakers\' had been \'oppressed\' there. A day earlier, several explosions believed to be caused by rocket-propelled grenades were reported to hit the Ministry of State Security in the city of Tiraspol, the region\'s capital. No one was hurt in the explosions, officials said. On Tuesday, a military unit in the village of Parcani was also targeted. Officials did not offer any details on the incident, but declared a \'red level of terrorist threat\' and promised to impose additional security measures in the region.

Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai accused the Kremlin of systematically attacking electricity plants and water pumps to punish the local population. Last week officials in Luhansk said Russian forces had deliberately targeted the supply of food to the eastern region. They swamped the key city of Sievierodonetsk with missiles that wiped out all food depots, as well as markets and shops. The city’s 100,000 population has fallen by 17,000 and they are now reliant on aid supplies.

Putin was going back and forth. He needs to find a way to come out of this a winner.\'\n\n\'Putin sincerely believes in the nonsense he hears on [Russian] television and he wants to win big,\' another insider added.\n\nA third said he wouldn\'t sign anything after the humiliation caused by the sinking of the Moskva.\n\nA senior member of the Ukrainian delegation, Rustem Umirov, said: \'We continue the negotiation process.

(John Fredricks/The Epoch Times)\n\nUCI Cyber Security Expert, Ex-CIA Analyst Weighs in on Putin, Ukraine War\n\nAs a former senior Soviet analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency as well as ex-advisor to President George W. Bush, then-National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, and other senior government officials, Bryan Cunningham—who is now the Executive Director of the Cybersecurity Policy and Research Institute at the University of California–Irvine—spent years studying Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn a recent interview with The Epoch Times, Cunningham weighed in on Putin’s war with Ukraine now entering its third month.\n\n“I believe we are in more danger now [than during the Cuban Missile Crisis],” he said. “There really is a measurable possibility of a nuclear war.”\n\nAccording to Cunningham, a year ago the likelihood of nuclear war was 1 percent. Now, he says that number is “likely in the double-digits, which is terrifying.”\n\nThis is partly due to Cunningham’s belief that Putin is “less stable” than Khruschev, the former Cold War Soviet leader who once challenged the United States to a missile “shooting match,” and that there is no one in Russia who can “check” Putin’s power or remove him from office.\n\nAdditionally, Cunningham said he believes Putin’s behavior mimics previous dictators, in addition to reports that he is isolating himself from advisors and foreign dignitaries both physically and politically.\n\n“Typically when you’re a dictator for that long, just like Stalin … or Hitler, you stop allowing people near you who will say anything that disagrees with you,” Cunningham said.\n\nAccording to Cunningham, who is also an attorney with the Los Angeles-based firm Zweiback, Fiset & Coleman, Ukraine is an all-or-nothing issue now for Putin.\n\n“I think he’s willing to do whatever it takes to, in his mind, win. I think he feels like this is his legacy now,” Cunningham said.\n\nHis “pessimism” about Putin, Cunningham said, stems from his orders to use tanks and live ammunition to attack the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine in early March, as well as Russia’s military doctrine of using progressively harsher methods including nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons to avoid losing the war, no matter the cost.\n\nA damaged administrative building of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine, in Enerhodar, the Zaporizhzhia region, Ukraine, on March 4, 2022. (Press service of National Nuclear Energy Generating Company Energoatom/Handout via Reuters)\n\nCunningham has two theories for why Putin waged the attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, including that Russia may not have the technological capacity to hack adversaries that we once thought, since it could have simply hacked the plant to shut it down.\n\nMore likely, however, Cunningham said he theorizes that when Putin used “extraordinary” military force on the plant, he risked “vaporizing” his own troops as well as half of Ukraine, a move Cunningham said was Putin’s way of telling the West: “I will do anything I have to to win this war.”\n\nCunningham projects that if Putin’s efforts are successful in Ukraine he will immediately invade other Eastern European states.\n\n“This is about as high-stakes a situation as the West has faced since World War II,” Cunningham said.\n\nTo prevent a third world war with Russia, Cunningham said, the U.S. needs to provide Ukraine with whatever military aid it requests, a move he said that has taken far too long.\n\nAs a cybersecurity expert, Cunningham additionally warned of the increased threat Russia poses to individuals and businesses in the U.S. through cyberattacks.\n\nTo combat this, Cunningham advises companies and individuals to update their cybersecurity software regularly and to proactively use multi-factor authentication when logging into online accounts such as email.\n\nWhen discussing what the media and politicians have “gotten wrong,” about Putin and the conflict, Cunningham said both have incorrectly assumed that the “Russian Oligarchs,” or wealthy businessmen in Putin’s inner circle, would overthrow him.\n\nAccording to Cunningham, there is a misconception these businessmen provide Putin with power and wealth, when they actually rely on him for their wealth by means of alleged corruption, and would, thus, never try to overthrow him.\n\n“I am convinced there is no limit to what Putin will do,” Cunningham said regarding the recent alleged murder-suicide of two Russian oligarchs and their families.\n\nCunningham stated it is far more likely that Putin planned their deaths as a warning to other businessmen in his circle of their possible fates if he is unhappy with them.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2020/10/04/UCI_Irvine_11_JF_092520201-1200x800.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:50'}

Speaking on Twitter early Sunday, he pleaded for an Easter cease-fire, humanitarian escape corridors for civilians and a “special round of negotiations” to exchange military prisoners.

(Carolyn Cole / Los Angeles Times)\n\nEntering a third month, the invasion is spurring the largest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II with more than 5 million fleeing the country and 6.5 internally displaced, according to the U.N. However, Russian troops are failing to make significant territorial gains because of a robust defense, Western officials say.\n\n“Poor Russian morale and limited time to reconstitute, re-equip and reorganize forces from prior offensives are likely hindering Russian combat effectiveness,” the British Defense Ministry’s intelligence assessment said on Sunday.\n\nThe visit by Blinken and Austin follows a stream of European leaders who have already made what has amounted to a pilgrimage of sorts to Kyiv after the withdrawal of Russian forces from the area. Several countries are also reestablishing their diplomatic missions in the capital — the latest being Britain — after having left ahead of the war. The Biden administration will be under pressure to follow suit. U.S. diplomats initially relocated to the western Ukrainian city of Lviv and then pulled out altogether to Poland.\n\nZelensky said he “expected specific things and specific weapons” when world leaders come, adding that he had seen an increase in both the amount and the speed of arms deliveries, especially from Washington.\n\n“They should not come here with empty hands,” he said before the arrival of the U.S. officials, adding that Ukraine should not be used as a prop for “tragic selfies.” “We will return all our land the moment we receive necessary arms.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Kramatorsk, one of the prime targets in Russia’s new phase of the assault, only a few dozen residents attended Easter midnight Mass at the Syvato-Troyitskyy church, a reflection of the tense, fearful atmosphere engulfing the city as the battles edge ever closer.

It’s hard to understand what’s happening, that it could be like this,” he said.\n\nStill, he chose to stay. The situation was still relatively quiet in Kramatorsk, he explained, and as long as the possibility was there to stay, he would.\n\n“The people still here, they’re the children of the church,” he said. “And the father cannot leave them and run away elsewhere.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFive-year-old Dasha eats soup at the World Central Kitchen in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, on Sunday, April 24, 2022.

Normally the food would be blessed by the priest and then taken home to share within the family on Easter, but this year all the baskets are going to the soldiers on the front lines, the residents said.\n\nAnother 50 miles or so to the south, the checkpoint on the eastern edge of Zaporizhzhia was quiet until early afternoon, when a police car, lights flashing, led a convoy of a dozen cars or more, all people escaping Russian occupation in the southern city of Melitopol, which fell to the Russians several weeks ago.\n\nJuliet Korotvkova, 37, her husband and their four children left Russian- occupied territory over the weekend. “We tried to go earlier,” said Juliet, “but they wouldn’t let us leave. But because of Easter, there’s no fighting, and it’s quiet.

I didn’t understand anything they were saying. There were 20 checkpoints. Thank God they didn’t do anything to us.”\n\nZaporizhzhia has become a way station for refugees fleeing Melitopol and Mariupol, with volunteers offering shelter, food and medical care.\n\nSeveral of those arriving said they were taking advantage of the Easter holiday to escape, hoping the fighting would have calmed.\n\nZelensky issued an Easter message to his people.

He added: “Bluster about the use of nuclear, the possible use of nuclear weapons is very dangerous and unhelpful. Nobody wants to see a nuclear war, nobody can win it.”\n\nA key ally of President Vladimir Putin, Nikolai Patrushev, the head of Russia’s security council, on Tuesday said the outcome of “the policies of the west and the Kyiv regime controlled by it would only be the breakup of Ukraine into several states” – an apparent attempt to blame the west for supporting the Zelenskiy government.\n\nAt the western conference, Germany promised it would send approximately 50 refurbished Gepard anti-aircraft missile launchers, leading to praise from the Pentagon chief after weeks of pressure on Berlin to step up its supply of heavy weaponry.\n\nIt was “a major decision” said Austin. “I think those systems will provide real capability to, for Ukraine,” he said, and added he believed the country’s defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, would “continue to look for ways to be relevant and provide the good capability to the Ukrainians”.\n\nBritain pledged a day earlier to send “a small number” of Stormer vehicles which carry Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles – while Canada said at the conference it would send eight armoured vehicles to help Ukraine. But there was no announcement of any commitment to send tanks.\n\nAlthough Nato has repeatedly said it will not enter the war to fight against Russia, western politicians have begun to say their goal is help Ukraine decisively defeat to its neighbour, so that it cannot threaten Kyiv or other neighbours.\n\nSign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am<br><br>\n\nEarlier this week Austin said that Russia should be “weakened to the point where it can’t do things like invade Ukraine” and when asked again about that statement on Tuesday, he offered a similar formulation.\n\n“We would like to make sure again, they don’t have the same type of capability to bully their neighbours that we saw at the outset of this conflict,” he said, highlighting that Russia’s “land forces have been attrited in a very significant way, casualties are pretty substantial, they’ve lost a lot of equipment.”\n\nPrior to the meeting, the US said that the total value of arms donated to Ukraine was $5bn, with the US accounting for $3.7bn. On Monday, the UK said it had already sent £200m worth of arms and had a budget to supply £500m if needed.\n\nThe UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said in a major speech on Tuesday night that the west will never feel safe again and Europe will experience untold further misery if Putin succeeds in Ukraine.\n\n“We cannot be complacent – the fate of Ukraine remains in the balance. And let’s be clear – if Putin succeeds there will be untold further misery across Europe and terrible consequences across the globe. We would never feel safe again. So we must be prepared for the long haul and double down on our support for Ukraine,” she said in the foreign secretary’s annual Mansion House speech.\n\nTruss, still seen as a frontrunner for the Conservative leadership if Boris Johnson resigns, called for a “recasting and rebooting” of the global security architecture “since it has failed Ukraine”, arguing the conflict could be a catalyst for change in the way the free world deters global aggressors.\n\n“I want to live in a world where free nations are assertive and in the ascendant … where freedom and democracy are strengthened through a network of economic and security partnerships … where aggressors are contained and moving toward a better path.

(Andrew Burton/Getty Images)\n\nCensorship No More? The Political Fallout of Elon Musk Buying Twitter\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk has been highly critical of Twitter’s restrictions on speech. With his purchase of the social media platform and his goal of creating an open and transparent environment, there has been some discussion about the impact this could have on U.S. elections moving forward.\n\nElon Musk’s takeover of Twitter is a “huge deal,” according to Hogan Gidley, the former White House spokesman under President Donald Trump.\n\nMembers of the media, celebrities, and elected officials are among the most active users, Gidley told Steve Lance, host of NTD’s Capitol Report. This is significant since the left controls the majority of those people or entities, he added.\n\nAs a result, when information reaches the platform, you’ll witness “in unison, lockstep ideology of one side of an issue.”\n\nAccording to a Pew Research Center study, most tweets come from a small group of highly active Twitter users. About 10 percent of Twitter users in the United States account for almost 80 percent of all tweets. These accounts tweet 138 times every month, compared to the median Twitter user that tweets twice a month.\n\nA separate October 2021 Media Research Center report discovered that the Big Tech firms censored far more Republican members of Congress than their Democratic counterparts: 54-to-1.\n\nThe announcement of the buyout has outraged the left, Gidley said, not because they could be blocked on Twitter, but because Twitter could refuse to censor those they disagree with.\n\nGidley feels that social media platforms influenced the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nDuring the campaign, Twitter took an unprecedented step to block the spread of reports concerning Hunter Biden’s emails due to questions about “the origins of the materials.”\n\n“We couldn’t tweet about it at the campaign. We couldn’t talk about it in our direct messaging. We sure couldn’t do ads on it. Even though we had ads, they wouldn’t run the ads, because they collectively said it was Russian disinformation,” Gidley said.\n\n“I think it’s a serious issue. It has really influenced the outcome of elections. And quite frankly, it is a source of true evil in this country, to rip away the First Amendment freedoms.”\n\nConservatives cheered the news as they anticipate free speech will be prioritized once again, with the social network expected to abandon censorship measures like shadow banning and permanent bans.\n\nIndividuals on the other side of the political spectrum have expressed their concern about the risks to public discourse, despite Musk’s main goal to resuscitate the idea of open communications.\n\n“Let’s be clear. Elon Musk’s effort to buy Twitter is not the only threat to free communications and debate in the United States,” said the Open Markets Institute, a non-profit organization to fighting monopolies and bolstering anti-trust law and competition policy, in a statement.\n\n“The size, scope, and business models of Facebook, Google, and Amazon also pose a wide variety of often extreme threats to American democracy and the basic rights of citizens. That’s why law enforcers and Congress should view this deal as an opportunity to firmly re-establish clear bans on any manipulation of communications by essential platforms, and to eliminate all business models that rely on such manipulation.”\n\nOthers have iterated the view that the public needs to be worried about Twitter in the hands of Musk. Many prominent left-leaning individuals have pledged to leave the platform, including actress Mia Farrow, former Governor Howard Dean, author and former professional wrestler Mick Foley, and New York Times columnist Charles Blow.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) decried Musk’s acquisition, calling it “dangerous for our democracy.”\n\n“One billionaire—whose estimated net worth has gotten about 10 times larger since the start of the pandemic—is about to have the power to decide how millions of people can communicate with each other. It’s dangerous for our democracy to have so much power in so few hands,” the 2020 presidential candidate posted on Twitter.\n\nIt is unclear what critics of Musk’s ownership of Twitter are concerned about. He stated before the announcement that he hopes “that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means.”\n\nMeanwhile, whether policies and practices on the website will change heading into the 2022 electoral cycle or not remains to be seen.\n\nTwitter ignited tremendous controversy shortly before the 2020 presidential election when the website blocked links to the New York Post’s story on Hunter Biden’s laptop. But Twitter’s meddling has been apparent for years, says Jeff Brain, the CEO of CloutHub, an online networking platform for community, social, and political engagement.\n\n“It wasn’t until only 2020,” Brain told The Epoch Times. “I was there in 2018 and I was there in 2016. As we head closer to the election, you see a lot more people who have important voices and you see stories being suppressed.”\n\nCensorship should not be incorporated into the workings of social media platforms because they “are the modern-day talent squares,” Brain noted.\n\n“If you don’t have a voice on these platforms, then you don’t matter,” he added. “These platforms determine the policy in your neighborhood as well as Washington DC, and people need to be able to speak their mind and hear all the facts.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki talks to reporters during the daily news conference in the Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House on March 14, 2022. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nThe White House remarked that the U.S. government might need to look into reforming Section 230. This is a federal rule that says, “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.”\n\nWhile the Biden administration refused to comment on Musk’s deal to buy Twitter, press secretary Jen Psaki shared Biden’s concern about the power of social media.\n\n“Our concerns are not new,” Psaki told reporters Monday. “The president has long talked about his concerns about the power of social media platforms, including Twitter and others, to spread misinformation.”\n\nIn addition, the elephant in the room is Trump’s suspended account. Former president confirmed to multiple news outlets Monday that he would not be returning to Twitter, adding that he would begin participating on Truth Social soon.\n\n“No, I won’t be going back on Twitter,” Trump told CNBC’s Joe Kernen. “I will be on Truth Social within the week. It’s on schedule. We have a lot of people signed up. I like Elon Musk. I like him a lot. He’s an excellent individual. We did a lot for Twitter when I was in the White House. I was disappointed by the way I was treated by Twitter. I won’t be going back on Twitter.”\n\nEmel Akan contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/06/Twitter-logo-e1649313885998-1200x770.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:35'}

Failing to comply with the EU's upcoming law, Breton added, could result in a company being sanctioned ''6% of the revenue and, if they continue, banned from operating in Europe.''\n\nAccording to The New York Times, the act, which ''would begin taking effect by next year, does not order internet platforms to remove specific forms of speech, leaving that to individual countries to define.

Months later, skeptics of COVID-19 vaccine mandates, including prominent doctors, were suspended from Twitter as the company alleged they violated its content policies regarding the virus.\n\nOn Monday and Tuesday, Internet searches for “delete Twitter” surged as it was confirmed Elon Musk would purchase the site.\n\nThe global Google Trends search for the phrase, “delete Twitter,” appeared to spike starting on Monday, while several tech websites published articles about how to delete a Twitter account.\n\nAlso on Monday, Musk said he would be making Twitter’s algorithm open-source and enacting policies to curb what he described as automated spam accounts.\n\nThe SpaceX founder also said he wants “to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features” that includes “authenticating all humans.”\n\nAfter Twitter’s board said Musk would purchase the site, it’s not clear what the next steps are, or if current CEO Parag Agrawal will remain with the company.", 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/1.tagreuters.com2022binary_LYNXNPEI3N0DV-FILEDIMAGE-1200x759.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:48'}

It plunged when he joked about it on air on Saturday Night Live last May. In December, it went up when he said Tesla would accept the coin as payment for merchandise.\n\nThe 'joke' crypto that started as a meme... what is Dogecoin? Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency created as a 'joke' in 2013. Its mascot is a Shiba Inu dog, made popular from the 'doge' meme featuring photos of the canine overlaid with text written in broken English. It can be bought or sold on crypto exchanges like Coinbase or on trading apps like Robinhood and Webull. One Dogecoin is worth 16 cents as of Tuesday morning. It's never been worth more than 64 cents. Creator Billy Markus said last year that he invented the coin as a joke. 'I'm half detached, but it's weird that something I made in a few hours is now part of internet culture,' he said. 'It's amusing to see Elon Musk talk about it. It feels silly, but there's this huge upwelling behind it.'

The power of corporations to dictate policy is greatly enhanced if Twitter depends on advertising money to survive,' he added.\n\n'Maybe even an option to pay in Doge?'\n\nSome Twitter users are worried about the future of the company at the hands of Musk, who is known to use the platform to post inflammatory messages and tease his followers, sometimes with the idea of using Dogecoin legitimately.\n\nIn January, he tweeted: 'Tesla merch buyable with Dogecoin.'\n\nThe stock went up by more than 15 percent that same day, CNBC reports.\n\nLast May, Musk played a financial expert trying to explain crypto on SNL's Weekend Update segment.\n\n'They're a type of digital money but instead of being controlled by a central Government, they're decentralized using blockchain technology,' he explained, letting out a nervous giggle.\n\nIn a bit about how difficult it is to explain, the segment's host repeatedly asked him, 'What is dogecoin?'\n\n'I keep telling you, it's a cryptocurrency you can trade for conventional money.'\n\nDogecoin creator Billy Markus admitted last year that he created the coin as a joke, and that it was 'amusing' to see Elon Musk promoting it\n\n'Oh, so it's a hustle,' Michael Che finally said.\n\n'Yeah, it's a hustle,' Musk replied.\n\nThe stock dived by 22 percent while the show was airing.\n\nDogecoin creator Billy Markus told Bloomberg last year that he invented the coin as a joke.\n\nThe coin was being traded a lot early last year, reaching a high of 64 cents in May, months after amateur investors managed to send shares of video game retailer GameStop soaring.\n\nMarkus cashed in his Dogecoin and abandoned his pet project in 2015.\n\n'I'm half detached, but it's weird that something I made in a few hours is now part of internet culture,' he said. 'It's amusing to see Elon Musk talk about it. It feels silly, but there's this huge upwelling behind it.'\n\nTuesday's slump notwithstanding, Twitter stock is up by more than 9 percent since April 19, when Musk made his offer to buy the company entirely. Tesla shares, meanwhile, fell by about 0.7 percent in the same time.\n\nTwitter stock is up by more than 9 percent since April 19, when Musk made his offer to buy the company entirely\n\nA New York Times reporter says that an unidentified Twitter employee told him they feel like 'throwing up' at the thought of working for Musk\n\nInside Twitter, employees are reportedly dismayed at the realization that Musk is now their boss.\n\n'I feel like im going to throw up..I rly don't wanna work for a company that is owned by Elon Musk,' one employee told a New York Times reporter.\n\nSome raised concerns about whether Musk, a staunch opponent of labor unions who is worth a reported $266 billion, would push the price of shares down as he seeks to take the company private, hitting employees who are partly paid in stock especially hard.\n\nThe unidentified Twitter employee added: 'I don't rly know what I'm supposed to do…oh my god, my phone's been blowing up…We have a meeting about it at 5pm…the CEO is going to address everyone about it\n\n'I hate him, why does he even want this?\n\n'I feel like he's this petulant little boy and that he's doing this to troll…he doesn't know anything about our policies and what we do…his statement about our algo was f****** insane…\n\n'Were just gonna let everyone run amok?…nobody knows.'\n\nEarlier, the 50-year-old tycoon called for his 'worst critics' to remain on the platform because 'that is what free speech means.'\n\nStill, employees are worried about the SpaceX founder's plans for the company.\n\nTwitter CEO Parag Agrawal (left) on Monday spoke to employees to try and reassure them. Co-founder Jack Dorsey (right) holds a board seat, but is expected to give it up in May\n\nMusk is known for using Twitter to post inflammatory messages, much like former President Donald Trump.\n\nParag Agrawal, the CEO, said on Monday that it was up to Musk to decide whether to readmit Trump.\n\nTrump on Monday said he would not be rejoining the site if Musk allowed him to - instead saying he would continue to use his own TRUTH Social.\n\nSome experts are pointing to a tough road ahead for Twitter if Musk, who calls himself a free speech absolutist, gets his way.\n\n'We expect advertisers will be less willing to spend on Twitter if Elon Musk removes content moderation in order to promote free speech,' MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson said.\n\nThe 16-year old company, which has emerged as one of the world's most influential online public squares with about over 200 million users, reported $4.51 billion in ad revenue for 2021, accounting for about 89% of its overall sales.\n\n'The challenge (for Twitter) will be maintaining and building revenue given that the controversial opinions (Musk) hopes to give more of a free rein to are often unpalatable to advertisers,' Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Susannah Streeter said.\n\nTesla tycoon versus Big Tech: How swashbuckling billionaire Elon Musk fought off 'poison pill', lawsuits and hostile board of directors before $44bn Twitter takeover\n\nIt has been one of the most dramatic takeover attempts in history, seeing a swashbuckling billionaire pitted against one of the largest tech giants in the world.\n\nBut Elon Musk's seizing of Twitter has been a months-long pursuit that has seen him send shockwaves through the world of business.\n\nThe Tesla magnate started hoarding shares in the social media firm at the start of the year in an apparent bid to preserve free speech online.\n\nHe quickly rocketed to the top of its shareholders' list, acquiring a huge 9% stake in the tech giant.\n\nBut then he hit choppy waters, accepting a place on the board then rejecting it, getting embroiled in lawsuits and seeing rival companies circle to buy Twitter.\n\nMeanwhile bosses at the social media firm appeared to do all they could to ensure he could not not seize it - even launching a 'poison pill' strategy to sink his chances.\n\nYet Musk brazenly blasted through all the obstacles, punting a $43 billion offer earlier this month and showing how he would finance it.\n\nThe two sides were reportedly working into the early morning on Monday to finalize the 'fast-moving' negotiations.\n\nIt saw Twitter shares in the US soar by four percent as the markets opened to $50.84 a share.\n\nOn Monday, Musk called for his 'worst critics' to remain on the platform because 'that is what free speech means'.\n\nHere, DailyMail.com looks at the rollercoaster journey he has been on over the last few months as he seizes his prize.\n\n\n\nThe Tesla magnate started hoarding shares in the social media firm at the start of the year in an apparent bid to preserve free speech online\n\nJanuary 31: Musk hoards Twitter shares and buys them 'almost daily'\n\nMusk started buying Twitter stock on January 31 and continued to buy shares during every trading session through April 1, according to an SEC filing.\n\nJust days earlier, he told his 80 million followers on the site he was ' giving serious thought ' to creating his own social media platform.\n\nA user asked him: 'Would you consider building a new social media platform, @elonmusk?\n\n'One that would consist an open source algorithm, one where free speech and adhering to free speech is given top priority, one where propaganda is very minimal. I think that kind of a platform is needed.'\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO replied through his official account: 'Am giving serious thought to this.'\n\nThe billionaire businessman, 50, appeared to be suggesting he was sick of Twitter over the right to freedom of speech.\n\nApril 4: Musk says he bought 9.2 percent stake in firm a month earlier\n\nMusk revealed he had purchased a 9.2 percent stake in the social media giant on March 14.\n\nHe tweeted 'oh hi lol' after the news sent shockwaves through the business world and across social media. He added: 'Do you want an edit button?'\n\nApril 5: He joins Twitter's board of directors - sees share price rocket\n\nTwitter said the tech tycoon was joining the company's board of directors, causing the social media platform's shares to rise over 7 per cent in premarket trading.\n\nIt led to speculation he would try to address what he called the platform's 'failure to adhere to free speech principles' and 'fundamentally undermine democracy'.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Musk would have served on the board until the company's 2024 annual shareholders meeting.\n\nAs long as he remains a director, the agreement said, he could not won more than 14.9 percent of the company's stock.\n\nIt meant he would not have been able to take over the company until well after his term on the board was over.\n\nThe firm said: 'Twitter is committed to impartiality in the development and enforcement of its policies and rules.\n\n'Our policy decisions are not determined by the Board or shareholders, and we have no plans to reverse any policy decisions.'\n\n'As always our Board plays an important advisory and feedback role across the entirety of our service.\n\n'Our day to day operations and decisions are made by Twitter management and employees.'\n\nApril 8: Asset managers take over Musk as largest shareholders\n\nAsset manager Vanguard Group increased its stake to overtake Musk as the largest shareholder.\n\nVanguard owned 10.3 percent of Twitter, while the Tesla tycoon owned 9.1 per cent, making him the largest individual shareholder.\n\nVanguard, led by CEO Tim Buckley, increased its stake in the company at some point during the first quarter, according to SEC filings made on April 8.\n\nIt previously reported owning 67.2million shares of Twitter or about 8.4 per cent of the company as of the end of December, according to FactSet.\n\nOther owners of large quantities of Twitter stock included Morgan Stanley, Fidelity and Black Rock.\n\nVanguard, led by CEO Tim Buckley, increased its stake in the company at some point during the first quarter, according to SEC filings made on April 8\n\nApril 9: Musk rejects the offer to join Twitter's board of directors\n\nMusk rejected an offer to join Twitter's board after disclosing his stake in the company.\n\nAnalysts said the move signaled his intention to take over the company as a board seat would have limited his stake to just under 15 per cent.\n\nParag Agrawal said the board would still 'remain open' to Musk's input, but warned: 'There will be distractions ahead but our goals and priorities remain unchanged.'\n\nHe said: 'The board and I had many discussions about Elon joining the board, and with Elon directly. We were excited to collaborate and clear about the risks.\n\n'We also believed that having Elon as a fiduciary of the company where he, like all board members, has to act in the best interests of the company and all our shareholders, was the best path forward. The board offered him a seat.'\n\nAgrawal continued: 'We announced on Tuesday that Elon would be appointed to the board contingent on a background check and formal acceptance.\n\n'Elon's appointment to the board was to become officially effective 4/9, but Elon shared that same morning that he will no longer be joining the board.'\n\nParag Agrawal said the board would still 'remain open' to Musk's input, but warned: 'There will be distractions ahead but our goals and priorities remain unchanged'\n\nApril 12: Twitter shareholder Marc Bain Rasella files suit against Musk\n\nMarc Bain Rasella filed a lawsuit against Musk for alleged securities fraud at a Manhattan federal court, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nThe suit claimed the billionaire was required to disclose his holdings to the SEC by March 24, but the delay kept Twitter's share price down allowing Musk to buy more.\n\nMusk was accused of violating a regulatory deadline to reveal he had accumulated a stake of at least five per cent.\n\nInstead, according to the complaint, Musk did not disclose his position in Twitter until he had almost doubled his stake to more than nine per cent.\n\nThat strategy, the lawsuit alleges, hurt less wealthy investors who sold shares in the company in the nearly two weeks before Musk acknowledged holding a major stake.\n\nApril 14: The Tesla tycoon offers to buy Twitter for $43 BILLION\n\nMusk offered to buy Twitter for $43billion, a regulatory filing showed, as he moved to seize the social media giant.\n\nMusk's offer price of $54.20 per share represented a 38 per cent premium to the closing price of Twitter's stock on April 1.\n\nThis was the last trading day before the Tesla CEO's over nine per cent investment in the company was publicly announced.\n\nIt even appeared to reference marijuana - also known as 420 - a common reference used by Musk on Twitter.\n\nTwitter said in a regulatory filing Musk provided a letter containing a proposal to buy the remaining shares of Twitter he did not already own.\n\nApril 15: Twitter launches 'poison pill' strategy to stop Musk buyout\n\nTwitter's board announced a dramatic poison pill plan to prevent Musk from increasing his stake in the company.\n\nAlso known as a shareholder rights provision, the plan would trigger a dilution of shares if any shareholder builds up a 15 per cent stake without the board's approval.\n\nThe plan did not prevent Twitter from accepting Musk's offer or entering negotiations with him or other potential buyers.\n\nBut it did stop the billionaire from putting pressure on the board by buying up ever more shares on the open market.\n\nMusk hit back with a laughing emoji to a version of the classic 'Distracted Boyfriend' meme mocking Twitter's board.\n\nThe imaged depicted 'Twitter's board' looking wistfully at the option to 'keep that easy gig that gives me shares' as 'Twitter investors' look on with disgust.\n\nTwitter's board is led by chairman Bret Taylor, who is also the co-CEO of business software giant Salesforce\n\nApril 16: Musk tweets Love Me Tender in tease of hostile takeover\n\nMusk tweeted 'Love Me Tender' as he again teased at the possibility of a hostile takeover of Twitter.\n\nThe billionaire posted the Elvis Presley lyrics in a potential bid to lure shareholders with a tender offer that could see him seize control.\n\nA tender offer would see him bypass the board and go to shareholders with his offer of $54.20 a share - but he would need to show how he would finance his bid.\n\nHe also appeared to suggest he would strip board members of their salaries, saying they would get '$0 if my bid succeeds'.\n\nApril 18: Jack Dorsey slams the Twitter board for 'plots and coups'\n\nJack Dorsey slammed the board of Twitter as he weighed into the toxic fight over Elon Musk's attempted hostile takeover for the first time.\n\nThe former CEO, who is still a member of the board himself, blasted the 'plots and coups' that were 'consistently the dysfunction of the company'.\n\nIn a series of bombshell tweets and replies, he endorsed one posting saying that 'a bad board will kill a company every time'.\n\nReplying to one post, he said: 'When I was fired in 2008 and made chair, the board took most of my shares away from me.\n\n'I also gave 1 per cent of the company back to the employee pool in 2015. So, ended up with very little of company.'\n\nHe also replied to one comment mentioning 'plots and coups' in the Twitter board saying: 'it's consistently been the dysfunction of the company'.\n\nEarlier in the thread, he replied to a post quoting a 'Silicon Valley proverb' by venture capitalist Fred Destin.\n\nIt said: 'Good boards don't create good companies, but a bad board will kill a company every time.' Dorsey said: 'Big facts.'\n\nFormer CEO Dorsey slammed Twitter's board of directors on as he replied to a series of unfriendly tweets\n\nApril 21: SpaceX boss unveils his $46.5billion financing package\n\nElon Musk unveiled his $46.5billion financing package to fund his takeover of Twitter - using Tesla as collateral.\n\nThe world's richest man filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission outlining how he would seize the social media giant.\n\nHe committed $21billion in equity, $13billion from Morgan Stanley in debt facilities and another $12.5billion from the bank and others in margin loans.\n\nBut 'a portion' of his shares in Tesla have been put forward as collateral, which analysts feared could have a huge impact on the firm.\n\nThe 50-year-old billionaire also revealed he was weighing up launching a tender offer for Twitter after the company ignored his acquisition offer.\n\nHe said he was exploring getting stocks directly from shareholders but admitted he 'has not determined whether to do so at this time'.\n\nMusk filed the document with the SEC showing how he planned to take over Twitter for about $46.5billion.\n\nHe secured a debt commitment letter from Morgan Stanley Senior Funding to the tune of $13billion in financing.\n\nThis was made up of a loan of $6.5billion, a senior secured revolving facility for $500million, a bridge loan of up to $3billion and an unsecured bridge loan for up to $3billion.\n\nHe also got a margin loan commitment letter from Morgan Stanley for $12.5 billion in margin loans. And Musk also got $21billion through equity financing.\n\nBut he has used 'a portion' of his shares in Tesla as collateral in the high-stakes move, which analysts warned could have huge ramifications for the company.\n\nApril 22: Musk posts 'boner' killer picture of Bill Gates on Twitter\n\nMusk dissed Bill Gates' gut on Twitter, posting a photo of the Microsoft mogul next to Apple's controversial pregnant man emoji 'in case you need to lose a boner.'\n\nHe posted a follow-up image in response to the Friday post of six hooded figured captioned 'shadow ban council reviewing Tweet'.\n\nThe joke could further infuriate woke Twitter staffers angered by Musk's ongoing bid to buy the firm after saying he would support free speech.\n\nThat is because the pregnant man emoji is aimed at being inclusive to transgender people - with Musk frequently taking aim at what he sees as woke overreach.\n\nApril 25: Musk finalizes deal to buy Twitter\n\nMusk was closing in on seizing Twitter as talks between the Tesla magnate and the tech giant entered their final stages, reports say.\n\nThe tycoon's representatives were said to be hammering out terms including a timeline and fees if an agreement was signed and then fell apart.\n\nThe two sides were reportedly working into the early morning to finalize the 'fluid and fast-moving' negotiations.\n\nTwitter shares soared by four percent as the markets opened to $50.84 a share amid reports it would be seized by Musk.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Twitter announced it had 'entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by an entity wholly owned by Elon Musk, for $54.20 per share in cash in a transaction valued at approximately $44 billion. Upon completion of the transaction, Twitter will become a privately held company.'", 'image': 'https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/26/14/57069119-0-image-a-49_1650980561815.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:46'}

This afternoon, the board accepted Musk\'s offer to buy the company for $54.20 a share.\n\nLong a Twitter power user/troll/loudmouth, Musk bought a 9.2 percent stake in the company last month, becoming the largest shareholder, before deciding he\'d rather have the whole thing.\n\nCue hysteria! Musk haters have taken to the site to declare that Donald Trump will now probably win the 2024 election, that Musk\'s bid is really about white power, that Section 230 must be reformed, and that, yes, Musk\'s new policies will be lethal. (Perhaps the death toll will be even larger than net neutrality\'s!)\n\nSo, for users of the platform, what\'s likely to change?\n\nMusk has panned the site\'s existing content moderation policies, saying they are too restrictive and encroach on people\'s ability to speak freely without being censored. Some liberalization of these policies and the re-platforming of controversial figures like former President Donald Trump—who was banned in the wake of the January 6 riot for inciting violence among his fans—seems likely, though unpopular with droves of users.\n\nAt the mid-April TED conference in Vancouver, Musk talked about his interest in making Twitter\'s algorithm open-source. The Diff\'s Byrne Hobart took this a step further, outlining how "Twitter should monetize a protocol rather than run an app," and explaining the tension between Twitter as a consumer product and as "a way for individual users to update a universal shared database, which can then be filtered based on who\'s interested in what." Hobart claims that it\'s possible that Twitter has been "radically miss-monetized," and that Musk could potentially realign its priorities. However, little of the online discourse has focused on the technical possibilities.\n\nThe new Twitter owner has, through coy tweets, hinted that his new policies will not be applied arbitrarily and that consistent application will mean some number of right-wing users currently cheering his new ownership will surely be disappointed:\n\nI hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 25, 2022\n\nA social media platform\'s policies are good if the most extreme 10% on left and right are equally unhappy — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 19, 2022\n\nElsewhere, Musk has said that Twitter is a "town square" or "public square," and that banning people from using the platform effectively prevents them from participating in the important discussions of the day.\n\nThough people who care about fostering a culture of free speech may agree with the tenor of Musk\'s comments, the analogy is a terrible one. For most of America, the public square is the school board meeting and the town council meeting. There are also numerous other privates spaces for civic engagement: the church pulpit and the post-sermon fray it inspires; neighborhood listservs and the cesspool that is NextDoor; or maybe it\'s Facebook, in-person conversations, and email lists. For many millions of Americans, Twitter is not integral to hashing out values, concerns, and disagreements. Think of the implications if we expected the government to treat such companies—which have their own terms of service and standards that they are free to decide and we are free to consent to—as something akin to public utilities.\n\nIf anything, the new owner of a social media company should convey an inflated sense of the platform\'s worth! But Musk has at times, despite his forceful defense of free speech culture on the internet, repeated confused talking points that indicate scattered thinking while simultaneously failing to fully flesh out what day-to-day operations will look like. For example, a lot of content moderation involves the unsexy—and not very ideological—challenge of keeping spam under control. And, as Mike Masnick points out at Techdirt, Musk doesn\'t seem to have a particularly robust understanding of "hate speech" and how much of what we call hate speech is, in fact, protected by the First Amendment.\n\nA lot remains to be seen about how Twitter will change and what Musk will bring to the table. Optimism, with some reservations about Musk\'s ability to execute, seems warranted.

Jody Hice (R-Ga.), in all caps. A Twitter survey by Sen. Ted Cruz asked if Musk’s purchase was a good thing, with the only options to answer being “yes” or “no, I hate free speech.” His fellow Texan, Rep. John Carter, signaled his approval with no words at all; three clapping-hands emojis were sufficient.\n\nA pot-smoking, meme-posting evangelist for electric vehicles may be an unlikely hero for conservatives. But the Tesla chief executive’s amorphous vow to restore free speech to the social media platform has resonated among Republicans, who see themselves — starting with their de facto leader, former President Trump — as unfairly targeted by Twitter’s content moderation efforts.\n\nConservatives said their euphoric outpouring was bigger than the possible return of @RealDonaldTrump and changes to Twitter’s ownership. Rather, they see Musk’s takeover as a symbolic, and cathartic, blow against Big Tech, which the right has increasingly viewed with antipathy.\n\n“There’s a gut reaction from a lot of people, going, ‘You know what, it’s about time they get their comeuppance,’ ” said Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.). “It finally feels like someone is standing up for a principle that has been going in an opposite direction lately: less free speech, less ability to express yourself — if you are a conservative.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk centered his bid for Twitter on the premise that the social media company, which he considers a “digital town square,” is too restrictive in clamping down on expression.\n\n“I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” Musk tweeted Monday morning.\n\nMusk’s own politics are idiosyncratic. He’s the foremost face of clean vehicles who called for immediately increasing oil and gas production after the Ukraine-Russia war spiked energy prices. He fled California for Texas because of high taxes but declined to weigh in on Texas’ restrictive abortion law, saying he preferred to “stay out of politics.” He has described himself as politically independent and registered to vote in California with no party preference.\n\nFor conservatives, Musk’s crusade against content restrictions has struck a chord. Roughly half of Republicans feel they cannot express themselves freely on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, according to a Morning Consult poll conducted this month, far exceeding the percentage of Democrats and independents who felt similarly.\n\nPolitics Who did Twitter ban during the Trump era, and why? Could banned Trump allies return to Twitter under Elon Musk? A look at the former president’s backers who were kicked off the social media platform.\n\n“Twitter is a platform that I and many others believe has been more aggressive in blocking Republicans and conservatives than they have toward people on the left,” said Rep. Austin Scott (R-Ga.). “I’m hoping and expecting he will undo that.”\n\nScott is not an avid Twitter user; he does not even have the app on his phone. But he did tweet a congratulatory message to Musk, adding a plea to “restore free speech and bring back President Trump!”\n\nTrump was permanently kicked off the platform on Jan. 8, 2021 — two days after a group of his supporters overran the U.S. Capitol in hopes of blocking the certification of Joe Biden’s win. Twitter imposed the ban “due to the risk of further incitement of violence.”\n\nSo far, Musk has not indicated how he’d handle the former president’s account. Trump, meanwhile, has shown no interest in rejoining the platform that helped power his political rise and gave real-time narration of his presidency.\n\n“I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,” Trump told Fox News, referring to his fledgling social media network. “I hope Elon buys Twitter, because he’ll make improvements to it, and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth.”\n\nRepublicans see Trump as just one example of Twitter’s bias. A number of high-profile conservatives have been suspended or blocked from the platform, including the account of the Babylon Bee, a satirical news website that was suspended for a tweet naming Assistant Health Secretary Rachel Levine, who is transgender, “Man of the Year.”\n\nThe account was locked as a violation of Twitter’s ban on hate speech. Seth Dillon, CEO of Babylon Bee, refused to remove the tweet, asserting that “truth is not hate speech.”\n\n“It’s completely broken,” said Harmeet Dhillon, a conservative lawyer who has sued Twitter multiple times on behalf of clients who were banned. “The company can try to affect elections, try to ban politicians from speaking ... use algorithms, enable false accounts to constantly affect what people see.”\n\nThe extent to which conservatives face bias on the platform has been fiercely examined and debated. A study this month by researchers at MIT and Yale found that Republican users tend to be suspended more often than Democrats but that conservatives are more likely to share misinformation that would provoke such suspensions.\n\nSo far, Musk has offered little explanation as to how his free speech values would play out in practice. He said on Monday that his goals include “enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots and authenticating all humans.”\n\nBut such efforts would require some attempt at regulating content, especially by verifying users. A social media network without any moderation at all could swamp the platform with all sorts of unsavory or offensive material, such as pornography or terrorist content, as well as the online abuse and harassment that are already common occurrences.\n\n“If you don’t have content moderation, you actually have less free speech. The people who are the loudest are the bullies and harassers that drive people away,” said Katie Harbath, a former Republican operative who has worked as public policy director for Facebook.\n\nDhillon, the conservative attorney based in California, said she is not hoping for Musk to completely abandon regulation.\n\n“There’s plenty of room for them to do old-school content moderation of the kind they originally did,” she said, citing as an example prohibitions on making death threats.\n\nWith Musk’s plans still unknown, Harbath, who now runs a tech policy strategy firm, said the celebratory conservatives “are making a hell of a lot of assumptions of what Elon means by all this stuff. I don’t think they should assume he is completely on their side.”\n\nRepublicans’ triumphant tone on Twitter starkly contrasted with the more muted reaction from liberal politicians. Far fewer Democratic members of Congress weighed in on Twitter, although those who did were markedly unenthused.\n\n“This deal is dangerous for our democracy. Billionaires like Elon Musk play by a different set of rules than everyone else, accumulating power for their own gain. We need a wealth tax and strong rules to hold Big Tech accountable,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), with whom Musk has sparred on Twitter.\n\nHuizenga, the Michigan congressman, expected that liberals would be none too pleased with Musk’s purchase. Indeed, some vowed to leave the site entirely — much to Huizenga’s amusement.\n\n“It seems like ‘I’m quitting Twitter’ has become the ‘I’m moving to Canada if Trump wins,’ ” he said, adding, “It’s kind of fun sitting back, watching them completely lose their collective minds.”', 'image': 'https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ac14b68/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2941x1544+0+208/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F86%2F23%2Ff46440b54bd7a6509db9c67caab5%2Fphilanthropy-billionaries-tax-28080.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:57'}

(Patrick Pleul/Pool/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nElon Musk Reveals More Details of His Plans for Twitter After Buyout\n\nElon Musk revealed more details of what he has in mind for changes at Twitter after it was confirmed that the company had accepted his buyout offer, with the tech mogul’s plans including new features and ways to enhance trust in the platform.\n\nTwitter’s board of directors said on April 25 that it had approved Musk’s offer to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share in cash, in a deal worth around $44 billion.\n\nThe buyout represents a 38 percent premium over Twitter’s closing stock price on April 1, with Parag Agrawal, CEO of Twitter, saying in a statement that he believes the deal “is the best path forward for Twitter’s stockholders.”\n\n‘Bedrock of a Functioning Democracy’\n\nIn a statement, Musk provided some details about what kind of changes he has in mind for the social media platform, whose commitment to free speech he has repeatedly called into question.\n\n“Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,” Musk said. This dovetails with his earlier statements that Twitter functions as a “de facto town square” where important conversations should be able to take place with as few constraints as possible.\n\nMusk said Monday that Twitter has “tremendous potential” and that he wants to work with the company and its users to “unlock” and make the platform “better than ever.”\n\nHe said he plans on “enhancing” Twitter with new features, which he did not provide further details on. Musk earlier created a Twitter poll asking users if they want an edit button on the platform, suggesting that this could be one of the changes he is seeking to effect.\n\nMusk also said on Monday he wants to make the platform’s algorithms “open source to increase trust,” while “defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.”\n\nThis, too, reinforces his earlier remarks that his objective in seeking to buy Twitter and turn it into a private company was to transform it into a bastion of free speech by opening up its algorithm to public scrutiny and by making its moderation policies more transparent.\n\n‘Black Box Algorithm’\n\nA self-described “free speech absolutist,” Musk told the audience at a recent TED event in Vancouver, Canada, that Twitter should permit unconstrained expression, though it should do so in line with the law.\n\n“In my view, Twitter should match the laws of the country,” Musk said, acknowledging reasonable legal caps on free speech like direct incitement to violence or shouting “fire” in a crowded theater.\n\n“But going beyond that and having it be unclear who’s making what changes to where, having tweets mysteriously be promoted and demoted with no insight into what’s going on, having a black box algorithm promote some things and not other things, I think this can be quite dangerous,” Musk said.\n\n“My strong, intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization,” he added.\n\nErr on Side of Free Speech\n\nMusk also expressed reluctance about permanent bans of users from Twitter, preferring instead temporary “time-outs.”\n\n“I’m not saying that I have all the answers here,” Musk said at the TED talk. But I do think that we want to be just very reluctant to delete things, just be very cautious with permanent bans. Timeouts I think are better than permanent bans.”\n\nIn terms of calibrating Twitter’s moderation policies, Musk said he’d want to err on the side of free speech.\n\n“If in doubt, let the speech, let it exist,” Musk said. “If it’s a grey area, I would say let the tweet exist. But obviously in a case where there’s perhaps a lot of controversy, that you would not want to necessarily promote that tweet.”\n\n“A good sign as to whether there’s free speech is, is someone you don’t like allowed to say something you don’t like,” Musk said. “And if that is the case, then we have free speech.”\n\n‘We Are Concerned’\n\nMusk has repeatedly questioned Twitter’s commitment to free speech, after accusations that the platform suppressed some minority and politically conservative viewpoints, claims Twitter has denied.\n\nMany free speech advocates have hailed Musk’s takeover bid, while those opposed have expressed fear that fewer constraints on expression on Twitter will make it too easy to abuse the platform’s reach and power by, for example, spreading disinformation.\n\nIn a series of tweets reacting to Musk’s takeover moves, Amnesty International expressed concern about the erosion of policies meant to protect users.\n\n“We are concerned with any steps that Twitter might take to erode enforcement of the policies and mechanisms designed to protect users,” Amnesty International wrote.\n\n“The last thing we need is a Twitter that wilfully turns a blind eye to violent and abusive speech against users,” the group said.\n\nAs it was confirmed Musk would purchase Twitter, the Tesla founder urged his “worst critics” to stay on the platform.\n\n“I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” he wrote in a Twitter post.\n\nDan Ives, an analyst at investment firm Wedbush Securities, told the BBC that he expects most users will take a “wait-and-see approach” on whether they stay or leave the platform, based on the changes that take place.\n\n“Now it’s about courting new users and stopping defectors from the platform,” Ives told the outlet.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/19/article-image-cal-thomas-3-1200x804.jpeg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:50'}

It said an appeal was contingent on whether the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) thought the mandate "remains necessary for public health." On Wednesday evening, the CDC confirmed that, in its view, "an order requiring masking in the indoor transportation corridor remains necessary for the public health."\n\nYet while the Justice Department is now asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit to review U.S. District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle\'s ruling against the mask mandate, it did not seek a stay that would allow the CDC to reinstate this supposedly necessary edict while the case is pending. The mandate\'s supporters say the appeal is aimed not at restoring the mask requirement so much as upholding the CDC\'s lawful public health authority. The contours of that authority remain nebulous, however, and the version promoted by the agency\'s defenders is alarmingly broad.\n\n"Basically, [the Biden administration] is giving up on the mask mandate," Georgetown University law professor Lawrence Gostin told The New York Times on Friday. "The administration\'s goal is a legal principle, which is to ensure that the CDC has strong public health powers to fight COVID and to fight future pandemics. And it appears much less important to them to quickly reinstate the mask mandate."\n\nGostin, who according to the Times "advised the White House on the case," elaborates on that "legal principle" in a Times opinion piece published today. "Should the federal government have the power to address broad public health emergencies?" Gostin and civil rights lawyer Duncan Hosie write. As they see it, Mizelle "effectively answered no."\n\nRegardless of what you think about the wisdom of the CDC\'s mask mandate, Gostin and Hosie say, "you should be alarmed by her decision," because it "could prevent the federal government from effectively and nimbly responding to future pandemics." Worse, "her approach and rationale could undermine the federal government\'s authority to confront other big problems, from occupational health and safety to climate change."\n\nGostin and Hosie see the mask mandate as a straightforward example of administrative law, which allows executive agencies to "fill in the details" based on a general charge from Congress. "Up until very recently, the statutory authority of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to try to curb the interstate or international transmission of an infectious, deadly disease was not in doubt," they write. "The Public Health Service Act authorizes the C.D.C. to \'make and enforce such regulations\' that in its \'judgment are necessary to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable diseases.\'"\n\nGostin and Hosie are quoting from the first sentence of 42 USC 264(a), the provision that the CDC cited as the legal basis for requiring that air travelers, public transit users, and taxi or ride-share passengers wear face masks. But as the Supreme Court noted when it blocked the CDC\'s eviction moratorium, reading that opening sentence as a general grant of power "would give the CDC a breathtaking amount of authority."\n\nAll sorts of restrictions and requirements—including nationwide lockdowns, a general vaccine mandate, and highly invasive limits on personal behavior—could be justified in the name of disease control. As the Court observed, "it is hard to see what measures this interpretation would place outside the CDC\'s reach, and the Government has identified no limit…beyond the requirement that the CDC deem a measure \'necessary.\'" The Court found it highly implausible that such powers were lurking in a rarely used statutory provision, only to be discovered by the CDC 76 years after the law was enacted.\n\nIt is doubtful that the delegation of such vast authority to the CDC would be consistent with the separation of powers, which limits the executive branch\'s role in lawmaking, or with federalism, since protecting public health is primarily a state and local function. That broad interpretation of Section 264(a) also seems inconsistent with the list of specific disease control measures that follows the opening sentence: "inspection, fumigation, disinfection, sanitation, pest extermination, [and] destruction of animals or articles found to be so infected or contaminated as to be sources of dangerous infection to human beings."\n\nIf the CDC had plenary power to "prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable diseases," there would be no need to mention specific policies. And while Section 264(a) also refers to "other measures" deemed "necessary," the Supreme Court concluded that the list of specific examples "informs the grant of authority by illustrating the kinds of measures that could be necessary."\n\nThe question for Mizelle, then, was whether the CDC\'s mask mandate was similar to any of the listed measures. The CDC argued that the policy fell under the heading of "sanitation." In her 59-page ruling, Mizelle offered several reasons for rejecting that interpretation.\n\nMizelle said common usage when Congress passed the Public Health Service Act in 1944 suggested that "sanitation" should be read narrowly, encompassing measures that involve cleaning something rather than keeping something clean. She noted that Section 264(a) seems "limited to property," while other provisions of the Public Health Service Act deal with isolation and quarantine of individuals. If "sanitation" were read as broadly as the CDC prefers, she said, it would subsume other measures on the list, again raising the question of why Congress bothered to mention them.\n\nMizelle also was concerned that the CDC\'s understanding of "sanitation" would raise the same basic issue as a broad reading of the provision\'s first sentence or of "other measures." According to one definition cited by the CDC, she noted, sanitation means the "applying of measures for preserving and promoting public health," which would give the agency carte blanche to impose any policy it thought would help reduce the spread of disease—the same interpretation that the Supreme Court rejected.\n\nThe history of Section 264(a)\'s application, Mizelle argued, is another reason to doubt the CDC\'s current understanding of the law. Prior to 2020, she said, "perhaps the most notable use of this statute" was "a decision to ban small turtles due to a risk of salmonella."\n\nGostin and Hosie describe Mizelle\'s reading of "sanitation" as "strained and tendentious," and even critics of the mask mandate have questioned her distinction between two senses of the word. While Mizelle\'s analysis is "very thorough," George Mason law professor Ilya Somin said in a Volokh Conspiracy post last week, "I remain skeptical." He added:\n\nThe broader definition of "sanitation" strikes me as more intuitive and more in accordance with ordinary usage than the narrow one. Among other things, the narrow definition would lead to some counterintuitive results. For example, if the CDC enacted a regulation barring defecation on the floor of a plane or train, that would not qualify as "sanitation" under Judge Mizelle\'s approach because it does not clean anything, but merely "keep[s] something clean" (in this case, the floor). Yet, I think, most ordinary people—both today and in 1944—would agree that a ban on defecating on the floor qualifies as a "sanitation" policy. And, as Judge Mizelle notes, courts are generally required to follow the ordinary meaning of words in a federal statute, unless there is some strong evidence to the contrary.\n\nSomin thought Mizelle\'s "best argument against the broad definition of \'sanitation\'" was the concern that it would violate "the canon against redundancy," since "it does seem like the broad definition of \'sanitation\' might make \'disinfection,\' \'destruction,\' and \'fumigation\' redundant." But he suggested that problem could be avoided by defining "sanitation" broadly enough to encompass the mask mandate yet narrowly enough to avoid the overlap:\n\n"Sanitation" could be interpreted to refer to ordinary cleaning measures—both those that "remove refuse and debris" and those that help prevent it from arising in the first place (as with the rule against defecation!). By contrast, terms like "fumigation" and "disinfection" might refer to the use of chemical agents and other more sophisticated techniques to forestall (in the case of "fumigation") or eliminate (in the case of "disinfection") infection. "Destruction" also has a distinct meaning, of course, as even a broad definition of the other terms doesn\'t necessarily allow complete destruction of possibly dangerous articles.\n\nSuch an approach probably would not satisfy Gostin and Hosie, who seem intent on reading Section 264(a) as giving the CDC a general disease control authority. "The C.D.C. claims no power that Congress [has] not explicitly given it," they write. In their view, it makes sense that "an agency tasked with slowing the interstate spread of a highly infectious virus would regulate interstate travel" (although the CDC\'s mask mandate also applied to intrastate travel such as bus, subway, and Uber rides). Gostin and Hosie, unlike the Supreme Court, also think that mission is clearly broad enough to encompass the CDC\'s eviction moratorium (which likewise covered intrastate conduct), because that policy "was intended to prevent mass evictions and keep people out of congregate settings where Covid spreads most easily."\n\nIn addition to concluding that the CDC had exceeded its authority under Section 264(a), Mizelle said the agency had violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by failing to properly justify its decision to dispense with the usual public notice and comment procedures for new regulations. She also deemed the mask mandate "arbitrary and capricious" because the CDC "failed to adequately explain its reasoning."\n\nSomin does not think much of the latter claim. "While the transportation mask-mandate policy is badly flawed," he says, "it is not so completely ridiculous as to be \'arbitrary and capricious.\'"\n\nBut Somin thinks "there is a very plausible case that the CDC violated the APA" by dodging notice and comment. "Even if the emergency nature of the situation justified bypassing notice-and-comment processes when the policy was first adopted in early 2021," he says, "there is much less excuse for continuing to circumvent normal procedure during the many months that have passed since then. Notice and comment requirements, it should be emphasized, are more than a mere technicality. They allow people affected by regulations to have some voice, and to influence the government to mitigate their burdens."\n\nThe 11th Circuit need not accept all of Mizelle\'s arguments against the mask mandate to agree with her that it was legally invalid. And even if it agrees with the CDC that the mandate fits within Section 264(a), that will not amount to endorsing the sweeping powers that the agency unsuccessfully asserted in the eviction moratorium case, which the Supreme Court already has rejected.\n\nThe Biden administration may be hoping for a different outcome. "If a case is on appeal when the dispute becomes moot for reasons unrelated to the litigation," the Times notes, "an appeals court can remand it to the district court with instructions not only to dismiss the case but to vacate the district court\'s ruling—meaning wipe it from the books." Citing University of Texas at Austin law professor Stephen Vladek, the Times suggests the administration "may be giving itself that option after the mandate\'s planned expiration on May 3." Instead of clarifying the CDC\'s statutory authority, that result would leave it vague, allowing the agency to continue auditioning for the role of disease dictator.', 'image': 'https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2022/04/masked-airline-passengers-4-13-22-Newscom-2-cropped-scaled.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:52'}

She has claimed that alternative explanations for the child\'s death were not explored at trial and her confession had been coerced during a lengthy police interrogation. Her other children had been interviewed and told investigators she never beat them.

While many (myself included!) were happy to be free of masks, it is also true Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle\'s opinion has serious flaws. It was widely panned by commentators, including some (myself again included) who are on the political right, oppose the mask mandate policy, or both. Other examples of such critics include Andrew McCarthy of the National Review, and David French and Sarah Isgur of The Dispatch.\n\nI continue to believe that Judge Mizelle got a lot wrong. But it is important to emphasize there are also some flaws in the administration\'s position. Appellate judges on the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit could still eventually rule against the government. If they do so, that might well be a defensible ruling, so long as they avoid endorsing Mizelle\'s more dubious claims.\n\nIt\'s important to remember that the Eleventh Circuit\'s job is not to grade the lower-court judge\'s performance, but to assess the legal case against the mask mandate. If even one of the arguments against the latter holds, they must rule in favor of the plaintiffs challenging the policy - even if they also conclude (correctly!) that Judge Mizelle made many mistakes in her analysis of other issues in the case.\n\nOne development that casts the government\'s position in a bad light is the Biden administration\'s apparent decision not to seek a stay of the district court\'s ruling. The Justice Department has appealed the district court decision. But they have not asked the Eleventh Circuit to issue a stay until the the appellate panel can reach a final decision. As a result, the district court ruling will remain in effect until the Eleventh Circuit resolves the case - which could easily take weeks or even months.\n\nIf the administration truly believes the mask mandate is an essential public health measure that saves large numbers of people from death or serious illness, one would expect them to seek a stay! Failure to do so is a sign they may not actually have much faith in the official rationale for the mask mandate policy.\n\nExperts sympathetic to the mask mandate policy conjecture that the decision against seeking a stay indicates the administration does not actually care about perpetuating the mask mandate, but is only appealing to preserve the power of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for the future:\n\nDoes the Biden administration really want and intend to fight for a higher court reversal of the ruling this week striking down its mask mandate on airplanes, trains and other public transportation — as its high-profile appeal of the case seemed to suggest? Legal specialists raised another possibility: The administration may instead be buying time and thinking about trying to erase the ruling — a move that would allow it to protect the powers of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to respond to a future crisis — but without reviving a mask mandate. The tell, several outside specialists said, was that the Biden administration was letting days pass without seeking a stay of the ruling, the step that could most immediately resurrect the mask requirement. "Basically, it is giving up on the mask mandate," said Lawrence O. Gostin, a Georgetown University professor of global health law who advised the White House on the case. "The administration\'s goal is a legal principle, which is to ensure that the C.D.C. has strong public health powers to fight Covid and to fight future pandemics. And it appears much less important to them to quickly reinstate the mask mandate…" If the government really wanted to fight its appeal all the way to a decision on whether to overturn Judge Mizelle, said Stephen I. Vladeck, a University of Texas at Austin law professor who specializes in federal courts, "then they totally botched this, because it\'s Thursday and the ruling was on Monday and they haven\'t done anything about it yet." But Mr. Vladeck contended that the failure to seek a stay may make sense if the Biden legal team was instead trying to protect the C.D.C.\'s power with no real intention of trying to get a higher court to reinstate the mask mandate. He pointed to an obscure legal doctrine under which if a case is on appeal when the dispute becomes moot for reasons unrelated to the litigation, an appeals court can remand it to the district court with instructions not only to dismiss the case but to vacate the district court\'s ruling — meaning wipe it from the books. The government, he said, may be giving itself that option after the mandate\'s planned expiration on May 3.\n\nIf Gostin and Vladeck are right, CDC public health policy seems increasingly untrustworthy. In previous posts on the mask mandate policy (see here and here), I noted the serious weaknesses in the case for the transportation mask mandate, and linked it to previous instances where CDC policy seems driven by political pressure from rather than by "following the science." But more damning than the skepticism of outside critics like myself is this apparent indication that even the Biden administration doesn\'t really believe the transportation mask mandate is necessary, and therefore isn\'t actually trying to get it reinstated as soon as possible.\n\nAt the very least, this state of affairs weakens arguments that the CDC deserves special judicial deference to its supposedly apolitical expertise on pandemic-related policy. In reality, agency policy seems heavily politicized.\n\nOne can defend the administration and the CDC on the grounds that, while the legal and policy case for the mask mandate is strong, conservative appellate judges on the Eleventh Circuit are likely to uphold Judge Mizelle\'s decision anyway, because of their supposed bias against public health measures.\n\nThis overlooks the reality that conservative judges - including those on the Supreme Court - have voted to uphold many Covid-era public-health measures that have stronger legal support. Notable examples include recent Supreme Court decisions upholding the Biden administration vaccination mandates for health care workers and for members of the armed forces.\n\nThe implicit prediction that any appellate ruling against the transportation mask mandate would necessarily be a result of incompetence or bias is also wrong because of factors specific to this case.\n\nRecall that Judge Mizelle\'s ruling against the mask mandate was based on 3 justifications: 1) that the policy exceeded the agency\'s powers under 42 U.S.C. Section 264(a), 2) that the CDC violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by failing to go through the notice and comment rule-making process, and 3) the policy was so irrational as to be "arbitrary and capricious."The plaintiffs challenging the mandate need only prevail on one of these three issues to win the case.\n\nI think Judge Mizelle is pretty obviously wrong about the third issue. While the transportation mask-mandate policy is badly flawed, it is not so completely ridiculous as to be "arbitrary and capricious." By contrast, as I noted in my earlier post, there is a very plausible case that the CDC violated the APA. Even if the emergency nature of the situation justified bypassing notice-and-comment processes when the policy was first adopted in early 2021, there is much less excuse for continuing to circumvent normal procedure during the many months that have passed since then. Notice and comment requirements, it should be emphasized, are more than a mere technicality. They allow people affected by regulations to have some voice, and to influence the government to mitigate their burdens.\n\nThe issue of the CDC\'s authority under Section 264(a) is an intermediate case. The plaintiffs\' argument here is weaker than on the APA, but not as weak as on the "arbitrary and capricious" standard.\n\nSection 264(a) gives the CDC the following authority:\n\nThe Surgeon General, with the approval of the [Secretary of Health and Human Services], is authorized to make and enforce such regulations as in his judgment are necessary to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the States or possessions, or from one State or possession into any other State or possession. For purposes of carrying out and enforcing such regulations, the Surgeon General may provide for such inspection, fumigation, disinfection, sanitation, pest extermination, destruction of animals or articles found to be so infected or contaminated as to be sources of dangerous infection to human beings, and other measures, as in his judgment may be necessary. [a later statute gives this authority to the CDC rather than the Surgeon General]\n\nThe government argues that the transportation mask-mandate qualifies as a "sanitation" measure under the terms of the statute. For reasons outlined in my earlier post, Judge Mizelle\'s definition of "sanitation" as limited to "a positive act to make a thing or place clean" doesn\'t make much sense. But I also emphasized that the definition of "sanitation" under the statute must be narrow enough to avoid making the other powers listed in Section 264(a) redundant. In addition, it must be narrow enough to avoid giving the CDC the power to restrict virtually any human activity that might potentially spread disease - which the Supreme Court (correctly) ruled is unacceptable for a wide range of reasons in the eviction moratorium case, which interpreted the very same law.\n\nIn my view, the most plausible definition of sanitation is likely to be one that avoids these two pitfalls, while also allowing the CDC to adopt a transportation mask mandate. But there could potentially be defensible options that exclude the mask mandate - ones more plausible that Judge Mizelle\'s weak theory.\n\nSome commentators, including Andrew McCarthy, suggest that the mask mandate may be authorized by the very first sentence of Section 264(a), which gives the CDC the power to "make and enforce such regulations as in his judgment are necessary to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the States or possessions, or from one State or possession into any other State or possession." If so, the government need not rely on the word "sanitation" in the second sentence.\n\nBut if the first sentence is an independent grant of power, it would run afoul of the Supreme Court\'s ruling in the eviction moratorium case, which held that Section 264(a) cannot be interpreted to give CDC virtually unlimited authority to restrict or shut down nearly any human activity. After all, as I and other critics of the eviction moratorium repeatedly emphasized, almost any form of human interaction risks spreading communicable diseases in some way. Following the Court\'s reasoning in the eviction moratorium case, we should interpret the second sentence of Section 264(a) as setting out the types of regulations the CDC is allowed to enact in its efforts to pursue the public health objectives laid out in the first sentence.\n\nThere are some other issues in the case, which space constraints preclude me from covering here, most notably the question of whether Judge Mizelle was right to order a "nationwide" or "universal" remedy, as opposed to one limited to plaintiffs. But my tentative bottom-line conclusion is that the the case against the transportation-mask mandate is stronger than Judge Mizelle\'s badly flawed opinion makes it seem. On balance, I still think the government has the better-supported legal position. But a ruling against the mandate would be defensible, so long as it avoids the district court\'s particularly egregious errors.', 'image': 'https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2022/03/masked-airline-passengers-iStock-scaled.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:26'}

Nobody but the media and journalists,” said Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee.\n\n“It’s a distraction that some New York Times reporters would rather report on things that Americans don’t care about, instead of focusing on what’s causing the inflation, which is the reckless spending these guys are doing. Those are the issues. The tape’s not.”\n\nWith Trump himself also seeming to revel in the power he exerted through the McCarthy-tape episode, its effect on the California Republican’s future speakership prospects is looking questionable so far. That includes the new Times tape released Tuesday night, which featured McCarthy saying Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) was “putting people in jeopardy” and criticizing Rep. Mo Brooks’ (R-Ala.) behavior surrounding the riot. In the same meeting, McCarthy and his leadership team also criticized the rhetoric of two other members’ surrounding the Jan. 6 attack: Reps. Lauren Boebert (R-Col.) and Barry Moore (R-Ala.).\n\nWithin hours, Gaetz released a fiery statement criticizing the Republican leader and others.\n\n“Rep. McCarthy and Rep. Scalise held views about President Trump and me that they shared on sniveling calls with Liz Cheney, not us,” Gaetz said in a statement. “This is the behavior of weak men, not leaders.”\n\nOther members specifically named in the story held their fire when asked about the McCarthy tape on Tuesday night, with several pointing the blame at the media instead.\n\n“The RINOs engineering this story to promote their own selfish agenda won’t be around next year to prop up the Democrats’ destructive Big Government scheme,” said Moore.\n\nBoebert said, “I haven’t heard anything like that, goodness.”\n\nAnd unlike the first tape, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) was also included as suggesting that what Gaetz did could be “illegal.”\n\n“I haven’t seen what they’re referring to,” Scalise told reporters Tuesday night of the latest tape, which includes a comment from him describing Gaetz’s behavior as “potentially illegal.”\n\n“But it’s not surprising to me that the liberal media wants to keep talking about Jan. 6,” Scalise added. “Because they don’t want to focus on all the crises that President Biden’s created, from inflation to gas prices to the border.”\n\nAs House Republicans started to digest the new McCarthy recording, even some Trump allies who voted to block certification of President Joe Biden’s 2020 victory were undeterred about his questionable denial of the earlier tape.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, who’s also close to McCarthy, said simply that “I’m for Donald Trump being the next president and Kevin McCarthy being the next speaker.”\n\nStill, not all Republicans are ready to let the tapes drama fade. They could be easy ammunition for Republicans who want to squeeze McCarthy for concessions or for new conference members who want to make a name for themselves with the party base as ready to challenge leadership.\n\nRep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, who chaired the Trump-allied House Freedom Caucus until January, told the conservative One America News Network that McCarthy’s comments in the audio “undermined” colleagues who had voted to object to the election.\n\nBiggs added to OANN that McCarthy wasn’t “candid” with other House Republicans that a potential Trump-resignation call was under consideration, and also rapped the GOP leader’s recorded observations about removing some vocal Trump acolytes from social media.\n\nStill, few Republicans were willing to criticize their leader when they arrived back in the Capitol on Tuesday night, their first in-person gathering since the explosive New York Times report last Thursday.\n\nAlabama Rep. Mike Rogers, the top Republican on the Armed Services Committee, argued that the audio was a “nothingburger” that was taken “completely out of context.”\n\n“They were talking about if they had the impeachment hearings, and he was impeached,” Rogers said of Trump. McCarthy, he added, was merely offering a recommendation that Trump step aside before Democrats successfully removed him from the White House.\n\nIn the early days of January 2021, at the time of McCarthy’s recorded call, some House Republicans were wagering that the Senate could vote to convict Trump.\n\n“It’s all inside baseball. Not a single constituent brought up that issue to me,” Rep. Rodney Davis (R-Ill.) said of the McCarthy tape as he walked out of a meeting of senior Republicans.\n\n“Nobody’s talking about it,” Davis added. “And frankly, I can’t wait till Speaker McCarthy is sworn in.”\n\nThe Times’ initial report on McCarthy’s post-insurrection comments — followed a day later by its release of audio from a private GOP meeting — jolted the House Republican conference at a time when many of its members are eager for the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol to retreat from view. McCarthy’s members would much prefer to focus on their efforts to retake the majority come November.\n\nIn the recording, McCarthy is heard telling then-GOP Conference Chair Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) that he was “seriously thinking” of speaking to Trump directly about whether he should resign after the attack on the Capitol.\n\nThe California Republican also told his leadership team on the tape that Trump had personally acknowledged at least some role in goading the rioters that day (which POLITICO reported at the time , citing multiple people with knowledge of the conversation).\n\nTrump “told me he does have some responsibility for what happened and he’d need to acknowledge that,” McCarthy said in the phone call.\n\nMcCarthy briefly addressed the audio in a meeting Tuesday evening with Republican members of leadership and ranking members, four sources in the room told POLITICO. McCarthy told them he didn’t bring up the resignation scenario to Trump, nor did he raise the topic to the broader GOP conference, warning his members not to let the issue divide them.\n\nSources say that the attendees in this meeting, which is stacked with his allies, were all behind the GOP leader and that no one in the meeting sought to challenge him on it.\n\nSome close to Trump have suggested the former president is not angry about the audio — instead, he sees it as a sign of his power because both the Senate and House GOP leaders appeared ready to turn on him after the Capitol siege and have since softened their approach.\n\nOf course, that could change; others say Trump is known for sitting on information that he can later use to deploy against someone who has slighted him.\n\nIn Biggs’ interview with OANN, he took particular issue with Cheney’s participation in the discussion about how to respond to Trump, despite the fact that the call occurred when she would still be expected to participate as a member of GOP leadership. Serious efforts to oust her from the conference’s upper echelons didn’t get underway until weeks after the taped call.\n\n“It is incredibly undermining when we were back in the heat of that” time after the riot by Trump supporters, Biggs told the conservative outlet. “And we have a leader basically negotiating with Liz Cheney over whether he should resign or not, [which] becomes a huge trust issue for me.”\n\nMcCarthy, notably, didn’t quite see Biggs’ remarks as suggesting that the recording could affect his trust in his leader.\n\n“I don’t think that’s what he said,” McCarthy said of Biggs in a brief interview Tuesday night.\n\n“Did you ask Jim Jordan?” the minority leader added, saying that the matter didn’t come up in GOP meetings that afternoon.', 'image': 'https://static.politico.com/30/cc/dfd2767043fcb6b6f61693aeccb7/https-delivery.gettyimages.com/downloads/1386263721', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:54'}

Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) were “putting people in jeopardy.”\n\nThe comments, disclosed in newly released audio from The New York Times, show McCarthy frustrated by the tenor of some of those comments in the days after Jan. 6, 2021 — a feeling that appears to have faded as GOP lawmakers continue to disparage the two Republicans who sit on the committee investigating the riot.\n\n“These members calling out other members, that stuff’s got to stop,” McCarthy can be heard saying in a Jan. 10, 2021 recording on a call with a small group of members of House GOP leadership.\n\n“The tension is too high. The country is too crazy. I do not want to look back and think we caused something. … I don’t want to play politics with any of that,” he added.\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) also called out Gaetz, with another member chiming in to say he had made comments about Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), now the vice chairwoman of the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack.\n\n“This is serious stuff. It has to stop,” he said. “It’s potentially illegal what he’s doing.”\n\nMcCarthy agreed, saying Gaetz was “putting people in jeopardy.”\n\n“And he doesn’t need to be doing this. We saw what people would do in the Capitol, you know, and these people came prepared with rope, with everything else,” he added.\n\nGaetz lashed out at McCarthy and Scalise in a statement Tuesday evening, bashing them for their “sniveling calls with Liz Cheney” and that “they disparage Trump and the Republicans in Congress who fight for him.”\n\n“This is the behavior of weak men, not leaders,” Gaetz said. “They deemed it incendiary or illegal to call Cheney and [Rep. Adam] Kinzinger ‘Anti-Trump,’ a label both proudly advertise today.”\n\nLater in the call, McCarthy and Scalise went over “incendiary remarks” from other lawmakers, noting remarks from Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) and others who spoke at the Jan. 6 rally.\n\n“Today is the day that American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass,” Brooks said at the rally near the White House.\n\n“If you think the president deserves to be impeached for his comments that almost even goes further than the president did,” McCarthy responded.\n\nScalise said that some members had brought up stripping Brooks of his committee assignments “in the vein of Steve King.”\n\nMcCarthy later grimaced over a tweet from Rep. Barry Moore (R-Ala.) commenting on a police shooting involving a Black police officer shooting a white female veteran.\n\n“You know that doesn’t fit the narrative,” he tweeted, and then later deleted.\n\n“Can’t they take their Twitter accounts away too?” McCarthy responded, a nod to Trump’s then-recent booting from the platform.\n\nIn a statement, Moore brushed off McCarthy’s comment.\n\n“The RINOs engineering this story to promote their own selfish agenda won’t be around next year to prop up the Democrats’ destructive Big Government scheme, and Republicans will be more united than ever after taking back the House this November,” Moore said.\n\nBut McCarthy’s reservations in the days after Jan. 6 seem at odds with many of his actions since.\n\nHe did not take any actions to strip Republican members from their committees.\n\nInstead it was Democrats who booted far-right Republicans from their posts, including Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) for tweeting an animated video of him killing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) for endorsing conspiracy theories, racist dogma and violence against Democratic politicians.\n\nThat shift from McCarthy comes as he is determined to remain the leader of the Republican Caucus, an even more coveted job if Republicans are able to retake control of the House.\n\nWhen asked Tuesday if McCarthy was worried the latest tape hurts his chance of maintaining the gavel, he simply replied, “nope.”\n\nMychael Schnell contributed.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/mccarthykevin_040622_ap-J-Scott-Applewhite_mccarthy.jpeg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:11'}

Kevin McCarthy’s obsequious relationship with Donald Trump was in its nascent stages as Trump prepared to assume the presidency in 2017. At a luncheon that January, Trump called McCarthy, the House Republican leader from Bakersfield, “My Kevin.” On inauguration day, McCarthy gave Trump a little pep talk during a quiet moment in the Capitol, just before he walked out to take the oath.\n\n“You’re gonna do great,” McCarthy told Trump before snapping a quick selfie with him.\n\nMcCarthy’s fealty to Trump was distasteful but understandable at the time. Republicans had won the House, the Senate and the presidency. McCarthy saw himself as a unifier who could help the GOP make the most of its new power.\n\nFive years, two impeachments and a deadly insurrection later, McCarthy’s continued allegiance to Trump shows his quest for power lacks a moral compass. Aiming to become the next speaker of the House, McCarthy is willing to ignore the truth that he publicly acknowledged last year — that Trump “bears responsibility” for whipping up the violent mobs that stormed the Capitol while Congress was certifying the election results on Jan. 6, 2021 — and lie about having said privately, in the days following the attack, that he would ask Trump to resign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the New York Times reported last week that McCarthy had told colleagues on a Jan. 10, 2021, phone call that he would ask Trump to step down, McCarthy issued a statement calling the reporting “totally false and wrong.” But it wasn’t. Reporters Alexander Burns and Jonathan Martin released a recording of the phone call in which McCarthy told fellow House Republicans that he planned to call Trump, tell him he believed Congress would impeach him and say, “It would be my recommendation that you should resign.”\n\nOnce upon a time, being caught lying would have been a big deal, particularly about something as grave as how to proceed after a riot to block the peaceful transfer of power. No longer. On Saturday night, McCarthy was warmly received as the keynote speaker at the California Republican Party convention in Anaheim . Attendees were largely unaware of or unfazed by the revelation.\n\n“I just spent four hours in a room with 980 delegates … and this was not a topic of conversation,” Jim Brulte, a former chairman of the California GOP, told an editorial board member on Sunday, adding that it was being covered only because of liberal bias in the media.\n\n“Nobody cares.”\n\nIf McCarthy faces any consequences from Republican members of Congress who could keep him from becoming speaker, it will probably be because Martin and Burns’ growing cache of recordings show that in private he was insufficiently deferential to Trump — not because McCarthy lied. Even then, consequences seem unlikely. Far-right Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida threw a few daggers on social media , then went on Newsmax to say that McCarthy’s ability to raise huge sums of campaign money for Republicans will probably keep him in the good graces of his colleagues.\n\n“Kevin delivers the goods,” Gaetz said . “He really gains his strength not by maintaining some great credibility of truth with people, but by ensuring that he will always be there with the checks.”\n\nAnd that’s where the GOP is today — again rallying around a leader who lies with impunity and, when caught on tape, doubles down on his lies.\n\nVoters decide how much truth matters. But how long can democracy stand when roughly half the voting population is willing to ignore falsehoods and reward political leaders for their dishonesty? Trump’s Big Lie that he won the 2020 election — despite numerous audits and lawsuits that turned up no credible evidence — didn’t come out of nowhere. It began with thousands of falsehoods he spewed during four years as president, and culminated in an attempted coup.\n\nMcCarthy recognized the danger posed by Trump and the Big Lie in the days after Jan. 6, which is why his retreat from truth is all the more appalling. Republican politicians who have kowtowed to Trump are thumbing their nose at the truth. Elected leaders and candidates who ignore or deny the facts are chipping away the foundation of our electoral democracy and they do not deserve your vote.', 'image': 'https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8b76e92/2147483647/strip/true/crop/840x441+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F10%2F8b%2F1d45fdfa4818a3ad65358871d3a6%2Fmccarthy-for-hp.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:07'}

The contents of the recording were first reported by The New York Times in a piece adapted from the upcoming tell-all book, “This Will Not Pass: Trump, Biden and the Battle for America’s Future.”\n\nIn response to the Times’ report, McCarthy tweeted: “The New York Times’ reporting on me is totally false and wrong.”\n\nFallout over the McCarthy tape seemed to breathe new life into the most ardent pro-Trump corners of the GOP\n\nBut the recording categorically refutes his denials.\n\nThe audio, from Jan. 10, 2021, aired on “The Rachel Maddow Show,“ following publication of the Times story. In it, McCarthy can be heard telling fellow Republican leaders, including Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, that he was going to ask Trump to resign.\n\nFallout over the McCarthy tape seemed to breathe new life into the most ardent pro-Trump corners of the GOP, which believe that McCarthy should be replaced as House party leader by the far more Trumpy Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan. Many of Trump’s staunchest supporters in the House had already had enough of McCarthy’s leadership well before this latest controversy.\n\nReplying to a Fox News contributor calling McCarthy a RINO (a Republican in Name Only) after the audio was made public, embattled pro-MAGA Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz tweeted that Jordan was “the hardest working and most talented member of the Republican House Conference. And every member knows it.”\n\nUnsurprisingly, Democrats responded with a mix of astonishment and elation when many learned of McCarthy being caught in a new series of bald-faced lies, thanks to another truth-bearing audio recording. (This also happened to him in 2017.)\n\nMany pundits on the left erroneously leapt to the conclusion that such an overt abrogation of moral principle as the highest-ranking Republican in the House would be, in a practical sense, disqualifying for someone harboring ambitions to become speaker and third in line to the White House next year if the Republicans, as many predict, take back control of the House.\n\nMany Democrats also felt a certain sense of schadenfreude as they mused about the vexing political position McCarthy must have found himself having been outed — in a rare moment of pellucid candor — as being disloyal to Trump, raising questions about whether he could even survive in his party.\n\nBut Democrats should be careful what they wish for, as McCarthy’s potential demise isn’t necessarily a good thing when considering the alternative.\n\nYes, his behavior is despicable and cowardly. But here’s the thing: In the rare moment of candor in which a leaked recording has permitted the world to listen in, McCarthy at least seemed to have the ability to recognize when something is way off. At least he exhibited some modicum of human sensibility, enabling him to recognize gross injustice and culpability, if only to quickly sweep it under the rug for political expediency.\n\nMake no mistake about it: What’s heard on the tape does not make McCarthy the “good guy.” And him telling reporters — a day after the audio was released — that he “never thought” the president should resign underscores that.\n\nBut it could be a lot worse.\n\nOn one hand, we have a pusillanimous, prevaricating and somewhat feeble-minded leader who cows to Trump. But if these tapes ultimately take McCarthy out of the running for House GOP leader, we may be left with something entirely worse. We might be forced to reckon with a ruthless leader like Jordan as head of the House GOP — the same congressman who has refused to cooperate with the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack and who forwarded a text message to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows forcefully pushing an unproven legal theory to try to get then-Vice President Mike Pence to object to certifying the 2020 election results.\n\nIn the “Nicomachean Ethics,” Aristotle wrote that “for the lesser evil is reckoned a good in comparison with the greater evil.” Although he penned those words over two millennia ago, he was aptly describing the situation the country finds itself in today, with one of its major parties having to choose between two different shades of awful when it comes to its congressional leadership. But let’s be honest: McCarthy is clearly the lesser of two evils. If someone like Jordan were to take the gavel of the U.S. House of Representatives, the nation would be stepping into very dangerous, uncharted territory.\n\nFortunately, criticism of McCarthy within the GOP seems to have dissipated somewhat as news emerged that he had called Trump to apologize after his audio became national news and that the former president was not particularly upset about the recorded remarks — a move that may muzzle grumblings about McCarthy among Trump’s legion of dedicated supporters in Congress.\n\nMcCarthy knows that any path to the speakership depends on him continuing to be in the former president’s good graces.

Andy Biggs (Ariz.) in a new interview said comments made by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) in the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol pose a “huge trust issue.”\n\nBiggs, a former chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told One America News (OAN) in an interview that he believes McCarthy has work to do to regain the confidence of some GOP lawmakers and Trump supporters in Congress.\n\n“It’s incredibly undermining when we were back in the heat of that, and a lot of people may forget what a mere 16 months ago was like, but it was hot and heavy, and those of us who were trying to fight for truth and accuracy to come out and understanding that there was going to be an impeachment 10 days before President Trump is leaving office, and we have our leader that’s basically negotiating with [Rep.] Liz Cheney [R-Wyo.] on whether he should encourage President Trump to resign or not becomes a huge, huge trust issue for me,” Biggs said.\n\nBiggs is the latest GOP lawmaker to criticize McCarthy as he comes under fire for comments made during a call with Republican leadership on Jan. 10, 2021. During that conversation, as was reported by The New York Times, McCarthy said he would recommend that then-President Trump resign from office.\n\nCheney, who at the time was the chairwoman of the House GOP conference, was also heard on the call with McCarthy.\n\nThe minority leader quickly called the report “totally false and wrong,” but audio recordings later corroborated he had made the comments.\n\nThe saga is now reverberating throughout Washington, with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle weighing in on the remarks themselves, in addition to McCarthy’s initial denial. It comes at a consequential moment for the Republican Party as it looks to take control of the House in November — a situation that would likely hand McCarthy the Speaker’s gavel.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) last week accused McCarthy of standing by Cheney, and Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), a frequent critic of Trump and McCarthy, said that the minority leader “ought to be ashamed” for lying about the comments.\n\nBiggs told OAN he has “several problems” with the tapes, including that McCarthy was “undermining” the Republican conference when others were working to defend Trump.\n\nHe also took issue with McCarthy not being candid with his Republican colleagues.\n\n“He was not candid with conference. He wasn’t telling us what his position was,” Biggs said. “And the fact that he was working with Liz Cheney, who was always a ‘Never Trumper,’ is particularly problematic as well. So he was dissembling to the conference.”\n\nThe third point Biggs criticized was a comment McCarthy made on the call in which he, according to the Times, said he wished large tech companies would boot some GOP lawmakers from social media platforms, similar to what Twitter and Facebook did to Trump after the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nMcCarthy’s spokesman, however, told the newspaper that the Republican leader “never said particular members should be removed from Twitter.”\n\nBiggs told OAN that the remark from McCarthy was “problematic.”\n\n“The third thing, and this is perhaps the most serious thing as well — I mean, all of these are serious — is that he is recorded as saying that if we supported Trump, that we should be removed from our social media platforms,” Biggs said.\n\nThe Arizona Republican said he wished McCarthy had been “honest and truthful” with the GOP conference at the time of the comments so they would not be an issue now, when the party is looking ahead to the midterms.\n\n“The unfortunate thing for us now is if he would have just been honest and truthful to us way back then, this would not be an issue today, and we don’t want it to be an issue because we don’t want it to be a distraction because we are moving forward … [with] tremendous momentum to retake the house,” he added.\n\nBiggs said he has “no reason to doubt” that McCarthy’s comments on the call were his “true intentions and feelings.”\n\nThe Hill reached out to McCarthy for comment.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/biggsandy_102121gn_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:52'}

Photograph: Alexei Alexandrov/AP\n\n\n\n50m ago 01.06 Zelenskiy reiterated Russia’s threat to nuclear security in his national address after meeting with director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Mariano Grossi. No other country in the world since 1986 has posed such a major threat to nuclear security, to Europe and the world, that Russia has posed since February 24. Russia kept a contingent in the Chernobyl zone with armoured vehicles, which destroyed the soil surface and raised an extraordinary amount of dust into the air, including radioactive particles.” Zelenskiy added that Russia has “no right to turn nuclear energy into weapons”, as well as to blackmail the world with nuclear weapons. We called everyone, we wanted a tough reaction from the world. We warned everyone that there could be a new nuclear catastrophe at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is like six Chernobyls, and that it could simply destroy Europe.”\n\n\n\n1h ago 00.50 \'The free world has the right to self-defence,\' Zelenskiy says Zelenskiy has said the “free world has the right to self-defence” after predicting that Russia intends to not only seize the territory of Ukraine but to “dismember the entire centre and east of Europe” and “deal a global blow to democracy”. There are almost no people left in the free world who do not understand that Russia’s war against Ukraine is just the beginning. The ultimate goal of Russia’s leadership is not just to seize the territory of Ukraine, but to dismember the entire centre and east of Europe and deal a global blow to democracy. Therefore, the free world has the right to self-defence. And that is why it will help Ukraine even more.”\n\n\n\n1h ago 00.39 Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said “no one in the world can feel safe” after Russia threatened Ukraine’s nuclear facilities and called for “global control” over Russia’s nuclear facilities and nuclear technology. In his national address this evening, Zelenskiy said:\n\nI believe that after all that the Russian military has done in the Chernobyl zone and at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, no one in the world can feel safe knowing how many nuclear facilities, nuclear weapons and related technologies the Russian state has. If Russia has forgotten what Chernobyl is, it means that global control over Russia’s nuclear facilities and nuclear technology is needed.” Addressing the latest threats to nuclear safety, Zelenskiy said Russia launched three missiles against Ukraine on Tuesday so that they “flew directly over the blocks of our nuclear power plants”. “Over three nuclear power plants at once. Over Zaporizhzhia, Khmelnytskyi and South-Ukrainian NPPs,” he added. Russian troops that were trying to attack Kyiv through the Chernobyl zone used the restricted area as a military base. They set up positions on land where it is forbidden to even stand. They drove armoured vehicles through areas where radiation-contaminated materials are buried and where the number of radioactive particles is simply horrendous. They destroyed the dosimetric control points. The Chernobyl radiation monitoring system was broken and looted. They looted a nuclear analytical laboratory...”\n\n\n\n2h ago 00.18 US state department spokesman Ned Price responded to Lavrov’s comments, saying they were part of a “pattern of bellicose statements” from Russia, which he branded “irresponsible” and “a clear attempt to distract from its failure in Ukraine.” Loose talk of nuclear weapons, nuclear escalation is especially irresponsible, it is the height of irresponsibility,” Price told reporters on Tuesday. Price said the US was paying close attention “to Russia’s activities, to what it’s doing and what it’s not doing” but added that the US saw no reason to change its own nuclear posture.\n\n\n\n2h ago 00.05 Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has said that the danger of nuclear war is “serious” and the core of any agreement to end the conflict in Ukraine would depend largely on the military situation on the ground. Russia, Lavrov said in an interview broadcast on state television, was doing a lot to uphold the principle of striving to prevent nuclear war at all costs. This is our key position on which we base everything. The risks now are considerable. I would not want to elevate those risks artificially. Many would like that. The danger is serious, real. And we must not underestimate it.” Lavrov, defending Moscow’s actions, also blamed Washington for the lack of dialogue. “The United States has practically ceased all contacts simply because we were obliged to defend Russians in Ukraine,” Lavrov said, repeating the rationale for Moscow’s invasion of its southern neighbour. But he said western supplies of sophisticated weapons, including Javelin anti-tank missiles, armoured vehicles and advanced drones were provocative measures calculated to prolong the conflict rather than bring it to an end. “These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia’s military acting within the context of the special operation,” Lavrov said. “Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?” he added. “Nato, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.”\n\n\n\n2h ago 23.45 The UN General Assembly took a first step to put the five permanent members of the Security Council under a global spotlight on Tuesday when they use their veto power, a move highlighted by Russia’s veto and threat of future vetoes that has paralysed any action by the UN’s most powerful body on the Ukraine war, the Associated Press is reporting. The resolution does not eliminate or limit the veto power of the permanent members - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France. But for the first time it will require the General Assembly “to hold a debate on the situation” that sparks a veto in the Security Council within 10 working days, and to give precedence on the list of speakers to the permanent member who cast the veto. The assembly isn’t required to take or consider any action, but the discussion could put veto-wielders on the spot and let a raft of other countries be heard. Liechtenstein’s UN ambassador, Christian Wenaweser, who spearheaded the resolution, has said it aims “to promote the voice of all of us who are not veto-holders, and who are not on the Security Council, on matters of international peace and security because they affect all of us.” Presenting the resolution to the assembly on Tuesday morning, Wenaweser alluded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the Security Council’s failure to take action saying: “There has never been a stronger need for effective multilateralism than today, and there has never been a stronger need for innovation in order to secure the central role and voice of the United Nations.”\n\n\n\n3h ago 23.17 Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy believes Russia is trying to destabilise the situation in the Transnistrian region, while Ukrainian armed forces are ready for a possible escalation by Russian troops in the temporarily occupied territory of the Republic of Moldova. Answering journalists’ questions after a meeting with IAEA director general Rafael Mariano Grossi in Kyiv, Zelenskiy said that he fully shares the assessment of the situation by Moldovan President Maia Sandu. Zelenskiy also said that he discussed that issue with Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Ciucă who was in Kyiv on Tuesday. We clearly understand that this is one of the steps of the Russian Federation. The special services are working there. It’s not just about fake news. The goal is obvious - to destabilise the situation in the region, to threaten Moldova. They show that if Moldova supports Ukraine, there will be certain steps.” According to Zelenskiy, Ukraine knows that the Russian troops, which have been present in the territory of the temporarily occupied part of Moldova - Transnistria for many years, are in “constant readiness”. “But we understand their capabilities, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are ready for this and are not afraid of them,” he added.\n\nUpdated at 23.21 BST\n\n3h ago 22.54 Britain’s Foreign Minister Elizabeth Truss is expected to call on allies of Ukraine to “ramp up” military production including of planes and tanks, the AFP is reporting after reviewing a preview of a speech to be delivered on Wednesday. In her speech, called the new approach, Truss says the UK’s new approach “will be based on three areas: military strength, economic security and deeper global alliances”. “We cannot be complacent - the fate of Ukraine remains in the balance,” her speech reads. Russia’s victory will have “terrible consequences across the globe”, Truss is expected to say. “We must be prepared for the long haul and double down on our support for Ukraine. “Heavy weapons, tanks, aeroplanes – digging deep into our inventories, ramping up production. We need to do all of this.” “There must be nowhere for Putin to go to fund this appalling war,” her speech continues. “The architecture that was designed to guarantee peace and prosperity has failed Ukraine.” “We must also follow through on the unity shown in this crisis to reboot, recast and remodel our approach to deterring aggressors.” Truss will also call for “free nations” to be “more assertive and self-confident”, according to AFP.\n\nUpdated at 23.00 BST\n\n3h ago 22.31 A senior US defense official told reporters on Tuesday that the Department of Defense established a control center in Germany to assist in the distribution of US military aid to Ukraine, CNN is reporting.

It’s run by a two-star military general and works with the international donor coordination center or IDCC.\n\n\n\n4h ago 22.18 White House press secretary Jen Psaki said while the US doesn’t expect to encounter any food shortages as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the administration is working to “bolster food security around the globe” both independently and with allies.

In addition to Poland, Gazprom has announced that it would stop delivering gas to Bulgaria after demanding that countries pay for gas in rubles. Gazprom executives were quoted by Russian news agencies as saying “Poland must pay for gas supplies according to the new payment procedure”. However, it was not immediately clear whether Bulgaria has refused to pay in rubles as well. “Bulgargaz received a notification today, April 26, that natural gas supplies from Gazprom Export will be suspended starting April 27,” Bulgaria’s economy ministry said in a statement. More from AFP: Bulgaria’s energy ministry also said Tuesday that its state-owned gas operators Bulgargaz and Bulgartransgaz “have undertaken steps for alternative agreements for natural gas deliveries and for coping with the current situation”. “At present, there is no need for (imposing) any restrictive measures on consumption,” it added.

General Smedley Butler in 1935. He explained: "A racket is best described, I believe, as something that is not what it seems to the majority of the people. Only a small \'inside\' group knows what it is about. .”It is conducted for the benefit of the very few, at the expense of the very many. Out of war a few people make huge fortunes."\n\nGen. Butler’s observation describes the US/NATO response to the Ukraine war perfectly.\n\nThe propaganda continues to portray the war in Ukraine as that of an unprovoked Goliath out to decimate an innocent David unless we in the US and NATO contribute massive amounts of military equipment to Ukraine to defeat Russia. As is always the case with propaganda, this version of events is manipulated to bring an emotional response to the benefit of special interests.\n\nOne group of special interests profiting massively on the war is the US military-industrial complex. Raytheon CEO Greg Hayes recently told a meeting of shareholders that, "Everything that ‘s being shipped into Ukraine today, of course, is coming out of stockpiles, either at DOD or from our NATO allies, and that’s all great news. Eventually we’ll have to replenish it and we will see a benefit to the business."\n\nHe wasn’t lying. Raytheon, along with Lockheed Martin and countless other weapons manufacturers are enjoying a windfall they have not seen in years. The US has committed more than three billion dollars in military aid to Ukraine. They call it aid, but it is actually corporate welfare: Washington sending billions to arms manufacturers for weapons sent overseas.\n\nBy many accounts these shipments of weapons like the Javelin anti-tank missile (jointly manufactured by Raytheon and Lockheed Martin) are getting blown up as soon as they arrive in Ukraine. This doesn’t bother Raytheon at all. The more weapons blown up by Russia in Ukraine, the more new orders come from the Pentagon.\n\nFormer Warsaw Pact countries now members of NATO are in on the scam as well. They’ve discovered how to dispose of their 30-year-old Soviet-made weapons and receive modern replacements from the US and other western NATO countries.\n\nWhile many who sympathize with Ukraine are cheering, this multi-billion dollar weapons package will make little difference. As former US Marine intelligence officer Scott Ritter said on the Ron Paul Liberty Report last week:\n\n"I can say with absolute certainty that even if this aid makes it to the battlefield, it will have zero impact on the battle. And Joe Biden knows it."\n\nWhat we do see is that Russians are capturing modern US and NATO weapons by the ton and even using them to kill more Ukrainians. What irony. Also, what kinds of opportunities will be provided to terrorists, with thousands of tons of deadly high-tech weapons floating around Europe? Washington has admitted that it has no way of tracking the weapons it is sending to Ukraine and no way to keep them out of the hands of the bad guys.\n\nWar is a racket, to be sure. The US has been meddling in Ukraine since the end of the Cold War, going so far as overthrowing the government in 2014 and planting the seeds of the war we are witnessing today. The only way out of a hole is to stop digging. Don’t expect that any time soon.

But the report stops short of recommending direct financial reparations, and officials have no immediate plans for that kind of support.\n\nHarvard, the nation’s oldest and wealthiest college, is the latest among a growing number of U.S. schools attempting to confront their involvement with slavery and also make amends for it.\n\nThe report, commissioned by Bacow, found that Harvard’s faculty, staff and leaders enslaved more than 70 Black and Native American people from the school’s founding in 1636 to 1783. It cautions that the figure is “almost certainly an undercount.” Using historical records, researchers were able to identify dozens of enslaved people by name, along with their connection to the university.\n\nMost were identified only by a single name, such as Cesar, Dinah and Venus.\n\n“Enslaved men and women served Harvard presidents and professors and fed and cared for Harvard students,” researchers found. “Moreover, throughout this period and well into the 19th century, the University and its donors benefited from extensive financial ties to slavery.”\n\nThe report says the university “should make a significant monetary commitment, and it should invest in remedies of equal or greater breadth than other universities.” Bacow said Harvard will attempt to redress its wrongs through “teaching, research and service." He is creating a committee to implement the report\'s suggestions.\n\nBuilding on earlier research at Harvard, the report details how the university depended on the slave trade in its early years and profited from it for decades.\n\nHarvard invested directly in the sugar and rum trades in the Caribbean, along with the U.S. cotton and railroad industries. The college\'s early growth is credited to support from wealthy donors who accumulated their fortunes through the slave trade and industries that relied on it.\n\nAlong with the 70 people who were enslaved, the report also lists their enslavers — including several Harvard presidents and high-ranking officials — and the campus buildings, rooms and professorships that are still named after them.\n\nEven after slavery was abolished, the report says, prominent scholars continued to promote concepts that fueled racist ideas.\n\nIt cites work by 19th century professor Louis Agassiz, who pushed discredited theories on “race science” and eugenics. Another scholar led a “physical education” program that collected students’ physical measurements to support research advancing eugenic theories.\n\nIn his message, Bacow called the findings “disturbing and shocking,” and he acknowledged that the school “perpetuated practices that were profoundly immoral.”\n\n“Consequently, I believe we bear a moral responsibility to do what we can to address the persistent corrosive effects of those historical practices on individuals, on Harvard, and on our society,” he wrote.\n\nThe 130-page report included a series of recommendations that Bacow endorsed. The $100 million will be used to carry out the work, with some funding to be made available now and more to be held in an endowment. The university itself has an endowment of more than $50 billion, the largest in the nation.\n\nThe report says Harvard should identify the descendants of enslaved people and engage with them “through dialogue, programming, information sharing, relationship building and educational support.”\n\n“Through such efforts, these descendants can recover their histories, tell their stories and pursue empowering knowledge,” the report said.\n\nMore broadly, it urges Harvard to fight racial inequality by expanding education options for descendants of enslaved people, especially in the South and the Caribbean. It calls on the university to work closely with historically Black colleges across the country, with new funding to bring students and scholars to Harvard for up to a year at a time.\n\nAnd acknowledging the enslavement of Native Americans, it calls on Harvard to build closer ties with New England tribes. Harvard should recruit more students from tribal communities, the report says, and organize a national conference promoting research on the enslavement of Indigenous people.\n\nIn accepting the recommendations, Harvard joins an increasing number of colleges attempting to move from research to action as they reconcile with their histories.\n\nGeorgetown University in 2019 promised to raise $400,000 a year for the descendants of enslaved people sold by the school. The Princeton Theological Seminary created a $27.6 million reparative endowment. The University of Virginia established scholarships for the descendants of enslaved people.\n\nHarvard formally began exploring its ties to slavery in 2016, when former President Drew Gilpin Faust acknowledged that the school was “directly complicit in America’s system of racial bondage." Faust organized a committee to study the topic and had a plaque installed on campus honoring enslaved people who labored there.\n\nStudent activists had been shining a light on Harvard\'s darker histories for years. In 2015, students demanded that Harvard Law School abandon its official crest, which was tied to an 18th century donor whose family enslaved dozens of people. Months later, the school retired the symbol.\n\nSoon after becoming president, Bacow established a new Presidential Initiative on Harvard and the Legacy of Slavery to dig deeper into the university\'s role. That effort led to the new report.\n\n“The Harvard that I have known, while far from perfect, has always tried to be better — to bring our lived experience ever closer to our high ideals,” Bacow wrote. “In releasing this report and committing ourselves to following through on its recommendations, we continue a long tradition of embracing the challenges before us.”', 'image': '/static/img/wln_alt.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:14'}

The university also appointed a committee chaired by Martha Minow, former dean of Harvard Law School, to move recommendations into action and committed $100 million to fund its initiative.\n\n“The legacy of slavery, including the persistence of both overt and subtle discrimination against people of color, continues to influence the world in the form of disparities in education, health, wealth, income, social mobility, and almost any other metric we might use to measure equality,” Bacow said in a statement. “Consequently, I believe we bear a moral responsibility to do what we can to address the persistent corrosive effects of those historical practices on individuals, on Harvard, and on our society.”\n\nHarvard’s report revealed dozens of individuals — including five of the university’s previous presidents — enslaved African and Indigenous people, according to city vital records, wills and other documents.\n\nIn recent years, several other colleges have started reckoning with their ties to slavery and indentured servitude. The University of Mississippi and Georgetown University revealed that they benefited from slave labor, while Brown University students voted in March 2021 for the institution to offer reparations to descendants of enslaved laborers. Columbia University also publicly marked its ties to slavery by adding historical markers to four of its residence halls, including Furnald Hall — which was home to Frederick Wells, the first Black student to live on campus and who was harassed by Ku Klux Klan members.\n\nWhile reviewing Harvard’s history of slavery may be troubling, Bacow said, he strongly encouraged all students, faculty and other members of the university community to read the report.\n\n“Many of you will find it disturbing and even shocking,” Bacow said. “Many of you may also be disappointed in learning painful truths about the history of an institution that you have come to know, respect, and even love. But the Harvard that I have known, while far from perfect, has always tried to be better—to bring our lived experience ever closer to our high ideals.

Nobody but the media and journalists,” said Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee.\n\n“It’s a distraction that some New York Times reporters would rather report on things that Americans don’t care about, instead of focusing on what’s causing the inflation, which is the reckless spending these guys are doing. Those are the issues. The tape’s not.”\n\nWith Trump himself also seeming to revel in the power he exerted through the McCarthy-tape episode, its effect on the California Republican’s future speakership prospects is looking questionable so far. That includes the new Times tape released Tuesday night, which featured McCarthy saying Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) was “putting people in jeopardy” and criticizing Rep. Mo Brooks’ (R-Ala.) behavior surrounding the riot. In the same meeting, McCarthy and his leadership team also criticized the rhetoric of two other members’ surrounding the Jan. 6 attack: Reps. Lauren Boebert (R-Col.) and Barry Moore (R-Ala.).\n\nWithin hours, Gaetz released a fiery statement criticizing the Republican leader and others.\n\n“Rep. McCarthy and Rep. Scalise held views about President Trump and me that they shared on sniveling calls with Liz Cheney, not us,” Gaetz said in a statement. “This is the behavior of weak men, not leaders.”\n\nOther members specifically named in the story held their fire when asked about the McCarthy tape on Tuesday night, with several pointing the blame at the media instead.\n\n“The RINOs engineering this story to promote their own selfish agenda won’t be around next year to prop up the Democrats’ destructive Big Government scheme,” said Moore.\n\nBoebert said, “I haven’t heard anything like that, goodness.”\n\nAnd unlike the first tape, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) was also included as suggesting that what Gaetz did could be “illegal.”\n\n“I haven’t seen what they’re referring to,” Scalise told reporters Tuesday night of the latest tape, which includes a comment from him describing Gaetz’s behavior as “potentially illegal.”\n\n“But it’s not surprising to me that the liberal media wants to keep talking about Jan. 6,” Scalise added. “Because they don’t want to focus on all the crises that President Biden’s created, from inflation to gas prices to the border.”\n\nAs House Republicans started to digest the new McCarthy recording, even some Trump allies who voted to block certification of President Joe Biden’s 2020 victory were undeterred about his questionable denial of the earlier tape.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, who’s also close to McCarthy, said simply that “I’m for Donald Trump being the next president and Kevin McCarthy being the next speaker.”\n\nStill, not all Republicans are ready to let the tapes drama fade. They could be easy ammunition for Republicans who want to squeeze McCarthy for concessions or for new conference members who want to make a name for themselves with the party base as ready to challenge leadership.\n\nRep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, who chaired the Trump-allied House Freedom Caucus until January, told the conservative One America News Network that McCarthy’s comments in the audio “undermined” colleagues who had voted to object to the election.\n\nBiggs added to OANN that McCarthy wasn’t “candid” with other House Republicans that a potential Trump-resignation call was under consideration, and also rapped the GOP leader’s recorded observations about removing some vocal Trump acolytes from social media.\n\nStill, few Republicans were willing to criticize their leader when they arrived back in the Capitol on Tuesday night, their first in-person gathering since the explosive New York Times report last Thursday.\n\nAlabama Rep. Mike Rogers, the top Republican on the Armed Services Committee, argued that the audio was a “nothingburger” that was taken “completely out of context.”\n\n“They were talking about if they had the impeachment hearings, and he was impeached,” Rogers said of Trump. McCarthy, he added, was merely offering a recommendation that Trump step aside before Democrats successfully removed him from the White House.\n\nIn the early days of January 2021, at the time of McCarthy’s recorded call, some House Republicans were wagering that the Senate could vote to convict Trump.\n\n“It’s all inside baseball. Not a single constituent brought up that issue to me,” Rep. Rodney Davis (R-Ill.) said of the McCarthy tape as he walked out of a meeting of senior Republicans.\n\n“Nobody’s talking about it,” Davis added. “And frankly, I can’t wait till Speaker McCarthy is sworn in.”\n\nThe Times’ initial report on McCarthy’s post-insurrection comments — followed a day later by its release of audio from a private GOP meeting — jolted the House Republican conference at a time when many of its members are eager for the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol to retreat from view. McCarthy’s members would much prefer to focus on their efforts to retake the majority come November.\n\nIn the recording, McCarthy is heard telling then-GOP Conference Chair Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) that he was “seriously thinking” of speaking to Trump directly about whether he should resign after the attack on the Capitol.\n\nThe California Republican also told his leadership team on the tape that Trump had personally acknowledged at least some role in goading the rioters that day (which POLITICO reported at the time , citing multiple people with knowledge of the conversation).\n\nTrump “told me he does have some responsibility for what happened and he’d need to acknowledge that,” McCarthy said in the phone call.\n\nMcCarthy briefly addressed the audio in a meeting Tuesday evening with Republican members of leadership and ranking members, four sources in the room told POLITICO. McCarthy told them he didn’t bring up the resignation scenario to Trump, nor did he raise the topic to the broader GOP conference, warning his members not to let the issue divide them.\n\nSources say that the attendees in this meeting, which is stacked with his allies, were all behind the GOP leader and that no one in the meeting sought to challenge him on it.\n\nSome close to Trump have suggested the former president is not angry about the audio — instead, he sees it as a sign of his power because both the Senate and House GOP leaders appeared ready to turn on him after the Capitol siege and have since softened their approach.\n\nOf course, that could change; others say Trump is known for sitting on information that he can later use to deploy against someone who has slighted him.\n\nIn Biggs’ interview with OANN, he took particular issue with Cheney’s participation in the discussion about how to respond to Trump, despite the fact that the call occurred when she would still be expected to participate as a member of GOP leadership. Serious efforts to oust her from the conference’s upper echelons didn’t get underway until weeks after the taped call.\n\n“It is incredibly undermining when we were back in the heat of that” time after the riot by Trump supporters, Biggs told the conservative outlet. “And we have a leader basically negotiating with Liz Cheney over whether he should resign or not, [which] becomes a huge trust issue for me.”\n\nMcCarthy, notably, didn’t quite see Biggs’ remarks as suggesting that the recording could affect his trust in his leader.\n\n“I don’t think that’s what he said,” McCarthy said of Biggs in a brief interview Tuesday night.\n\n“Did you ask Jim Jordan?” the minority leader added, saying that the matter didn’t come up in GOP meetings that afternoon.', 'image': 'https://static.politico.com/30/cc/dfd2767043fcb6b6f61693aeccb7/https-delivery.gettyimages.com/downloads/1386263721', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:54'}

Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) were “putting people in jeopardy.”\n\nThe comments, disclosed in newly released audio from The New York Times, show McCarthy frustrated by the tenor of some of those comments in the days after Jan. 6, 2021 — a feeling that appears to have faded as GOP lawmakers continue to disparage the two Republicans who sit on the committee investigating the riot.\n\n“These members calling out other members, that stuff’s got to stop,” McCarthy can be heard saying in a Jan. 10, 2021 recording on a call with a small group of members of House GOP leadership.\n\n“The tension is too high. The country is too crazy. I do not want to look back and think we caused something. … I don’t want to play politics with any of that,” he added.\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) also called out Gaetz, with another member chiming in to say he had made comments about Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), now the vice chairwoman of the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack.\n\n“This is serious stuff. It has to stop,” he said. “It’s potentially illegal what he’s doing.”\n\nMcCarthy agreed, saying Gaetz was “putting people in jeopardy.”\n\n“And he doesn’t need to be doing this. We saw what people would do in the Capitol, you know, and these people came prepared with rope, with everything else,” he added.\n\nGaetz lashed out at McCarthy and Scalise in a statement Tuesday evening, bashing them for their “sniveling calls with Liz Cheney” and that “they disparage Trump and the Republicans in Congress who fight for him.”\n\n“This is the behavior of weak men, not leaders,” Gaetz said. “They deemed it incendiary or illegal to call Cheney and [Rep. Adam] Kinzinger ‘Anti-Trump,’ a label both proudly advertise today.”\n\nLater in the call, McCarthy and Scalise went over “incendiary remarks” from other lawmakers, noting remarks from Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) and others who spoke at the Jan. 6 rally.\n\n“Today is the day that American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass,” Brooks said at the rally near the White House.\n\n“If you think the president deserves to be impeached for his comments that almost even goes further than the president did,” McCarthy responded.\n\nScalise said that some members had brought up stripping Brooks of his committee assignments “in the vein of Steve King.”\n\nMcCarthy later grimaced over a tweet from Rep. Barry Moore (R-Ala.) commenting on a police shooting involving a Black police officer shooting a white female veteran.\n\n“You know that doesn’t fit the narrative,” he tweeted, and then later deleted.\n\n“Can’t they take their Twitter accounts away too?” McCarthy responded, a nod to Trump’s then-recent booting from the platform.\n\nIn a statement, Moore brushed off McCarthy’s comment.\n\n“The RINOs engineering this story to promote their own selfish agenda won’t be around next year to prop up the Democrats’ destructive Big Government scheme, and Republicans will be more united than ever after taking back the House this November,” Moore said.\n\nBut McCarthy’s reservations in the days after Jan. 6 seem at odds with many of his actions since.\n\nHe did not take any actions to strip Republican members from their committees.\n\nInstead it was Democrats who booted far-right Republicans from their posts, including Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) for tweeting an animated video of him killing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) for endorsing conspiracy theories, racist dogma and violence against Democratic politicians.\n\nThat shift from McCarthy comes as he is determined to remain the leader of the Republican Caucus, an even more coveted job if Republicans are able to retake control of the House.\n\nWhen asked Tuesday if McCarthy was worried the latest tape hurts his chance of maintaining the gavel, he simply replied, “nope.”\n\nMychael Schnell contributed.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/mccarthykevin_040622_ap-J-Scott-Applewhite_mccarthy.jpeg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:11'}

Kevin McCarthy’s obsequious relationship with Donald Trump was in its nascent stages as Trump prepared to assume the presidency in 2017. At a luncheon that January, Trump called McCarthy, the House Republican leader from Bakersfield, “My Kevin.” On inauguration day, McCarthy gave Trump a little pep talk during a quiet moment in the Capitol, just before he walked out to take the oath.\n\n“You’re gonna do great,” McCarthy told Trump before snapping a quick selfie with him.\n\nMcCarthy’s fealty to Trump was distasteful but understandable at the time. Republicans had won the House, the Senate and the presidency. McCarthy saw himself as a unifier who could help the GOP make the most of its new power.\n\nFive years, two impeachments and a deadly insurrection later, McCarthy’s continued allegiance to Trump shows his quest for power lacks a moral compass. Aiming to become the next speaker of the House, McCarthy is willing to ignore the truth that he publicly acknowledged last year — that Trump “bears responsibility” for whipping up the violent mobs that stormed the Capitol while Congress was certifying the election results on Jan. 6, 2021 — and lie about having said privately, in the days following the attack, that he would ask Trump to resign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the New York Times reported last week that McCarthy had told colleagues on a Jan. 10, 2021, phone call that he would ask Trump to step down, McCarthy issued a statement calling the reporting “totally false and wrong.” But it wasn’t. Reporters Alexander Burns and Jonathan Martin released a recording of the phone call in which McCarthy told fellow House Republicans that he planned to call Trump, tell him he believed Congress would impeach him and say, “It would be my recommendation that you should resign.”\n\nOnce upon a time, being caught lying would have been a big deal, particularly about something as grave as how to proceed after a riot to block the peaceful transfer of power. No longer. On Saturday night, McCarthy was warmly received as the keynote speaker at the California Republican Party convention in Anaheim . Attendees were largely unaware of or unfazed by the revelation.\n\n“I just spent four hours in a room with 980 delegates … and this was not a topic of conversation,” Jim Brulte, a former chairman of the California GOP, told an editorial board member on Sunday, adding that it was being covered only because of liberal bias in the media.\n\n“Nobody cares.”\n\nIf McCarthy faces any consequences from Republican members of Congress who could keep him from becoming speaker, it will probably be because Martin and Burns’ growing cache of recordings show that in private he was insufficiently deferential to Trump — not because McCarthy lied. Even then, consequences seem unlikely. Far-right Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida threw a few daggers on social media , then went on Newsmax to say that McCarthy’s ability to raise huge sums of campaign money for Republicans will probably keep him in the good graces of his colleagues.\n\n“Kevin delivers the goods,” Gaetz said . “He really gains his strength not by maintaining some great credibility of truth with people, but by ensuring that he will always be there with the checks.”\n\nAnd that’s where the GOP is today — again rallying around a leader who lies with impunity and, when caught on tape, doubles down on his lies.\n\nVoters decide how much truth matters. But how long can democracy stand when roughly half the voting population is willing to ignore falsehoods and reward political leaders for their dishonesty? Trump’s Big Lie that he won the 2020 election — despite numerous audits and lawsuits that turned up no credible evidence — didn’t come out of nowhere. It began with thousands of falsehoods he spewed during four years as president, and culminated in an attempted coup.\n\nMcCarthy recognized the danger posed by Trump and the Big Lie in the days after Jan. 6, which is why his retreat from truth is all the more appalling. Republican politicians who have kowtowed to Trump are thumbing their nose at the truth. Elected leaders and candidates who ignore or deny the facts are chipping away the foundation of our electoral democracy and they do not deserve your vote.', 'image': 'https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8b76e92/2147483647/strip/true/crop/840x441+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F10%2F8b%2F1d45fdfa4818a3ad65358871d3a6%2Fmccarthy-for-hp.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:07'}

It comes at a consequential moment for the Republican Party as it looks to take control of the House in November — a situation that would likely hand McCarthy the Speaker’s gavel.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) last week accused McCarthy of standing by Cheney, and Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), a frequent critic of Trump and McCarthy, said that the minority leader “ought to be ashamed” for lying about the comments.\n\nBiggs told OAN he has “several problems” with the tapes, including that McCarthy was “undermining” the Republican conference when others were working to defend Trump.\n\nHe also took issue with McCarthy not being candid with his Republican colleagues.\n\n“He was not candid with conference. He wasn’t telling us what his position was,” Biggs said. “And the fact that he was working with Liz Cheney, who was always a ‘Never Trumper,’ is particularly problematic as well. So he was dissembling to the conference.”\n\nThe third point Biggs criticized was a comment McCarthy made on the call in which he, according to the Times, said he wished large tech companies would boot some GOP lawmakers from social media platforms, similar to what Twitter and Facebook did to Trump after the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nMcCarthy’s spokesman, however, told the newspaper that the Republican leader “never said particular members should be removed from Twitter.”\n\nBiggs told OAN that the remark from McCarthy was “problematic.”\n\n“The third thing, and this is perhaps the most serious thing as well — I mean, all of these are serious — is that he is recorded as saying that if we supported Trump, that we should be removed from our social media platforms,” Biggs said.\n\nThe Arizona Republican said he wished McCarthy had been “honest and truthful” with the GOP conference at the time of the comments so they would not be an issue now, when the party is looking ahead to the midterms.\n\n“The unfortunate thing for us now is if he would have just been honest and truthful to us way back then, this would not be an issue today, and we don’t want it to be an issue because we don’t want it to be a distraction because we are moving forward … [with] tremendous momentum to retake the house,” he added.\n\nBiggs said he has “no reason to doubt” that McCarthy’s comments on the call were his “true intentions and feelings.”\n\nThe Hill reached out to McCarthy for comment.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/biggsandy_102121gn_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:52'}

But the report stops short of recommending direct financial reparations, and officials have no immediate plans for that kind of support.\n\nHarvard, the nation’s oldest and wealthiest college, is the latest among a growing number of U.S. schools attempting to confront their involvement with slavery and also make amends for it.\n\nThe report, commissioned by Bacow, found that Harvard’s faculty, staff and leaders enslaved more than 70 Black and Native American people from the school’s founding in 1636 to 1783. It cautions that the figure is “almost certainly an undercount.” Using historical records, researchers were able to identify dozens of enslaved people by name, along with their connection to the university.\n\nMost were identified only by a single name, such as Cesar, Dinah and Venus.\n\n“Enslaved men and women served Harvard presidents and professors and fed and cared for Harvard students,” researchers found. “Moreover, throughout this period and well into the 19th century, the University and its donors benefited from extensive financial ties to slavery.”\n\nThe report says the university “should make a significant monetary commitment, and it should invest in remedies of equal or greater breadth than other universities.” Bacow said Harvard will attempt to redress its wrongs through “teaching, research and service." He is creating a committee to implement the report\'s suggestions.\n\nBuilding on earlier research at Harvard, the report details how the university depended on the slave trade in its early years and profited from it for decades.\n\nHarvard invested directly in the sugar and rum trades in the Caribbean, along with the U.S. cotton and railroad industries. The college\'s early growth is credited to support from wealthy donors who accumulated their fortunes through the slave trade and industries that relied on it.\n\nAlong with the 70 people who were enslaved, the report also lists their enslavers — including several Harvard presidents and high-ranking officials — and the campus buildings, rooms and professorships that are still named after them.\n\nEven after slavery was abolished, the report says, prominent scholars continued to promote concepts that fueled racist ideas.\n\nIt cites work by 19th century professor Louis Agassiz, who pushed discredited theories on “race science” and eugenics. Another scholar led a “physical education” program that collected students’ physical measurements to support research advancing eugenic theories.\n\nIn his message, Bacow called the findings “disturbing and shocking,” and he acknowledged that the school “perpetuated practices that were profoundly immoral.”\n\n“Consequently, I believe we bear a moral responsibility to do what we can to address the persistent corrosive effects of those historical practices on individuals, on Harvard, and on our society,” he wrote.\n\nThe 130-page report included a series of recommendations that Bacow endorsed. The $100 million will be used to carry out the work, with some funding to be made available now and more to be held in an endowment. The university itself has an endowment of more than $50 billion, the largest in the nation.\n\nThe report says Harvard should identify the descendants of enslaved people and engage with them “through dialogue, programming, information sharing, relationship building and educational support.”\n\n“Through such efforts, these descendants can recover their histories, tell their stories and pursue empowering knowledge,” the report said.\n\nMore broadly, it urges Harvard to fight racial inequality by expanding education options for descendants of enslaved people, especially in the South and the Caribbean. It calls on the university to work closely with historically Black colleges across the country, with new funding to bring students and scholars to Harvard for up to a year at a time.\n\nAnd acknowledging the enslavement of Native Americans, it calls on Harvard to build closer ties with New England tribes. Harvard should recruit more students from tribal communities, the report says, and organize a national conference promoting research on the enslavement of Indigenous people.\n\nIn accepting the recommendations, Harvard joins an increasing number of colleges attempting to move from research to action as they reconcile with their histories.\n\nGeorgetown University in 2019 promised to raise $400,000 a year for the descendants of enslaved people sold by the school. The Princeton Theological Seminary created a $27.6 million reparative endowment. The University of Virginia established scholarships for the descendants of enslaved people.\n\nHarvard formally began exploring its ties to slavery in 2016, when former President Drew Gilpin Faust acknowledged that the school was “directly complicit in America’s system of racial bondage." Faust organized a committee to study the topic and had a plaque installed on campus honoring enslaved people who labored there.\n\nStudent activists had been shining a light on Harvard\'s darker histories for years. In 2015, students demanded that Harvard Law School abandon its official crest, which was tied to an 18th century donor whose family enslaved dozens of people. Months later, the school retired the symbol.\n\nSoon after becoming president, Bacow established a new Presidential Initiative on Harvard and the Legacy of Slavery to dig deeper into the university\'s role. That effort led to the new report.\n\n“The Harvard that I have known, while far from perfect, has always tried to be better — to bring our lived experience ever closer to our high ideals,” Bacow wrote. “In releasing this report and committing ourselves to following through on its recommendations, we continue a long tradition of embracing the challenges before us.”', 'image': '/static/img/wln_alt.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:14'}

The university also appointed a committee chaired by Martha Minow, former dean of Harvard Law School, to move recommendations into action and committed $100 million to fund its initiative.\n\n“The legacy of slavery, including the persistence of both overt and subtle discrimination against people of color, continues to influence the world in the form of disparities in education, health, wealth, income, social mobility, and almost any other metric we might use to measure equality,” Bacow said in a statement. “Consequently, I believe we bear a moral responsibility to do what we can to address the persistent corrosive effects of those historical practices on individuals, on Harvard, and on our society.”\n\nHarvard’s report revealed dozens of individuals — including five of the university’s previous presidents — enslaved African and Indigenous people, according to city vital records, wills and other documents.\n\nIn recent years, several other colleges have started reckoning with their ties to slavery and indentured servitude. The University of Mississippi and Georgetown University revealed that they benefited from slave labor, while Brown University students voted in March 2021 for the institution to offer reparations to descendants of enslaved laborers. Columbia University also publicly marked its ties to slavery by adding historical markers to four of its residence halls, including Furnald Hall — which was home to Frederick Wells, the first Black student to live on campus and who was harassed by Ku Klux Klan members.\n\nWhile reviewing Harvard’s history of slavery may be troubling, Bacow said, he strongly encouraged all students, faculty and other members of the university community to read the report.\n\n“Many of you will find it disturbing and even shocking,” Bacow said. “Many of you may also be disappointed in learning painful truths about the history of an institution that you have come to know, respect, and even love.

Cruz is continuing to stump for Mandel even after Trump later gave his coveted endorsement to former writer and venture capitalist J.D. Vance. Following the caustic 2016 election, Cruz became a staunch ally of Trump, raising questions why the Texas Republican is bucking the former president in the key race.\n\nCruz earlier this month endorsed Mandel, a Marine and former state treasurer. A social conservative who remains popular among evangelical Christians, Cruz said in a statement announcing the endorsement that Mandel checked all the right boxes, calling him "a proven fighter for our American way of life, a champion for the unborn, and a stalwart advocate for our religious liberties."\n\nMandel touted the endorsement in his own statement, saying his campaign has the backing of more than 100 faith leaders, as well as the National Association for Gun Rights, Ohio Value Voters and Right to Life Action Coalition of Ohio.\n\nOver the weekend, the two are scheduled to campaign in Ohio churches, which have been key for Mandel\'s campaign.\n\n"I\'m sidestepping all of the Republican Party groups and, instead, I\'m running a campaign through churches," Mandel told KSAT, which reported that his campaign has prominently featured Christian imagery, despite the candidate\'s Jewish faith.\n\nJon Morrow, chief executive officer of the conservative Committee for a Better Ohio, told Newsweek that Cruz "has always been a very staunch advocate of Israel" and Mandel has close ties to pro-Israel Christian groups. "There\'s a lot of relationship that\'s been built between Ted Cruz and Josh," he said.\n\nMike Gonidakis, president of Ohio Right to Life, told Newsweek that Cruz "read the tea leaves" when he earlier endorsed Mandel in the crowded field. He said Mandel seemed like a "winner" at the time, but a Fox News poll released Tuesday shows Vance has pulled ahead slightly, with 23 percent support of those surveyed. Mandel is second with 22 percent.\n\nGonidakis said he suspects Cruz still aspires to run for president and backing Mandel will help secure support in a crucial state like Ohio.\n\n"They\'re going on a church tour, which is a very conservative base and very loyal too," said Gonidakis. "He is definitely earning support of voters with this tour with Josh Mandel."\n\nElsewhere, Cruz has endorsed businessman David McCormick in Pennsylvania\'s Senate Republican primary (Trump has endorsed television personality Mehmet Oz).\n\nAt the moment, Trump hasn\'t attacked Cruz for backing a different candidate. But Donald Trump Jr. appears to have taken a veiled swipe. Mandel has been endorsed by the conservative Club for Growth, which has previously backed Cruz. Last week, Trump Jr. posted an ad attacking Mandel, calling him "the Club for Chinese Growth backed establishment candidate."\n\nWhile Cruz has a following among the Republican base in Ohio, Gonidakis (whose group earlier endorsed Vance) said that Trump has more pull after carrying the state twice.\n\n"When it comes down to the popularity contest, I\'m not sure an endorsement by an elected official other than President Trump would move the needle significantly," he said.\n\nNewsweek has reached out to Trump for comment.', 'image': 'https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2026589/ted-cruz-donald-trump.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:08'}

Church autonomy\'s defenders have sometimes described the doctrine as establishing distinct spheres of sovereignty for church and state. But critics have argued that church autonomy puts religious institutions above the law. They contend that church autonomy doctrine lacks limiting principles and worry that the "sphere sovereignty" theory of church and state leaves no room for accountability for wrongdoing in religious institutions. The courts, for their part, have recognized that church autonomy must have limits but have struggled to articulate them, leaving the case law in a state of ferment.\n\nThis article makes the case that, contrary to the critics, church autonomy is limited by an accountability principle, itself resting on the same bases that have been used to defend the most robust version of church autonomy. First, the social pluralist theory of sphere sovereignty does not just defend a place for religious institutions to exercise their own self-governance over religious matters; it also has an important place for the state to hold wrongdoers accountable for civil harms. Second, the deep history of church-state relations that has shaped the pro-church autonomy caselaw and scholarship alike also has rich resources to defend a principle of accountability.\n\nAfter presenting the theoretical case for the coexistence of autonomy and accountability principles, this article presents a doctrinal roadmap for how courts can locate the limits of church autonomy. Drawing on doctrinal elements already present in the case law, the approach outlined here can be applied to provide accountability and limit church autonomy in key cases—and it can be done without contradicting any existing Supreme Court doctrine.', 'image': 'https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2021/11/the-volokh-conspiracy.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:50'}

I have a new paper (forthcoming in the Notre Dame Law Review) about the limits of the church autonomy doctrine—responding, in part, to areas of confusion that have arisen in lower courts applying church autonomy doctrine. I\'ll use some future blog posts this week to get into those issues. Before getting into that, I want to step back to reflect on what\'s going on in the field of "church autonomy doctrine" and how this issue has risen in significance in the last decade.\n\nThe "church autonomy doctrine" is a legal principle of protection for the internal self-governance of religious organizations. (You can find a longer version of this explanation, with more citations, in the law review article.) Church autonomy doctrine protects religious institutions from state control, ensuring that religious organizations can control their own beliefs and internal affairs, or ensuring that the state does not establish a religion. The basics are fairly intuitive: Americans don\'t want the state telling religious bodies whom it can or can\'t retain as a minister, rabbi, or imam, or endorsing the theological distinctives of one side of a church split when the competing factions disagree about what counts as the "true" form of a given faith.\n\nThe church autonomy doctrine applies to all religious institutions, not just churches. While it could be termed "religious autonomy" (or more precisely, autonomy for religious institutions), "church autonomy" remains the most used term in the courts for the body of law that has developed about the internal affairs of religious organizations.\n\nThe church autonomy doctrine is based on both of the religion clauses of the First Amendment. The courts have based church autonomy on both religion clauses of the First Amendment. Interfering with the internal governance of a religious institution would violate religious liberty (free exercise) and establish a religion by allowing the state to dictate the conduct of the religious body. Scholars disagree about whether the Establishment Clause or the Free Exercise Clause provides the better foundation, or whether it is best to view church autonomy as the combined effect of the religion clauses, as the Supreme Court has said. But in any case, church autonomy ensures the institutional separation of church and state.\n\nBroadly speaking, this doctrine has two main applications. First, courts should not decide matters that require a particular position on religious doctrine or belief. So if the court is asked to decide whether a member was wrongfully expelled on the basis of the church\'s doctrinal standards, the court should decline. Second, courts should not decide matters that interfere with the religious institution\'s internal governance. As the Supreme Court said in its 2019 decision of Our Lady of Guadalupe School, this "protect[s] their autonomy with respect to internal management decisions that are essential to the institution\'s central mission." This includes selecting ministers, which is known as the "ministerial exception" from employment nondiscrimination law. It also has been long understood to protect churches from defamation lawsuits challenging church discipline proceedings.\n\nSome courts and commentators speak as though there are several different but related doctrines here (church autonomy different from ministerial exception different from ecclesiastical abstention). But I think the better way to think of this is as a single overarching principle—church autonomy—applied in different contexts. That\'s certainly how the Supreme Court has described the issue.\n\nChurch autonomy is not new. One can find a common-law church autonomy principle being articulated by the Supreme Court as early as 1872, even before the First Amendment was applied against the states. (The early history of American church autonomy is fascinating, but I\'ll hold back on that for the present—that\'s the subject of another project I have underway!) Church autonomy principles were thoroughly constitutionalized (that is, articulated as a matter of constitutional law) in a 1952 decision.\n\nBut for a long time, church autonomy remained a backwater. The paradigmatic Free Exercise religious liberty case involved an individual seeking to follow the dictates of individual conscience. The paradigm cases for Establishment Clause principles were government religious practices—school prayer, Ten Commandments in government buildings, and the like.\n\nI first became interested in church autonomy cases when I was in college. My friend Bob Renaud and I noticed that the church autonomy cases engaged with church-state issues that had been historically very important in the history of Christian theology, about the formal institutional authority of church and state. We wrote an article about this. (It was my first law review publication—still in college and not quite knowing how law reviews worked, I was grateful to the law review editors who took a chance on us!) As I finished college, worked, came back to graduate school, and pursued other projects, I kept an eye on church autonomy. And over time, it took on more and more importance.\n\nOver the last decade, most of the Supreme Court\'s high-profile cases about religious liberty involved religious institutions, from church employment decisions in Hosanna Tabor, to corporate conscience in Hobby Lobby, to religious social services in Fulton. The idea that the solitary individual conscience was the paradigm case for First Amendment religion cases has shifted considerably over the last decade.\n\nThe Supreme Court addressed church autonomy issues for the first time in years in Hosanna Tabor, making the church autonomy principle as strong as it has ever been. While controversies swirled over the best way to interpret and apply the Free Exercise clause to conscience claims, religious institutions had robust legal protections for their domain of internal autonomy. Zoë Robinson has perceptively called this decade an era of "religious institutionalism."\n\nChurch autonomy is no longer a backwater. It has taken its place as one of the central Religion Clause doctrines, regularly litigated in the courts. But with that as the case, it\'s particularly important to reflect on the scope and limits of church autonomy. Is church autonomy a praiseworthy principle of religious liberty that appropriately recognizes the communal nature of so much religious faith and practice? Or does it threaten (as its critics charge) to place religious institutions above the law in troubling ways? That\'s a question I\'ll take up in the next post.', 'image': 'https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2021/11/the-volokh-conspiracy.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:36'}

My first post (here) introduces the idea of church autonomy. At a high level of generality, church autonomy principles are well settled in the caselaw. And for a core of church autonomy issues (such as the "ministerial exception" cases regarding the employment of ministers), the structure of analysis is increasingly sophisticated.\n\nBut there remain a considerable array of issues that are unsettled and hotly debated. The one I want to focus on here is the search for subject matter limits on church autonomy. Courts recognize the value of church autonomy protections for religious institutions but also recognize that not everything done by or within a religious institution can be protected. Yet courts so far have struggled to articulate the limits of church autonomy.\n\nChurch autonomy usually functions as a defense to legal claims asserted against religious institutions. The courts widely share a sensible intuition that crimes and some subset of torts are not generally subject to a church-autonomy defense. As the Second Circuit put it, "The minister struck on the head by a falling gargoyle as he is about to enter the church may have an actionable claim"—that is, a claim not subject to church-autonomy defenses. But at the same time, the courts agree that there is a set of torts—notably defamation—that can be defeated by a church autonomy defense. The courts have yet to supply a clear dividing line between those tort (and tort-like) matters that are covered by church autonomy and those that are not.\n\nIn cases that held that church-autonomy principles precluded a claim based on hostile workplace under the antidiscrimination rules of Title VII, the courts have sometimes said that there need be no concern that this holding would prevent future tort claims. The Supreme Court too said that its ministerial-exception case, Hosanna-Tabor, was not deciding whether, or to what extent, church autonomy protected religious institutions from claims based on tort or contract.\n\nBut if church autonomy did not protect churches from any tort claims, the court would be discarding a substantial body of cases protecting churches from defamation claims arising out of church discipline proceedings. On the other hand, if churches are protected from all tort claims, then that leads to the troubling possibility that churches are immune from civil accountability for even the heinous cases of abuse or harassment taking place under a church\'s watch.\n\nSo far, this has been mostly a theoretical possibility. It\'s rare that this has come up, for religious institutions often simply refrain from raising church autonomy as a defense in situations involving direct clergy wrongdoing. Churches may recognize on principle that whatever misconduct was at issue was not in fact pursued as part of the church\'s governance. But even where religious institutions do not try to use a church autonomy defense, critics still understandably worry that church autonomy could be used to shield serious misconduct.\n\nThe courts do have resources to articulate limits for church autonomy, as I\'ll explain in a future post. But they have sometimes pursued approaches that are misguided or confusing.\n\nAcross all of the current approaches, there\'s the problem of simple unpredictability. There has been considerable variation in the approaches courts adopt for articulating limits to church autonomy. And it\'s hard to know which doctrinal tools a given court will adopt in any particular case.\n\nMore specifically, some approaches being employed by lower courts are in tension with the Supreme Court\'s precedents or inconsistent with the purposes of church-autonomy doctrine. Take a few examples (and check out my law review article for an extended analysis):\n\nNeutral Principles:\n\nOne approach is to ask whether a given dispute can be resolved with "neutral principles" of law. The problem is that this approach is sometimes applied in ways that conflict with the Supreme Court\'s approach or are simply incompatible with the continued application of the church autonomy doctrine.\n\nIf the court simply asks whether "neutral principles" can resolve a case, the answer will (almost) always be yes. Unless the law targets or discriminates against religion, the law itself will be neutral. As I explain in detail in the paper, this use of neutral principles confuses rather different uses of the concept from different lines of cases. And it is working on a fundamentally different problem than that addressed by the church autonomy principle, which is the idea that the internal affairs of the church are off-limits to civil government. The classic instances of church autonomy protection can appear as exemptions from neutral laws. Defamation law gives way when a church is exercising discipline over a member. Antidiscrimination law gives way to a religious body\'s right to choose its own clergy. Neutral principles in this form do not provide an outer limit for church autonomy. They eliminate church autonomy.\n\nMatters of Religious Doctrine Required to Trigger Church Autonomy:\n\nSome courts seem to assert that religious autonomy is applied only when religious doctrinal issues would be implicated by a court deciding the matter. But if taken literally, this would be flatly inconsistent with the Supreme Court\'s repeated holdings in the ministerial-exception cases to the effect that the harm of adjudicating internal affairs of a religious organization does not depend on whether the particular issue was based on religious convictions.\n\nA broad statement that church autonomy doctrine applies only when the issue is religious just assumes the central issue: is church governance inherently religious? Maybe the answer is yes, but the courts have been less than clear about it. And if it is so, this would solve one question but raise another: Is a religious institution just automatically exempt whenever it claims that something happening within its community is a matter of internal governance? Surely that cannot be right, especially if we entertain the possibility of unusual or extremist religions that embrace violence.\n\nMembership\n\nAnother possible way of limiting the scope of the church governance form of church autonomy is to focus on church membership. For at least some claims, courts have said that churches could be liable (that is, not protected by church autonomy) for conduct regarding non-members, but not liable if the same conduct was directed at members.\n\nYet it cannot be the case that a lack of formal membership divests the church of autonomy protections. Some scholars suggest distilling church autonomy to constructive consent. Still, no court has been willing make consent or association the sole basis of the doctrine. Consent is part of the rationale in the cases, but not the whole of it. Yet exactly how much can be resolved through consent—looking at who is a member of the church, for instance—is still poorly explained in the cases.\n\nIn the next post, I\'ll turn to consider better ways to articulate the limits of church autonomy.', 'image': 'https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2021/11/the-volokh-conspiracy.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:52'}

Too much of a risk.”\n\nLater in the day, outside the closed ride in Orlando\'s tourist district, the teen\'s father, Yarnell Sampson, said he wanted the people responsible to be held accountable. Before addressing reporters, he walked by a makeshift memorial of flowers and signs to honor his son and wiped away tears.\n\n“When I found out it was my child, it took the breath out of me. It took some life out of me as well,” Sampson said.\n\nThe parents filed a lawsuit in state court in Orlando on Monday against the ride\'s owner, manufacturer and landlord, claiming they were negligent and failed to provide a safe amusement ride.\n\nThe lawsuit claims the defendants failed to warn Sampson, who was 6-foot-2-inches (188 centimeters) tall and weighed 380 pounds (172-kilograms), about the risks of someone of his size going on the ride. It also claims they did not provide an appropriate restraint system.\n\nMichael Haggard, one of Dodd\'s attorneys, held up a seatbelt strap that he said costs $22. While most free-fall rides have a shoulder harness and a seatbelt, the Orlando Free Fall ride had only an over-the-shoulder harness. Adding seatbelts to the ride\'s 30 seats would have cost $660, the lawsuit said.\n\n“It\'s disgusting,” Dodd said. “You wanted to save a dollar but you stripped me of my son.”\n\nAttorney Benjamin Crump, who also is representing the teen’s family, said at the Orlando news conference that the teens\' parents were seeking millions of dollars. Another attorney, Bob Hilliard, said among the witnesses they want to testify is someone who was on the ride before Tyre Sampson, who “has a story to tell." Hilliard didn\'t elaborate further.\n\nAn attorney for the ride’s owner, Orlando Slingshot, said the company was cooperating with state investigators.\n\n“We reiterate that all protocols, procedures and safety measures provided by the manufacturer of the ride were followed,” attorney Trevor Arnold said in an emailed statement.\n\nA spokesperson for the landlord, ICON Park, did not comment on the lawsuit.\n\nLast week, an initial report by outside engineers hired by the Florida Department of Agriculture said sensors on the ride had been adjusted manually to double the size of the opening for restraints on two seats, resulting in Sampson not being properly secured before he slipped out and fell to his death.\n\nThe Orlando Free Fall ride, which is taller than the Statue of Liberty, did not experience any electrical or mechanical failures, the report said.\n\nThe report said there were many other “potential contributions” to the accident and that a full review of the ride’s design and operations was needed.\n\nSampson, visiting Orlando for spring break from the St. Louis area, was killed March 24. Dodd said she was devastated when one of Tyre’s friends called to tell her what happened, knowing she couldn’t be there for her son.\n\n“He was a go-getter,” Dodd said. “He was on his way. He was going to be known — but not like this.”\n\nHis father described Tyre as a “gentle giant," who said “ma\'am and sir" to adults.\n\n“A child shouldn\'t lose his life trying to have fun," Yarnell Sampson said.\n\n———\n\nAssociated Press reporter Mike Schneider in Orlando, Florida, contributed to this report.\n\n———\n\nFollow Mike Schneider on Twitter at https://twitter.com/MikeSchneiderAP.', 'image': '/static/img/wln_alt.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:28'}

There are examples where you could tell a pretty clear story that this made a major difference.”\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said, “We are regularly providing detailed, timely intelligence to the Ukrainians on the battlefield to help them defend their country against Russian aggression and will continue to do so.”\n\nNBC News is withholding some specific details that the network confirmed about the intelligence sharing at the request of U.S. military and intelligence officials, who say reporting on it could help the Russians shut down important sources of information.\n\n“There has been a lot of real-time intelligence shared in terms of things that could be used for specific targeting of Russian forces,” said a former senior intelligence official familiar with the situation. The information includes commercial satellite images “but also a lot of other intelligence about, for example, where certain types of Russian units are active.”\n\nUkraine continues to move air defenses and aircraft nearly every day with the help of American intelligence, which is one reason Russia has not been able to establish air dominance. In some cases, Ukraine moved the targeted air defense systems or planes just in time, the officials said.\n\n“The Russian military has literally been cratering empty fields where air defenses were once set up,” one U.S. official said. “It has had an enormous impact on the Russian military’s ability on the ground.”\n\nWhile U.S.-Ukrainian cooperation had been building since Russia seized Crimea in 2014, the Biden administration shifted into high gear in the weeks before the Russian invasion, when a U.S. military team visited to assess the state of Ukraine’s air defenses. The Americans provided Ukraine with detailed advice about how to disperse their air defense systems, a move that U.S. officials say helped Ukraine prevent Russia from seizing control of the skies.\n\nOnce the invasion got underway, lawyers in the U.S. defense and intelligence bureaucracy imposed guidance that in some cases limited the sharing of targeting information that could enable lethal Ukrainian strikes against Russians. But as Russia’s aggression has deepened, and under pressure from Congress, all of those impediments have been removed, officials say.\n\nEarlier this month, for example, the director of National Intelligence withdrew and replaced a memo that prohibited intelligence sharing for the purposes of regaining captured territory or aiding Ukrainian strikes in Crimea or the Donbas, officials said. NBC News was first to report on the expanded sharing.\n\nIntel has helped Ukraine defend, and also attack\n\nEven before the change, the U.S. had provided Ukraine with timely information enabling it to better target Russian forces.\n\nUkrainian forces have used specific coordinates shared by the U.S. to direct fire on Russian positions and aircraft, current and former officials tell NBC News.\n\nThose early shoot-downs helped thwart the Russian air assault operation designed to take Hostomel Airport near Kyiv, which would have allowed the Russians to flood troops and equipment to the region around the capital. The Russians eventually took the airport for a time, but never had enough control to fly in massive amounts of equipment. That failure had a significant impact on the battle for Kyiv, U.S. officials say.\n\nThe CIA is also devoting significant resources, current and former officials say, to gathering intelligence with the aim of protecting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whom the Russians want to kill. The agency is consulting with the Ukrainians on “how best to move him around, making sure that he’s not co-located with his entire chain of command, things like that,” a U.S. official said.\n\n“I would say where we are at is revolutionary in terms of what we have been able to do,” Army Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, told Congress last month in describing the sharing of information and intelligence between the U.S. and Ukraine.\n\nCIA Director William Burns told Congress last month that when he met with Zelenskyy in Kiev in January, “We shared with him intelligence we had at the time about some of the most graphic and concerning details of Russian planning about Kyiv as well and we’ve continued to do that every day since then.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki said last month that the U.S. has shared “a significant amount of detailed timely intelligence on Russia’s plans and activities with the Ukrainian government to help Ukrainians defend themselves,” adding that the material “includes information that should help them inform and develop their military response to Russia’s invasion, that’s what’s happening — or has been happening.”\n\nThe U.S. military and the CIA began seeking to deepen their relationships with Ukrainian counterparts after Russia seized Crimea in 2014. The CIA first helped Ukrainian services root out Russian spies, the former senior official said, and then provided training and guidance. The U.S. military also trained Ukrainian soldiers.\n\nUkrainian soldiers walk on a destroyed bridge in Irpin, on the outskirts of Kyiv, last week.

It would be along the lines of, ‘Here’s what we know — it doesn’t matter how we know it.’”\n\nOne Western intelligence official noted that it’s not only the intelligence that has proven decisive — it’s the performance of the Ukrainians in using it. The source said Ukrainians have fought the Russians with agility and courage, and when they have received actionable intelligence, they have moved with astonishing speed.\n\nMcLaughlin said the Ukrainians have made clever use of so-called open-source intelligence — commercial satellite imagery and intercepts of Russians talking openly on unencrypted radios.\n\n“The fact that there is so much open source [intelligence] available means that those collecting classified intelligence can focus on the things that are really hard and not publicly available.”\n\nAs the Ukrainian government sees it, intelligence sharing has improved, a source familiar with the government’s view told NBC News. That’s as far as he would go.\n\n“It’s gotten better,” he said.', 'image': 'https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2022-04/220426-ukraine-serviceman-mjf-1021-c76a80.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:51'}

I'll go to that district the next day and see exactly what is happening.\n\n'Send me a shot. New Yorkers, you see that send me a photo and I will be at that station.'\n\nThe mayor said that if New Yorkers send him photos of officers on their phones, he will be at that district the next day to 'see exactly what's happening'\n\nImages of NYPD cops using their phones while on duty have infuriated New Yorkers as the city battles an exponential rise in violent crime\n\nAdams said that New Yorkers can look forward to a 'visible difference in policing in the next couple of weeks.'\n\nHe spoke a fortnight after a gunman shot five people on a Brooklyn subway train, with numerous other horrifying crimes raising fears for commuters' safety.\n\nThey include Deloitte manager Michelle Go, who was killed by a vagrant after being shoved off a subway platform at Times Square station and into the path of a moving train January.\n\nTaking photos or videos of officers comes could come with limitations. In March 2022, Adams slammed members of the public who got too close when recording officers who were making arrests.\n\nAdams said at the time, 'Stop being on top of my police officers while they carry on their jobs; not acceptable and won’t be tolerated. If your iPhone can’t catch that picture at a safe distance then you need to upgrade your iPhone.'\n\nAdams struck a different note in March 2022 when he slammed members of the public who got too close to officers when they were making arrests\n\nEarlier in his April 26 speech, Adams took aim at the rising crime rates in the city.\n\n'New Yorkers have a right to be angry, a right to expect more — to feel safe, to be safe, to know that your city is looking out for you, your family, and those in need,' Adams said in his speech after his first 100 days in office have been plagued by skyrocketing crime.\n\nThe former New York City police captain took office this year with a central focus on making the city feel safe and trying to return it to some sense of normalcy post-pandemic.\n\nHis speech came after Adams finalized his nearly $100 billion budget, which earmarked millions toward mental health and building affordable housing but did not designate money to hire more cops.\n\nFelony assaults are up 21 percent than at the same time in 2021, robbery is up nearly 47 percent, rape is up nearly 15 percent, and the percentage of shooting victims is up eight percent, according to the latest statistics from the city's police department. Murders are down just 13 percent.\n\nThe mayor pointed out that hate crimes continue to be directed at Asian, Muslim, Jewish, Sikh, and LGBTQ+ New Yorkers.\n\n'Our sister Michelle Go was pushed to her death in front of a train in an act of horrifying hatred,' he said, adding that dozens more of 'our New York City neighbors' have been killed by gun violence.\n\nAdams named several of the victims, including an aspiring rapper who was executed in cold blood, a 19-year-old girl was killed as she worked the night shift in East Harlem and two police officers who were shot dead responding to a call.\n\n'Their names will echo in our hearts forever: Kristal, Jayquan, Kade, Sally, Angellyah. Detectives Wilbert Mora and Jason Rivera,' he said, pointing out that many of the victims' families were at the speech on Tuesday.\n\n'I can only imagine the loss you feel and the pain you live with,' he told them. 'But I will not rest until we have addressed the conditions that led to that loss. We will do what is necessary to make all of our communities safe. You have my word, as a former police officer, a fellow New Yorker, and your mayor.'\n\nAdams took office this year with a central focus on making the city feel safe, but violent crime rates have climbed since the pandemic, according to crime stats (pictured)\n\nThe mayor's speech was full of hope and promises on Tuesday, but the first 3 1/2 months of his administration have been beset by a string of high-profile violent incidents, with last week's shooting on a subway train the most terrifying and public of all.\n\nThe morning rush-hour attack, in which 10 people were shot on a system that serves as the arteries of New York, complicates Adams' push to address crime and persuade people that the city of nearly 9 million is safe. It also occurred amid a broader, multi-year debate about policing and crime, and how the city should respond.\n\nThe mayor has been among Democrats who've pushed back on calls from liberals to cut police budgets and instead route resources to social services, and he has sought to bring back some controversial policing tactics, saying they can be employed as useful tools without a return to past abuses.\n\nIn his speech at Brooklyn's Kings Theatre, Adams unveiled a $99.7 billion revised budget plan, with much of the money geared toward homeless services, mental health programs, affordable housing and education.\n\n'There are four main areas that we will focus on as we go forward: protecting our people, growing our economy, uplifting our youth, and building our infrastructure,' he said, adding that the new budget reflects those values and provides for them.\n\nThe budget also includes funding for a ‘Blueprint to End Gun Violence,’ a 'plan to confront increased crime with strategic focus and realistic solutions.'\n\n'The plan ensures the NYPD is laser-focused on apprehending the small number of individuals responsible for the majority of gun trafficking and shootings in our city,' he said.\n\nIn partnership with President Biden, Governor Hochul, and law enforcement agencies at the local, state, and federal levels, Adams said they are working to 'cut off the flow of illegal guns into our city and crack down on repeat offenders.'\n\nThe budget includes $55 million to expand the B-HEARD program, which stands for Behavioral Health Emergency Assistance Response Division. The program is comprised of EMTs and mental health professionals that respond to 911 calls involving mental health issues.\n\nAdams also detailed that things that have been accomplished in his first 100 days - highlighting that they have taken nearly 2,300 guns off the street.\n\n'We have added more than 50,000 jobs in the first three months of this year, significantly outpacing the national average,' he said, adding that the unemployment rate dropped to 6.5 percent in March, down from 7.4 percent in December 2021.\n\nAdams also said that hotel room demand is now at 86 percent of pre-pandemic levels, up from 63 percent in January of this year.\n\n'We have ensured more than 97 percent of adults in New York City have had at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine,' he said. 'Ninety-seven percent — that’s a number to be proud of.'\n\nAdams said school attendance had increased by nearly 70 percent and there continues to be low levels of COVID reported in schools.\n\n'We have added nearly 1,000 new beds for homeless New Yorkers, moved 2,500 families into shelter, and placed another 2,700 New Yorkers into subsidized housing,' he concluded.\n\n'But this is only the start of our efforts to revitalize and rebuild this city,' he said.\n\nSince Adams took office Jan. 1, he's been speaking about policing and crime frequently, as the list of frightening incidents piled up quickly.\n\nThe city saw a rash of random shootings, the killing of two police officers and attacks that included a woman - Michelle Go - shoved to her death in front of a train by a stranger.\n\nMichelle Go, 40, was died after being pushed by Martial Simon, 61, who is homeless\n\nNYC Mayor Eric Adams, 61, spoke at her vigil (pictured) and said the city couldn't go back to being filled with violent crime. Crime has only continued to rise since Go's death\n\n'This has been particularly brutal. And I feel for him. I think he´s done a fine job, especially as he´s just getting used to it,' said Adams´ predecessor and fellow Democrat, Bill de Blasio.\n\nMost of the violence the city has experienced has not been in the subways but in neighborhoods, particularly in communities of color. But attacks on the subway, a vital sprawling network millions of New Yorkers rely upon, loom large in public perceptions of safety.\n\nAdams rode the subway to City Hall on his first day as mayor, calling 911 to report a fight near the train platform before he even boarded the train. He admitted later that he didn´t feel safe on the train after encountering a yelling passenger and several homeless people, and said the city needs to tackle 'actual crime' and 'the perception of crime.'\n\nAdams had already announced plans earlier this year to boost the number of police officers on subway platforms and trains and to address crime generally. He has brought back a controversial police anti-gun unit, called for help from the federal government cracking down on ghost guns and pushed for changes to New York´s bail laws.\n\nCritics contend that focusing just on beefing up police isn´t a solution to making the city safe, but more investment is needed in mental health programs and other social services.\n\nJayquan McKenley, 18, who went by the name Chii Wvttz, was shot dead outside a recording studio in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood earlier this year\n\nGrowing up, drill rapper Jayquan McKenley, 18, went to five different high schools and programs as a teenager missed hundreds of days of school\n\nFrank James, the 62-year-old suspect in the Brooklyn subway shooting, spoke of his own mental health struggles in a series of YouTube videos in which he described going in and out of mental health facilities, including some in New York City.\n\nBefore Tuesday´s attack, Adams had started sending out social work teams to try to connect people on the streets with mental health help and other services. The mayor also announced plans to significantly expand a summer youth job program designed to put young people in paid jobs when school is on break, with the aim of diverting them from activities that could lead to arrest or violence.\n\nAfter last week´s subway shooting, Adams, in a series of interviews, discussed plans to increase the number of police officers patrolling the subways and suggested metal detectors could be installed in stations - a decision that ultimately would rest with the transit authority, which falls under state control.\n\nFrank James, the 62-year-old suspect in the Brooklyn subway shooting, spoke of his own mental health struggles in a series of YouTube videos\n\nFrantic commuters were seen trying to run for the exits after a gunman opened fire at a Brooklyn subway station on Tuesday morning\n\nDanny Pearlstein, a spokesman for the nonprofit Riders Alliance representing New York City bus and subway passengers, said that despite a high-profile incident like the shooting, the subway is still the safest way to get around the city, with traffic accidents and pedestrians being struck by cars a far more likely hazard.\n\nRather than explore metal detectors and other ways to scrutinize passengers, he said New York needs a better transit system overall that gets more people on board and provides safety with strength in numbers.\n\n'By having transit that is faster and more reliable and gets to more places that people want to go is a way to boost ridership,' he said.\n\nDe Blasio praised Adams´ attempts to address both crime and perceptions of crime, and said public safety experts recommend the best way to make the city feel safe is 'more normalcy, more recovery from COVID.'\n\nGetting people back on trains and back in the city is not just a reminder of New York's resiliency, but also an added layer of eyes and ears to compliment the police, the former mayor said.\n\nAmong this year's dead are NYPD cops Jason Rivera, left, and Wilbert Mora, right, who were both shot and killed by a suspect in January\n\n'The overall reality is NYPD has actually done a very good job over the years of making the subway safer and safer,' he said. 'Police can do so much, but they can´t do it alone. They need eyes and ears - and cooperation of the public.'\n\nFormer City Council Speaker Christine Quinn said it's difficult to have a discussion about how to prevent Tuesday's shooting without knowing more about the alleged perpetrator and his motivation and mental health, and that makes it difficult to link it to a broader examination of other violent crime in New York.\n\n'One of the challenges with crime is you can get three people shot in one night and they´re all shot for different reasons that have different solutions and different responses,' Quinn said.\n\nShe said Adams, with his law enforcement background, understands that crime and criminals are not one-size-fits-all. And while guns may be involved in a lot of crimes and more illegal guns need to be taken off the street, other incidents can stem from gang issues, mental health issues or other factors.\n\nConfronting crime generally requires a multi-faceted response, she said, and help from many layers of government.\n\n'There are very few things that one elected official can fix alone,' she said. 'Even in a big city like New York, a lot of what exists here is also controlled by the state and the feds.'\n\n'But there is no bigger bully pulpit and convening power-short of the president of the United States-than that of the mayor of the city of New York. And we know Eric Adams is not afraid to use that,' she said.", 'image': 'https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/27/01/57090589-0-image-a-21_1651018811714.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:58'}

So she\'s watching over us.\' Advertisement\n\n\'And it’s at the hands of some of these same people that Harry experienced some of his darkest and most distressing moments as a working member of the Firm\'.\n\nHarry is known to have an historical hatred for the so-called ‘men in grey suits’, the senior courtiers who advise the Queen, such as her private secretary Sir Edward Young, whom he believes has deliberately kept him at arm’s length.\n\nMr Scobie: \'I remember how my jaw dropped when a friend of the couple gave me a play-by-play account of how the Queen’s private secretary, Edward Young, went out of his way to prevent the couple from visiting the monarch in Sandringham\'.\n\nBut the Queen is also surrounded a tight-knit and intensely devoted circle of mostly long-standing servants.\n\nThey are led by Miss Kelly, a former dresser promoted to the special position of ‘personal assistant, advisor and curator’ to the Queen, who is so close to her boss that she wears in her shoes and revels in her position as her gatekeeper.\n\nHarry famously fell out with the Liverpool docker’s daughter over Meghan’s choice of tiara for their wedding.\n\nHe accused Miss Kelly of being deliberately obstructive towards his fiancée, while supporters of the royal right-hand woman say the Queen’s grandson was rude and short-tempered, effectively telling her: ‘What Meghan wants, Meghan gets.’\n\nWriting about the aides Scobie said: \'Angela Kelly, who multiple sources told me made it almost impossible for Meghan to have a necessary “hair trial” with her chosen wedding tiara—even standing up the duchess-to-be and her hairstylist, who had flown in especially, at a pre-scheduled fitting. Harry, sources said, felt it was a cruel attempt to put his partner “in her place”.\'\n\nMeghan returned with Harry for less than 24 hours for the first time in more than two years, staying at Frogmore Cottage, the home they have kept on the Queen’s Windsor estate.\n\nHarry and Meghan arrived in Britain after an overnight British Airways flight from Los Angeles. They did not bring their children, Archie, two, and ten-month-old Lilibet – who the Queen has still not met.\n\nThey were driven to Frogmore where they spent the night. After his failure to attend his grandfather’s memorial service last month – amid an ongoing legal row with the Home Office over the removal of his police protection – Harry’s offer to visit the Queen was being viewed as an olive branch.\n\nBut the Duke of Sussex upset palace officials and reportedly his father and brother after claiming part of his visit was motivated by \'making sure she’s protected and got the right people around her.’\n\nHarry went on to claim that the Queen tells him things she feels she cannot tell anyone else.\n\nHe said: ‘We have a really special relationship. We talk about things that she can’t talk about with anybody else. So that’s always a nice piece to it.’\n\nHarry and Meghan may come to a \'commuter\' arrangement with the Royal Family after the Queen dies, a royal author has claimed\n\nMeghan would not want to return to the UK for more than a fleeting visit if Harry mends his relationship with his father and brother because \'she disliked England\', the former editor of Vanity Fair has claimed.\n\nMs Brown also noted that the couple\'s exit from royal life was a \'disaster all round\'\n\nTina Brown has said she believes Prince Harry may even want to make a sensational return to the Royal Family after the Queen\'s death - splitting his time between Britain and the US - though Meghan would be unlikely to be fully on board.\n\nMs Brown has described Megxit as a \'disaster for both sides\' and claimed Harry and Meghan caused \'maximum mayhem\' when leaving the Royal Family because they are \'addicted to drama\'.\n\nShe said: \'I think that Harry is going to want to come back when the Queen dies to serve his country. And I think they will find a way to reel him in. And it’s possible that Meghan - maybe they will have a commuter arrangement. I don’t know. I don’t see Meghan ever wanting to go back. She disliked England.\'\n\nMs Brown claimed that the British public are \'very very sad\' about Megxit, because they took Harry to their hearts and also tried to support him when he found love with Meghan. Ms Brown also labelled Prince Harry a \'very impetuous man\' and revealed how Palace advisors \'always thought he would leave\'.\n\nShe said: \'I actually think there is a Harry-shaped hole in the royal family now. And Harry was beloved, actually, by the British people. And people adored Meghan when she came into the mix.\n\n\'So it was actually very, very sad for everybody that it went so wrong because they actually need Harry and Meghan now. You should see, the Queen is failing, and she’s very frail. They kind of need Harry and Meghan to bring that star power and to be on the balcony at the Jubilee. We have to have a royal family up there. We can’t have Andrew up there.\'\n\nThe Queen and Prince Charles are said to be \'keen\' to welcome Harry and Meghan (pictured during Trooping The Colour 2018) to \'family\' events at the Jubilee in June but: \'The ball is in their court\'\n\nThe journalist, Princess Diana\'s biographer, is the author of the new bombshell book The Palace Papers: Inside The House Of Windsor - The Truth And The Turmoil.\n\nSpeaking on a New York Times podcast Sway to promote her new book, she said the couple made \'bad choices\' and could have left the Royal Family on far better terms if they weren\'t as \'hotheaded\'.\n\nMs Brown also labelled Prince Harry a \'very impetuous man\' and revealed how Palace advisors \'always thought he would leave\'.\n\nShe said she was told it was because \'he was so fragile, so combustible, he was so unhappy, frankly, in the constraints of the royal family\'.\n\nHowever, she also noted that the couple\'s exit from royal life was a \'disaster all round\'.\n\nThe Queen and Prince Harry\'s father Prince Charles are both said to very \'keen\' for him, his wife and children to jet in from California to mark the Queen\'s 70 years on the throne.\n\nBuckingham Palace is said to have promised the Sussexes full armed security at all Royal Family events in June in a bid to reassure them after Harry said he felt \'unsafe\' in Britain.\n\nBut despite Her Majesty and Prince Charles removing the main obstacle for Harry, Meghan, Archie and Lilibet attending, the Duke of Sussex is still said to be genuinely undecided about whether to jet in to celebrate his grandmother\'s 70 years on the throne.\n\nA palace source told the Sunday telegraph that \'the ball was in his court\', adding: \'His grandmother and father keen to welcome the Sussexes to “family” events\'.\n\nIt would mean that the Sussexes would be welcomed onto the Buckingham Palace balcony with the rest of the royals to watch a RAF flypast and the Trooping the Colour on June 2, the Queen\'s official birthday.\n\nBut they would be unable to attend working elements of the Jubilee, having quit as frontline royals when they emigrated to Canada and then Los Angeles two years ago.\n\nThe Sussexes recently caused outrage after Harry claimed in an NBC interview that he wanted to make sure his grandmother was \'protected\' and had \'the right people around her\'.\n\nIn an NBC TV appearance, Harry also opened up on his \'special\' relationship with his grandmother, and his very public claim that she confides in him things she cannot talk to anyone else about.\n\nExperts branded the comments a \'gross insult\' to Charles and William, and point out that his and Meghan\'s top secret \'olive branch\' meeting with the Queen at Windsor Castle before the Invictus Games was the first time Harry had seen his grandmother in two years.\n\nThe Queen is all smiles as she heads out this morning on the Sandringham Estate\n\nTina Brown said Sussexes made \'bad choices\' and could have left the Royal Family on far better terms if they weren\'t as \'hotheaded\'\n\nDiscussing the surprise meeting with the Queen, Ms Brown said it could be a sign of things to come.\n\nShe said: It’s a sign of a cautious rapprochement, and I actually think that when the queen dies, I would not be at all surprised if some kind of new charter, as it were, with Harry is drawn up, because I think they’re going to feel they do need Harry in some way. And he might get a bit more of what he wanted.\n\n\'I mean, he could be a kind of commuter royal, I guess. The problem is the money piece. You know, they wanted to make money. And the big tension there was conflict of interest. I mean, how do you work that?\'\n\nMs Brown\'s podcast appearance comes after her new book unveiled a list of bombshells on Harry and his relationship with the royal family.\n\nIt revealed how Harry \'vented\' about William and \'poured out resentments\' about his father Charles to his actress ex-girlfriend Cressida Bonas so much that she recommended he see a therapist, leading the duke to seek advice on the best shrinks from MI6.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex grew \'angry\' as he felt his brother was \'hogging the best briefs\' around a decade ago - and when he wasn\'t obsessing over William would moan about the Prince of Wales.\n\nShe claims \'friction between the brothers escalated\' so much after William became patron of the rhino and elephant charity the Tusk Trust in 2015 that the pair had \'Olympic rows\' - and quotes a friend of the siblings as calling Harry a \'very, very angry man\'.\n\nHarry and William stand together during the unveiling of a statue they commissioned of their mother Diana in the Sunken Garden at Kensington Palace, London, July 1, 2021\n\nHarry and William with a cheetah at the Mokolodo nature reserve in Gaberone, Botswana on June 15, 2010\n\nThe royal expert also claims Harry\'s ex-girlfriend Cressida grew \'tiresome\' of his complaints about his family while they dated between 2012 and 2014, and was apparently the first person to persuade the Queen\'s grandson to see a therapist - leading him to take advice from MI6 to find the right person.\n\nAfter their relationship broke down, Harry wrote the old flame \'a sweet letter saying \'I admire you, I wish you well and above all thank you for helping me to address my demons and seek help\'\', Mrs Brown claims, quoting one of her contacts.\n\nCressie is said to have also found his resentment towards the Press \'trying\' - and that while reports played-up the romantic love affair, the \'bizarre reality of date nights was glumly eating takeaway and watching Netflix at Nottingham Cottage, Harry\'s none-too-tidy two-bedroom grace-and-favour bachelor pad in the grounds of Kensington Palace\', Mrs Brown writes.\n\nThe tension between Harry and William existed years before Meghan Markle burst onto the scene, Mrs Brown claims. However, her arrival changed \'everything\' in Harry\'s life, and she suggests the pair became \'drunk on a shared fantasy of being the instruments of global transformation who, once married, would operate in the celebrity stratosphere once inhabited by Princess Diana\'.\n\nMrs Brown has also claimed that Harry and Meghan are \'addicted to drama\' - and says one day the duke will \'wake up\' and realise he\'s living in Gwyneth Paltrow\'s Goop.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex cheers on competitors during the powerlifting event at the Invictus Games, in the Netherlands\n\nHarry and Meghan during the Invictus Games on April 17, a week after meeting his grandmother the Queen at Windsor\n\nSpeaking to the Telegraph, the expert said the pair can\'t stop creating dramatic scenes wherever they go - claiming they appeared to be \'addicted to drama\'. And she warned the duke appears to have been \'completely and utterly taken over by Meghan and his whole personality has changed\'.\n\n\'I do question how it will end. \'[Maybe] he\'ll wake up and realise he\'s living in Goop and he has to get the hell out, go down the pub and see his friends,\' she added.\n\nThe Royal Family was last week left reeling when Harry, appeared to issue a veiled warning to those closest to the Queen when interviewed by a US network, saying he wanted to make sure his grandmother was \'protected\' and had \'the right people around her\'.\n\nThe duke did not elaborate on whether he was referring to royal aides or members of his own family, but his comments may have deepened his rift with his father the Prince of Wales and his brother William and perplexed palace officials.\n\nHarry also risked further fuelling the rift with his estranged older brother by stating that their late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, was now watching over him from beyond the grave as \'she\'s done her bit\' with William and his family.\n\nIn an NBC TV appearance, Harry also opened up on his \'special\' relationship with his grandmother, and his very public claim that she confides in him things she cannot talk to anyone else about.\n\nAnd in a barbed comment, he said of his visit: \'I\'m just making sure that she\'s protected and got the right people around her\'.\n\nSources have told the Daily Mail that the prince appeared mollified at the plans put in place when he and Meghan visited the Queen at Windsor last week.\n\nThe couple brought over their own private bodyguards from the US but stayed on the Queen\'s Windsor estate and received a Special Escort Group (SEG) detail when travelling outside.\n\nThe SEG provides mobile armed protection to both royals and government ministers. This \'hybrid\' model is now likely to be offered to Harry, Meghan and children, Archie, two, and, Lilibet, ten months, when visiting. It would be funded by taxpayers as the Home Office have made clear that they cannot agree private financial arrangements with anyone receiving Met Police security.\n\nHarry is taking legal action against the Home Office after being stripped of armed police protection. He says he does not feel safe under current security arrangements bringing his family to the UK and has offered to pay for British police bodyguards himself.\n\nThe duke\'s barrister, Shaheed Fatima QC, previously told the High Court that Harry considers the UK \'is and always will be his home\' and says he is keen to return to visit family and friends – although the prince this week said in a TV interview that home \'is in the States\'.\n\nA well-placed source told the Mail: \'Harry was fairly pleased with the way the operation worked [when he and Meghan came to Windsor] and the liaison between his security team and the Met. He believes it means a workable solution can be found, allowing him to come over with his children as early as the Platinum Jubilee.\'\n\nThe source said they believed Harry would now row back from his legal action.\n\nIt came as Donald Trump urged the Queen to strip Prince Harry and Meghan Markle of all their royal titles as he described the Duke of Sussex as being \'whipped like no person I think I\'ve ever seen\' and \'led around by his nose\'.\n\nThe former US president admonished Harry for being \'so disrespectful to the country\' and an \'embarrassment\' – adding that the Queen should ban him from even visiting Britain and tell him: \'Frankly, don\'t come around.\'\n\nMr Trump also said Harry had been \'led down a path\' and that he wondered whether the Duke - who stepped down as a senior royal in early 2020 with his American wife - would \'go back on his hands and knees and say "please".\'\n\nHe claimed is \'not a fan\' of Meghan and \'wasn\'t right from the beginning\', telling Piers Morgan on the new channel TalkTV: \'I\'ve been a very good predictor, as you know - I\'ve predicted almost everything. It\'ll end, and it\'ll end bad.\'\n\nIt was Mr Trump\'s latest attack on the couple, with him having previously spoken of his support for the 96-year-old monarch who hosted him with wife Melania in a State Banquet at Buckingham Palace in London in June 2019.\n\nBuckingham Palace declined to comment.', 'image': 'https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/26/15/57070487-0-image-a-16_1650983216127.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:58'}

If that's possible, that would be great.'\n\nBut during the interview, Mr Markle also blasted his son-in-law Harry as an 'idiot' and agreed with the comments made by former US president Donald Trump yesterday that the Duke of Sussex is 'whipped' by Meghan.\n\nMeghan's father Thomas Markle told GB News that he is planning to fly over to the UK in June for the Queen's Platinum Jubilee\n\nThomas Markle said he wanted to thank the Prince of Wales for walking Meghan down the aisle of St George's Chapel in 2018\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle attend the Invictus Games at The Hague in the Netherlands on April 17\n\nMr Markle added that he was contacting all members of the Royal Family ahead of his visit to Britain to make them all aware that he and his family have 'no ill feeling about the royals whatsoever'.\n\nHe also criticised Harry and Meghan for not bringing Archie and Lilibet with them when they visited the Queen at Windsor Castle earlier this month ahead of their appearance at the Invictus Games in the Hague the Netherlands.\n\nDonald Trump calls for Queen to strip Harry and Meghan of their titles Former US president Donald Trump has called for the Queen to strip the Duke and Duchess of Sussex of their titles. In an interview with Piers Morgan, Mr Trump told the presenter's new TalkTV show Piers Morgan Uncensored that Harry was 'whipped like no person I think I've ever seen'. He predicted Harry and Meghan's relationship would end badly, branded the duke an 'embarrassment' and said it was 'terrible' that he missed the Duke of Edinburgh's memorial service. Harry was absent when the royal family gathered in remembrance of Philip in March, but travelled with Meghan to see his grandmother the Queen for the first time in two years this month on his way to the Invictus Games in The Hague. In a later interview with NBC's Today show, Harry appeared to issue a veiled warning to those closest to the Queen saying he wanted to make sure she was 'protected' and had 'the right people around her'. Mr Trump, who first met the Queen for tea at Windsor in 2018, said of Harry and Meghan's Megxit saga: 'The only thing I disagree with the Queen on probably one of the only things ever is that I think she should have said, if that's your choice, fine. But you no longer have titles, you know.' The American billionaire added: 'I want to know what's going to happen when Harry decides he's had enough of being bossed around. 'Or maybe when she decides that she likes some other guy better. I want to know what's going to happen when it ends, OK.' He suggested: 'I predicted almost everything. It'll end and it'll end bad.' The Queen gifted her grandson the dukedom of Sussex on the morning of his wedding. Peerages can only be removed by an act of Parliament, although there are also limited circumstances in which hereditary peerages can be renounced by the holder. Sixth in line Harry and former Suits actress Meghan could be asked by the monarch to stop using their Sussex titles, although they would still technically retain them. Harry, a prince from birth, would become Prince Henry (Harry) of Wales, while Meghan would be Princess Henry (Harry) of Wales, as she is not a princess in her own right. After they quit the working monarchy, Harry and Meghan agreed to stop using their HRH styles.

I don't know if it's Meghan or if it's Harry but the Queen should have every right to see her great-grandchildren and I should have the right to see my grandchildren. So if they show up I hope they bring the kids.'\n\nQuestioned if he was expecting them to be in London during the celebrations, Mr Markle said: 'I'm getting the feeling that if they know I'm coming, they won't be coming.\n\n'But if they do come I would love to reach out, speak with them and try to figure out what was wrong and how we can repair it. I don't see that happening. But I certainly would like to try.'\n\nMr Markle said he wanted to also show his respect to the Queen and meet with Prince Charles to thank him for walking Meghan down the aisle at her wedding to Harry.\n\nHe also blasted Harry for his reluctance to travel to London from California over security concerns.\n\nMr Markle said: 'I think it's ridiculous. He knows how much security you're going to have. He's totally safe in that situation. So I don't understand the things he says and I have so little respect for that man. I think he's an idiot.'\n\nIn an increasingly brutal attack on Harry, Mr Markle continued: 'He's like a child. He follows my daughter around like a child. He's not a man. You can tell me he was in the military but, I can't believe it.\n\n'I think he's kind of a wuss and always will be. He's got a brother that's a real man and he's got a father who is a real man. But I don't think he's ever growing up.'\n\nLater, he also agreed with Mr Trump's assessment that Harry was 'whipped' by Megan.\n\nMr Trump urged the Queen to strip Harry and Meghan of all their royal titles as he described the Duke of Sussex as being 'whipped like no person I think I've ever seen' and 'led around by his nose'\n\nReacting to Mr Trump's comments, Mr Markle said: 'Well, that's the only time I'll ever agree with Donald Trump.'\n\nMr Trump had also admonished Harry for being 'so disrespectful to the country' and an 'embarrassment' – adding that the Queen should ban him from even visiting Britain and tell him: 'Frankly, don't come around.'\n\nMr Trump also said Harry had been 'led down a path' and that he wondered whether the Duke - who stepped down as a senior royal in early 2020 with his American wife - would 'go back on his hands and knees and say 'please'.'\n\nHe claimed is 'not a fan' of Meghan and 'wasn't right from the beginning', telling Piers Morgan on the new channel TalkTV: 'I've been a very good predictor, as you know - I've predicted almost everything.

Israeli aircraft struck hundreds of targets in Gaza, while Hamas launched thousands of rockets at Israel. The Israeli air force bombed and destroyed a 12-storey tower that housed dozens of families as well as offices belonging to the Associated Press and the Al Jazeera satellite channel.\n\nThe ADL counted 297 antisemitic incidents that occurred between the start of military action on 10 May and the end of the month, a 141% increase from the 123 incidents that it counted during the same period in 2020.\n\n“The perpetrators of many of these incidents explicitly referred to the conflict between Israel and Hamas,” says the report from the ADL, which is known for combatting antisemitism and tracking extremism.\n\nThe ADL said its tally of antisemitic incidents still increased by 46% during the last 20 days of May 2021, compared with the same period in 2020, even when incidents with explicit references to Israel or Zionism are excluded.\n\n“It’s alarming because the vitriol against the Jewish community is coming from all angles,” said Oren Segal, vice-president of the ADL’s Center on Extremism.\n\nThe ADL counted 15 antisemitic assaults between 10 May and 30 May last year after counting none during the same period in 2020. The group said there is evidence that at least eight of those assaults were motivated by “anti-Israel/anti-Zionism sentiment”.\n\nFor example, it cited an 18 May incident in which people in a caravan of cars and flying Palestinian flags attacked Jewish diners outside a Los Angeles restaurant.\n\n“The Palestinian supporters pushed one of the victims to the ground and kicked him. Soon after, a brawl erupted, and subsequent news reports indicated the attackers also hurled anti-Jewish slurs during the melee,” the ADL report says.\n\nADL also cited a 20 May incident in New York, where a Jewish man wearing a yarmulke was attacked on his way to a pro-Israel rally. His attackers yelled anti-Jewish and anti-Israel slurs while they punched, kicked and pepper-sprayed him, the report says.\n\nADL says its audit includes incidents of harassment, vandalism or assault that incorporated “anti-Israel and/or anti-Zionism themes” if they also express “classic anti-Jewish animus“ or “demonize Jews as a group for real or perceived support of Israel”.\n\nThe 11-day war led to hundreds of “anti-Israel” protests and rallies in the US, the report says. But the group says its audit didn’t include those events unless they “featured slogans or signs that directly linked their opposition to Israel or Zionism to all Jews or incorporated antisemitic tropes”.\n\nThe audit found that extremists groups or individuals, including white supremacists, were responsible for 484 incidents last year, up from 332 in 2020. The distribution of antisemitic flyers, banners, stickers or written messages accounted for most of those incidents. They also included acts of vandalism and bomb threats to Jewish institutions.\n\nThe group’s tally of total 2,717 incidents last year included 1,776 cases of harassment, a 43% increase from 1,242 in 2020. The ADL also counted a 14% increase in vandalism cases (from 751 in 2020 to 853 last year) and a 167% increase in assault incidents (from 33 in 2020 to 88 last year). The 88 assault incidents involved 131 victims, none of whom were killed, the report says.\n\nThe ADL says it compiles data for its annual audit by evaluating information reported by news media, victims, law enforcement and community leaders. The group says it avoids conflating general criticism of Israel or anti-Israel activism with antisemitism.\n\n“However, Israel-related harassment of identifiable groups or individuals may be included when the harassment incorporated anti-Jewish references, accusations and/or conspiracy theories, or when American Jews are demonized for their real or perceived support of Israel,” the report says.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72a2ed0c6531f5c3a68a83cdcb0db730b9c388cd/0_345_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=79daab065eb894f5a89211d41c663b48', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:28'}

Five months before that conversation took place, the FBI released data showing hate crimes aimed at members of the Jewish community accounted for almost 60 percent of all religion-linked hate crimes reported in 2020, a small drop from the percentage reported by the FBI one year earlier.\n\n"The sense that antisemitism is coming at Jews from all directions is part of why I think many in the community right now are really very concerned," Greenblatt told The Daily Break at the time.\n\nOn Tuesday, the ADL hosted a webinar to discuss the findings of its annual Audit of Antisemitic Incidents. Greenblatt and Oren Segal, the vice president of the ADL\'s Center on Extremism, both attended.\n\nBefore 2017, antisemitic incidents were on a "steady decline" from the early 2000s, Greenblatt said during the virtual discussion. There was a "historic" 57 percent spike in antisemitic incidents reported from 2016 to 2017, followed by the previous record-high number of incidents in 2019.\n\nDespite the coronavirus pandemic\'s ongoing impact on school openings last year, the number of antisemitic incidents on K-12 campuses reported to the ADL increased by 106 percent in 2021 while incidents at colleges increased by 21 percent.\n\n"Keeping in mind that the campuses weren\'t even open all year last year," Greenblatt said. "I mean, the data is stunning."\n\nReported incidents targeting Jewish institutions also increased by 61 percent, the report said. This includes Jewish community centers and synagogues.\n\nThere was an overall uptick in antisemitic incidents last May amid the conflict in Gaza, with the majority of that month\'s incidents reported after fighting began on May 10. In May alone, 387 incidents were reported to the ADL, which Greenblatt said represented a "massive" 148 percent increase over the number reported during the same month in 2020.\n\n"The perpetrators of many of these incidents explicitly referred to the conflict between Israel and Hamas," the report said.\n\nOf the incidents reported to the ADL last year, 1,776 involved antisemitic harassment, a 43 percent increase over the number of harassment incidents reported in 2020. An additional 88 incidents were identified as assault, and the 853 others were vandalism.\n\nThe ADL identified New York as the state with the greatest number of antisemitic incidents at 416, with New Jersey second with 370 incidents. California was the only other state to have more than 300 reported incidents, while 18 states had fewer than 10. North Dakota and West Virginia were tied with the fewest reported incidents, with one reported in each state last year.\n\nScott Richman, the director of the ADL\'s New York and New Jersey regional office, addressed his area\'s high numbers during the ADL\'s Tuesday webinar. The two states\' combined total for 2021 was equivalent to an average of about two antisemitic incidents per day, he noted.\n\n"This is no surprise to me," Richman said. "I see it every day."\n\nDespite widely-held beliefs that extremists are responsible for the bulk of antisemitic incidents, Segal said this was not the case for the 2021 report. Only 18 percent of last year\'s incidents were attributed to "known extremist groups or individuals inspired by extremist ideology," the report said. The majority of incidents are carried out by "unknown" individuals or "average Joes and average Janes," Segal said.\n\n"That, to me, speaks to the normalization of antisemitism as a belief and as a tactic," Segal added. "And that is just as insidious and just as concerning."', 'image': 'https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2026578/anti-defamation-league-annual-anti-semitic-incidents-report.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:20'}

And unlike most gubernatorial races, DeSantis has been seeing a range of payments -- small and large -- from states like California, Virginia, Ohio and others.\n\nOne of his Democratic opponents, Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, pointed out the geographical breadth of DeSantis' donors in a recent press conference.\n\n'He is raising dollars outside, mostly, from the state of Florida for his run for president in 2024 and using the people of our state in order to get there,' Fried said.\n\nCampaign finance laws however prohibit the governor from funneling his state campaign cash into a federal operation.\n\nThat hasn't stopped Democrats from trying to raise their own cash off fears that DeSantis would mount his own White House bid.\n\nHouse Democrats' campaign arm, known as the Democrat Congressional Campaign Committee, sent out a fundraising email on Tuesday highlighting a recent straw poll that apparently showed the Sunshine State's governor toward the top of a list of potential Republican presidential candidates.\n\n'And we’ll be honest. The thought of Ron DeSantis in the White House is HORRIFYING,' the urgently worded email read.\n\nTwo days during which DeSantis' campaign blasted out anti-Disney fundraising emails saw a combined sum of nearly $50,000 in donations\n\nIt went on to accuse him of attacking reproductive rights and public schools, undermining democracy and 'smearing Dr. Fauci' while 'parroting Donald Trump's election lies.'\n\n'It’s downright scary that such a dangerous figure is one of the GOP’s leading choices for President of the United States,' the DCCC stated.\n\nMeanwhile Democrats and progressives continue trying to take down the Republican governor, with some critics accusing him of using Florida to raise his national profile\n\nDeSantis' spokeswoman Christina Pushaw told DailyMail.com that the governor remains focused on his re-election bid in Florida and directed further questions to his campaign team.\n\nMeanwhile recent reforms passed under DeSantis are guaranteed to have a significant impact on millions of Floridians.\n\nThat includes signing a bill last week that revoked Disney's special self-governing arrangement on its 25,000-acre Disney World property.\n\nDisney, among the state's largest employers, was granted a specific tax status more than half a century ago allowing it to essentially run its own municipal government over the area.\n\nRevoking that status will not only likely raise taxes on Disney -- which has saved millions -- but also families in the area, according to estimates.\n\nFlorida residents living in Orlando and Osceola counties could see an additional tax burden of as much as $2,800, one local legislator told CNN.\n\nLast week, the Sunshine State's legislature passed the governor's proposal for a new Congressional district map that is expected to give Republicans a whopping four new seats and likely erasing three Democratic ones.\n\nThe map gives Republicans an advantage in 18 districts compared to just eight for Democrats, according to a breakdown by FiveThirtyEight.\n\nOnly two seats in the entire state are ranked as competitive toss-ups.\n\nMeanwhile House Democrats are fundraising off of left-wing fears that DeSantis could run for president in the 2024 cycle\n\nFlorida's GOP-dominated legislature voted on the map along party lines despite impassioned protests from the other side of the aisle.\n\nFor his own part, DeSantis has not said whether he's interested in running for president in 2024, deflecting any questions by insisting his focus remains on getting re-elected in Florida in November.\n\nBut his resistance to ruling the idea out altogether has reportedly rankled former President Donald Trump, according to previous reports.\n\nTrump's support of DeSantis launched him from another member of Congress from Florida to a Republican superstar and into the governor's mansion in Tallahassee.\n\nBoth politicians have dismissed rumors that they have anything other than a 'good relationship.'\n\nTrump also still comes out ahead of DeSantis in most polls of Republican voters. Though in polls where Trump is not involved, the Florida leader often dominates the list.", 'image': 'https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/26/21/57081251-0-image-a-18_1651006772191.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:21'}

If you do satire that bites too hard, like the Babylon Bee did, they will freeze your account, and so that is not healthy for a free society.\n\nDeSantis’s announcement comes days after his wife, first lady Casey DeSantis, announced that Republicans had a 116,000 edge over Democrats:\n\nPolicy Matters.

Russia is also proving that energy resources are a weapon. That is why the EU needs to be united and impose an embargo on energy resources, depriving the Russians of their energy weapons.”\n\nThe move will be a grave concern to those countries who are the most heavily dependent on Russian gas, such as Germany, but at a hastily arranged press conference, Polish ministers said they had sufficient supplies to weather an interruption while accusing Gazprom of a breach of contract.\n\nAnna Moskwa, Poland’s minister for climate, said: “There are no worries about shortages of gas in our homes. It is worth pointing out that liquified natural gas alone supplies the market sufficiently. LNG deliveries in [terminal] Świnoujście are growing – in 2015 there was one, in 2021 it was already 35. As of today, it provides for about 50 deliveries.”\n\nShe added: “Appropriate diversification strategies that we have introduced allow us to feel on the safe side in this situation.”\n\nPGNiG, Poland’s largest gas supplier, said it would file a breach of contract lawsuit over Gazprom’s decision.\n\nRussia currently supplies about 55% of Poland’s annual demand of about 21bn cubic metres (bcm) of gas but the country’s government has still been pushing the EU and other western allies to go further in punishing the Kremlin.\n\nLater on Tuesday, Bulgaria’s energy ministry said it had been told that supplies of Russian gas via the TurkStream pipeline would also cease on Wednesday.\n\nOnce a close ally of Moscow, Bulgaria has cut many of its ties with Russia, supporting sanctions against Russia and providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine.\n\nKiril Petkov, the country’s prime minister, and members of his coalition government were due to travel to Kyiv on Wednesday for aid talks with Ukrainian officials.\n\nThe Balkan country meets more than 90% of its gas needs with Russian imports, but the government insisted that no restrictions would be imposed on domestic gas consumption would be imposed for.\n\nThe NGO Europe Beyond Coal has calculated that the EU has sent more than €41bn (£34.7bn) to Russia in payments for fossil fuels since it invaded Ukraine two months ago.\n\nPoland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, had already said he intended to ban Russian gas and oil imports by the end of the year and there has been a move to diversify to cover for losses.\n\nThe key Yamal pipeline carries natural gas from Russia to Poland and Germany, through Belarus. But the Polish government had made a clear move away from dependency by constructing a liquefied natural gas terminal in the Baltic port of Świnoujście, run by Qatari and US companies, which is capable of handling 5 bcm of gas. It is being expanded to 7.5 bcm by 2023.\n\nThe extent to which Polish industry will be able to rely on this flow is yet to be seen, however, and other countries will be worried about the development.\n\nMoscow had warned clients in March that they risked having their gas supplies cut unless they paid in roubles.\n\nThe European Commission had nevertheless said companies should continue to pay Gazprom in the currency agreed in their contracts, about 97% of which are in euros or dollars.\n\nThe only EU leader who has suggested he would pay Gazprom in roubles is Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, whose rightwing government has pursued a close relationship with Putin’s regime for over a decade.\n\nThe move by the Kremlin comes as EU member states are drawing up a sixth wave of sanctions that could include imposing a ceiling on the price paid for Russian oil.\n\nBut there remains a reluctance in Berlin, in particular, to go hard on gas imports given the German economy’s dependence on Russia in that field.\n\nIn early April, Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, told the Bundestag that the country’s energy reliance had “grown over decades and cannot be ended from one day to the next”, given that it would lead to the rationing of energy to industry and the potential closure of its largest factories.\n\nOn Tuesday, Gazprom denied that gas flows to Poland had been stopped.

GOOG -3.04% posted slower sales growth as global economic turmoil disrupted digital advertising spending.\n\nThe company said first-quarter sales rose 23% from the year-ago period, the lowest rate for the tech giant since late 2020. In the interim, the company saw a period of massive sales growth, as small and large businesses alike flooded into the ad market seeking to win customers who spent the early period of the pandemic sequestered in their homes. Company sales advanced 41% last year.\n\nRising inflation, supply chain disruptions, Russia’s war on Ukraine and other factors have weighed on the economic outlook and, analysts say, companies’ appetite to spend on ads. Snap Inc. said last week that those pressures affected its financial results in the most recent quarter and could dent the ad market going forward.\n\nRussia’s assault on its neighbor, which kicked off in the first quarter, had “an outsize impact on YouTube ads relative to the rest of Google,” Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said on an earnings call. That came both from suspending the vast majority of commercial activities in the region, as well as a related reduction in spending primarily by brand advertisers in Europe, she said.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What are you looking for in Alphabet’s earnings report? Join the conversation below.\n\nAlphabet suspended some activities in Russia as the Kremlin took aim at Western companies that limited some local government-linked broadcasters.\n\nGoogle’s search advertising—often linked more closely to specific customer purchasing decisions than to broader brand-awareness campaigns—was less affected by the wider economic concerns. A rebound in travel as pandemic restrictions continued to ease helped underpin the company’s revenue growth, analysts said.\n\nGoogle Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler said that “people are seemingly back on the move.” Travel searches in the quarter were above what the company had seen in the pre-pandemic first quarter of 2019, he said.\n\nAlphabet reported $68 billion in sales for the first three months, meeting Wall Street expectations. Net income, weighed down by accounting factors linked to some investments, dropped 8.3% to $16.4 billion, below the consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by FactSet.\n\nShares in the company closed down more than 3% Tuesday and retreated further after the results.\n\nMs. Porat said some of the issues that weighed on the first-quarter results, including supercharged year-ago growth figures and the suspension of activities in Russia, would persist in the current quarter.\n\nYouTube, the internet’s largest video destination, felt some of the sting of the ad market turmoil. It contributed $6.87 billion in first-quarter sales, falling short of Wall Street’s expectations by some $600 million.

The focus for the company has been to develop and roll out the feature. Making money from it is expected to come later.\n\nAlphabet reported top-line growth in its cloud-computing business, where it is trying to catch up to Amazon. com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. The cloud business remains a heavy investment area for the company, and Google Cloud Services remains unprofitable.\n\nLast month, Alphabet said it planned to spend nearly $5.4 billion to buy cybersecurity firm Mandiant Inc. to better automate cyber defenses by injecting specialized intelligence into one of the world’s largest platforms for cloud-based tools.\n\nCybersecurity investments have become something of an arms race among cloud service providers, with a rash of ransomware and other attacks driving customer concerns about data security. Microsoft, which also reported quarterly earnings Tuesday, said that revenue and profit rose as demand for its cloud services and software products continued to climb, with the pandemic spurring more remote work.\n\nSales for Google Cloud rose about 44% year-over-year to $5.8 billion, generating an operating loss of $931 million. Microsoft, in its earnings, said sales for Azure and its other cloud services advanced 46% from the year-ago quarter.

Analysts polled by FactSet had predicted it would report revenue of around $49 billion and net income of around $16 billion for the quarter.\n\nMicrosoft shares rose more than 6% in after-hours trading after it unveiled a strong outlook on sales for the current quarter.\n\nThrough the pandemic, Microsoft and other business-software companies experienced booming stock prices and sales as organizations around the world used more digital tools to help with remote working. This has bolstered demand for Microsoft’s office applications as well as its cloud-infrastructure services.\n\nThe Department of Justice is investigating the U.S.'s largest tech firms for allegedly monopolistic behavior. Roughly 20 years ago, a similar case threatened to destabilize Microsoft. WSJ explains.\n\nMicrosoft remains the second-largest cloud-infrastructure vendor behind Amazon.com Inc., AMZN -4.58% but the company has been gaining market share by using its leadership in office applications as leverage to grab big deals for its Azure cloud. It had nearly 20% of the market in 2020, according to research firm Gartner Inc. —well behind Amazon Web Services’ 40%, but up from 7% in 2016.\n\nThe company’s overall cloud business was up 32% with $23.4 billion in sales as its rival to Amazon cloud infrastructure service grew 46%.\n\nAnalysts and investors have been looking for signs that demand is cooling. Software shares have been sliding this year, with Microsoft down around 20%, in line with the Nasdaq Composite Index.\n\nResults were largely in line with expectations. There were concerns that a slowdown might be on the horizon after the previous quarterly earnings were reported in January because the growth of Microsoft’s cloud service Azure for that quarter hadn’t been as strong as expected. Growth seems to be back on track now, analysts said, showing companies continue to spend on cloud services.\n\n“This is a good bellwether for the rest of software,” said Rishi Jaluria, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. “There’s no big slowdown in the spending environment.”\n\nMicrosoft is showing little sign of slowdown despite the war in Ukraine, inflation and other factors that have been hurting growth in many industries. The company expects its sales for the current quarter to be between $52.4 billion and $53.2 billion. Analysts had been expecting sales of around $52.8 billion for the quarter, according to FactSet.\n\nMicrosoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said the war in Ukraine is expected to have around a $110 million sales impact on the company in the current quarter.\n\nMicrosoft’s cloud-market push has come under criticism in Europe, where rivals have filed antitrust complaints. Last summer, French company OVHcloud filed one over licensing terms that it says make Microsoft products more expensive to use on non-Microsoft clouds.\n\nA Microsoft spokesman said in response to the complaint that it is continuously evaluating how it can best work with partners.\n\nMicrosoft has had a busy year. In January, it announced its biggest-ever acquisition with its $75 billion offer for Activision Blizzard Inc., developer of such popular videogame franchises as Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush. The deal is expected to bolster Microsoft’s Game Pass subscription service, which offers a library of games for a monthly fee.\n\nThe videogame arm generated close to 10% of Microsoft’s revenue in 2021. The company is trying to build it into another core business, by using its cloud infrastructure to take the lead in an emerging cloud-gaming sector.\n\nMicrosoft’s total gaming revenue grew 6% for the quarter, while its Xbox content and services sales advanced 4%. Its console sales for the quarter increased 14%.\n\nMicrosoft has seen a surge in usage of its subscription service after adding new games, said Satya Nadella, chief executive at Microsoft. He said the number of hours played had jumped 45% from a year ago.\n\nMicrosoft doesn’t expect the Activision deal, being reviewed by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, to close until next year. New Chairwoman Lina Khan has taken steps to increase scrutiny of deals. If it does close, Microsoft said it would become the third-largest gaming company by sales, with 30 game studios under its management.\n\nWrite to Aaron Tilley at aaron.tilley@wsj.com", 'image': 'https://images.wsj.net/im-528302/social', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:57'}

The trial in Charlottesville Circuit Court is expected to last about eight days. Opening statements are Tuesday.\n\nLove, of Cockeysville, Maryland, and Huguely, of Chevy Chase, Maryland, were both seniors who were weeks away from graduation. They were known for their play on UVA\'s nationally ranked men\'s and women\'s lacrosse teams, but also for their volatile relationship.\n\nProsecutors said Huguely kicked a hole in Love\'s bedroom door, then beat her after a day of golf and binge drinking, enraged that she had had a relationship with a lacrosse player from North Carolina.\n\nA medical examiner concluded the 22-year-old Love died of blunt force trauma to her head, but defense and prosecution experts offered differing medical opinions on the lethal consequences of her injuries.\n\nDuring the jury selection process Monday, many of the potential jurors told Judge Richard Moore they had read or heard media reports about the case after Yeardley was killed or during Huguely\'s criminal trial in 2012. Moore dismissed three potential jurors who said they had formed an opinion about the case and would be unable to put that opinion aside to serve as jurors in the civil case.\n\nThe civil trial is expected to include many of the same witnesses, although many of them are expected to testify in videotaped depositions instead of in person.\n\nHuguely\'s attorney, Matthew Green, said the defense will acknowledge that Huguely\'s assault and battery caused Love\'s death and that her family is entitled to compensatory damages in an amount to be decided by the jury.

Yeardley and Hugely both played lacrosse at UVA and were weeks away from graduation when Yeardley was found dead in her off-campus apartment in 2010.\n\nA wrongful death lawsuit brought by Love's mother, Sharon Love, seeks to hold him civilly liable for her daughter's death. The lawsuit is seeking $29.5 million in compensatory damages and $1 million in punitive damages.\n\nAs the civil trial got underway, Paul Bekman, a lawyer for Love's family, showed the jury happy photos of Love with her mother and sister. He described a kind, thoughtful and caring young woman who played lacrosse, joined a sorority and kept up with a rigorous academic schedule at UVA while making sure to speak with her family almost every day.\n\nBekman told the jury that Love and Huguely had dated for two years, but had a “rocky relationship” that was marred by Huguely's excessive drinking. He said fellow students will testify about earlier violent episodes when Huguely was drunk, including one that happened about a month or two before Yeardley was killed, when visiting lacrosse players from North Carolina heard Love yell, “Help, I can't breathe,” and walked in to Huguely's bedroom to find Huguely with his “hands around her neck.”\n\nBekman showed the jury graphic crime scene photos of Love as she lay dead on her bedroom floor, with her right eye bashed in, her face bloody, and marks on her shoulder and neck. Love's mother and sister left the courtroom just before the photos were shown and cried softly during several other portions of the opening statements.\n\nA medical examiner determined that Love died from blunt-force injuries to her head.\n\n“She died as a result of a vicious and brutal beating,” Bekman said.\n\nHuguely's attorney, Matthew Green, told jurors that Huguely admits he assaulted Love and that her family is entitled to compensatory damages in an amount to be determined by the jury. But he said the defense will argue that Huguely's actions did not amount to the “willful and wanton” conduct that is required to award punitive damages. In fact, Green said, Huguely did not intend to cause Love's death.\n\nGreen urged the jury to focus on the approximately eight to 10 minutes Huguely spent in Love's apartment the night she was killed. He said Huguely was a “party animal” who began drinking right after the UVA men's lacrosse team played its final game on May 1, 2010. Huguely's family was in town for “senior day,” and he spent the next 30 hours consuming 45 to 50 drinks, using a “conservative estimate,” Green said.\n\nThe following day, Love and Huguely exchanged angry, “immature emails,” but had patched things up by that night and were seen on video holding hands as they spent time with Huguely's family at a bar, Green said. Then, about 11:45 p.m., a drunken Huguely went to Love's apartment, where he kicked in her bedroom door.\n\nDuring questioning by police early the next morning, Huguely said he only went to Love's apartment to talk to her, but their argument quickly turned physical. Huguely said Love's head hit the wall and they wrestled on the floor, but that when he left, she only had a bloody nose. Her roommates found her dead about two hours later.\n\nGreen said Love's visible injuries were limited to the right side of her face, which he said is “consistent with a single impact, some kind of a fall where her face impacts the floor.”\n\nGreen said that when police told Huguely that Love was dead, his videotaped interview shows that “he just doesn't believe it.”\n\n“It's clear he had no understanding a fatal event had happened,” Green said.\n\nGreen said the jury in Huguely's criminal trial rejected a first-degree murder charge and instead found him guilty of second-degree murder. He is about halfway through his 23-year prison sentence.\n\n“Justice has been done,” Green said.\n\nThe lawsuit was initially filed in 2012, but was later voluntarily dismissed and then refiled in 2018.", 'image': '/static/img/wln_alt.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:55:46'}

The study\'s authors estimated "seroprevalence" caused by a prior infection — the presence of antibodies against the virus — based on samples gathered from thousands of routine blood draws around the country.\n\nSeroprevalence is significantly higher when including people who have antibodies from vaccination as well. By December, the CDC had estimated that "combined seroprevalence" between the two groups was already 95%.\n\n"We all know that there are some infections that go unreported, either because they\'re asymptomatic or mild, the person didn\'t get tested, or it didn\'t get reported. So seroprevalence was an important piece of the puzzle, and it helps us to really understand more kind of the public health picture," the CDC\'s Dr. Kristie Clarke told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nCDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky acknowledged Tuesday that the increasing use of rapid at-home tests was also resulting in a growing number of unreported cases, but said the agency was still confident that it had a "reliable picture" of COVID\'s trajectory in the country.\n\n"We\'re of course continuing to follow trends in positive PCR tests, and have also looked at data on a selected share of rapid tests. The trends are largely similar," said Walensky.\n\nWhile the agency officially counted 54 million reported cases by the end of last year, the agency\'s seroprevalence estimates suggested the true tally was more than double that figure.\n\nNow the study estimates that the Omicron wave nearly doubled the share of Americans with antibodies from a prior infection: seroprevalence among all Americans climbed from 33.5% in December to 57.7% in February.\n\nThe age group with the largest share of prior infection is children. For kids under the age of 12, seroprevalence rose from 44.2% to 75.2%. In adolescents 12 to 17 years old, seroprevalence increased from 45.6% to 74.2%.\n\nSurges in seroprevalence have also been recorded abroad.\n\nThrough February, the Canadian Blood Services estimated that around 23.7% of donors had antibodies from an infection — nearly quadruple the 6.4% recorded in December. In Scotland, authorities estimated last month that seroprevalence from a prior infection was at least 44.5% — up from at least 29.3% in mid-January.\n\nOut of two areas in South Africa, a CDC journal recently published findings suggesting seroprevalence in the wake of the Omicron wave climbed to 60% in a rural community and 70% in an urban community.\n\nClarke said CDC scientists were also working on a study that will be released as a preprint soon estimating the new true tally of COVID-19 infections.\n\n"During the period that covered December, January, February, so kind of the Omicron period, we found that the infection to case ratio was the highest that it\'s been. Over three estimated infections per reported case," said Clarke.\n\nTurning up antibodies from prior infections does not mean all these Americans are protected from future cases. During the Omicron wave, the CDC reported cases of people who survived a Delta variant infection and then appeared to be reinfected by Omicron less than three months later.\n\nOfficials repeatedly cautioned Tuesday that signs of a previous infection did not affect most of their guidance on taking precautions around COVID-19.\n\nHowever, federal health officials have repeatedly cited the widespread combined immunity from previous infection and vaccination in making predictions that the renewed surge of cases driven by the BA.2 subvariant of Omicron might not result in a repeat of the overwhelmed hospitals and morgues from the winter.\n\nWhile the BA.1 subvariant of Omicron had dominated new infections through February, BA.2 has steadily climbed in prevalence and now makes up virtually all circulating virus. More than a quarter nationwide are now linked to a specific strain dubbed BA.2.12.1, which has driven a surge of cases and hospitalizations in the Northeast.\n\n"Additional evaluation is currently underway to understand the impact of BA.2.12.1 on vaccine effectiveness. But importantly, we continue to believe that those who are vaccinated, and especially those who are boosted, continue to have strong protection against severe disease, even from BA.2.12.1," said Walensky.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2021/07/13/171cc454-10ab-4def-afcf-a8e2dfb05e07/thumbnail/1200x630/a2474c8d0d1364b6eb6ddf7588dc5866/GettyImages-1233630617.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:13'}

General Motors Co.’s electric Silverado and Stellantis NV’s electric Ram truck have yet to be released, and the launch of Tesla Inc.’s Cybertruck has been delayed until at least 2023.\n\nFord reengineered its current F-150 model with a new battery-operated engine, a cargo-carrying front trunk, and multiple electrical outlets that can power a home or a construction site.\n\nThe company said that it took 19 months to build an electric assembly line next to its existing Rouge F-series factory.\n\nGeneral Motors Co. took a different track by designing its electric Silverado from scratch, but it delayed the release of the new Silverado to the fall of 2023. The manufacturer gutted one of its old factories in Detroit to build the new truck and several other electric vehicles, and built new plants to supply the models with in-house designed batteries.\n\nFord’s fast-track plan aimed to beat its competitors by a year with a release of the Lighting in spring 2022, but the company in the past has suffered poorly executed launches, including the botched rollout of its redesigned Explorer SUV in 2019.\n\nFord reassured the Canadian autoworkers of Unifor Local 200 that operations at the plant in Windsor, Ontario—directly across the river from Detroit—which produces the engines for the classic version of the F-150 pickup truck, would continue, the Windsor Star reported.\n\nUnion president John D’Agnolo told the Windsor Star that he met with top Ford executives in Toronto about two weeks before the F-150 Lightning launch to get an update on the future of the company in Canada.\n\n“They’re still a long way from getting out of the combustion side when it comes to the trucks,” said D’Agnolo, who explained that Ford executives “don’t see until 2040 before they get out of the combustion side of it.”\n\n“Right now, those truck engines are their bread and butter and they’re not going to be making any changes whatsoever when it comes to that,” he said.\n\nD’Agnolo said Ford officials confirmed that demand for the Windsor-built 5.0-liter, 7.3-liter and the future 6.8-liter combustion engine models remains strong.\n\nHe said he expects the transition to the electric motor to arrive more quickly than anticipated due to government demand and advancements in technology.\n\nThe Canadian authorities have set a 2035 deadline for all new car and light truck sales to be electrically powered, but that regulation doesn’t include heavy duty trucks.\n\nReuters contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2021/05/31/truck-1027843416-1200x800.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:46'}

The Lightning and other forthcoming EVs have drawn positive reviews from critics and long wait lists.

A personal, guided tour to the best scoops and stories every day in The Wall Street Journal. PREVIEW\n\nTraditional car companies continue to chase electric-vehicle pioneer Tesla Inc., which plans to release its electric Cybertruck in 2023. Tesla is navigating its own supply-chain bottlenecks as it brings two new factories online this year—one in Germany; another in Texas—and tries to boost production to make more than 1.5 million vehicles in 2022.\n\nThe electric-vehicle maker notched a 68% vehicle-sales growth in the first quarter, while many other car companies saw sales decline.\n\nEV stocks fell sharply Tuesday amid a broader technology selloff. Tesla shares dropped 12%, a day after Chief Executive Elon Musk reached a deal to take Twitter Inc. private, partially by using Tesla shares as collateral for bank loans. Shares of Rivian Automotive Inc. and Lucid Group Inc. fell 9.5% and 8.7%, respectively.\n\nFord’s stock closed down 3.2%, while GM slipped 4.5%.\n\nA shortage of semiconductors continues to hamper output at some car factories, including recent interruptions at Ford’s U.S. plants that make gas-powered trucks.\n\nRivian and Lucid have cut their 2022 vehicle-output targets, citing supply-chain constraints. The war in Ukraine and lingering Covid-19 restrictions in Asia have further disrupted the flow of some parts.\n\nLucid late Tuesday said the government of Saudi Arabia had agreed to purchase up to 100,000 vehicles over a 10-year period. Its shares rose 5% in after-hours trading. Lucid’s largest shareholder is the Saudi Public Investment Fund, and the auto maker is planning to build a second assembly plant in Saudi Arabia.\n\nSome auto executives also have warned about looming shortages in batteries, particularly the raw materials needed to build them, another potential hurdle for companies straining to crank up EV factories. Fast-rising prices for core battery ingredients, such as lithium and nickel, are pressuring car companies to pass along those costs to consumers.\n\nDarren Palmer, Ford’s vice president of electric-vehicle programs, said the company worked with battery maker SK Innovation Co. to secure enough supply to support the beefed-up production schedule.\n\nThe latest electric vehicles offer the power to charge household devices or other EVs using the energy stored in the car’s battery. WSJ’s George Downs explores how some companies are developing vehicle-to-grid technology that would enable energy to flow from the EV into the electricity grid itself. Illustration: George Downs\n\n“We go from nothing to full-on production volume immediately. This is not a soft launch,” Mr. Palmer said. Ford plans to expand the factory’s capacity to an annualized rate of about 150,000 Lightnings by July 2023, he said.\n\nThe Lightning’s debut is a milestone in the auto industry’s transition to battery power because it is the first time a traditional car company has offered a fully electric version of a nameplate that sells in big volumes, said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at research firm AutoForecast Solutions.\n\n“In the past they’ve made halfhearted attempts that didn’t appeal to many buyers,” he said. “The Lightning is hitting the heart of the American market: trucks.”\n\nAuto executives and forecasting firms have said they have grown more bullish about EV demand. S&P Global Mobility, formerly the automotive group at IHS Markit, projects EVs will account for 16% of U.S. vehicle sales in 2025, double the percentage it forecast three years ago.\n\nFor the Lightning, Ford plans to use battery cells built at SK’s plant in Georgia and manufacture the truck inside a new factory on Ford’s Rouge complex near the company’s Michigan headquarters.\n\nFord Chief Executive Jim Farley in February expressed confidence that the company had secured the battery supply necessary to hit its Lightning output goals. He told analysts Ford would give priority to EV production in the event that chip supplies constrain output.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What is your outlook for the first all-electric F-150s? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe rollout will give Ford a jump on rival GM, whose most-direct Lightning competitor, the electric Chevrolet Silverado pickup, is expected about a year later. The other big Detroit pickup-truck player, Stellantis NV’s Ram brand, has said it is targeting 2024 for an electric-truck rollout.\n\nSignals of stronger-than-expected demand have prompted Ford and other car companies to rip up earlier production plans to deliver even more. Originally, it had planned to make around 40,000 of the trucks annually. It bumped that up last summer, and again early this year, to 150,000, after receiving 200,000 reservations.\n\n“We underestimated it,” Mr. Palmer said. “The customers showed us in the end.”\n\nFord also must overcome its own recent troubles with quality problems on high-profile vehicle launches.\n\nLast year’s reintroduction of the Bronco SUV after a nearly quarter-century absence from the U.S. market was mired with delays and quality snags. In 2019, problems ramping up output of a revamped Explorer SUV at Ford’s Chicago factory led to delays and dented profits, the company has said.\n\n—Nora Eckert contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Mike Colias at Mike.Colias@wsj.com', 'image': 'https://images.wsj.net/im-529921/social', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:02'}

She participates in rodeo barrel racing and has a sign in her office that says, "My horse is smarter than your honor student."\n\nByers, 59, is a retired Wichita high school music teacher and band director who was elected to the House in 2020.\n\nIn her email Sunday to 25-year-old University of Kansas graduate student Brenan Riffel, Helmer wrote: "Now, personally I do not appreciate the huge transgender female who is now in our restrooms in the Capitol." Riffel, who describes themself as trans-feminine and uses the pronouns they/them, released the email to the Kansas Reflector, a nonprofit news provider.\n\nTom Witt, executive director of Equality Kansas, called on the Kansas House to censure Helmer, something that would take a formal complaint from another lawmaker and a two-thirds majority vote.\n\n"It is a new level of toxic bigotry that I have not seen in this building before," Witt said.\n\nHouse Speaker Ron Ryckman Jr., a Kansas City-area Republican, said he hasn\'t seen Helmer\'s full remarks, but "It\'s unfortunate those words were said."\n\nByers said several lawmakers have moved away from her in the elevator, and that the Kansas Republican Party\'s last platform, drafted in 2018, declares that, "We believe God created two genders, male and female."\n\nIn her email to Riffel, Helmer wrote, "A doctor can inject meds and dilute but cannot destroy what God has done in the perfection of the HUMAN BEING."\n\nRiffel said in an interview that they weren\'t surprised by Helmer\'s response, "considering what it would take" to sponsor the bill banning gender-affirming care for trans youth.\n\n"The rhetoric against the LGBTQ community has been the same for years, that we\'re a threat to society; we\'re going to hurt people," said Riffel. "I just want to go about and just be myself."', 'image': 'https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/04/26/b69ab827-4ae2-40c4-ab67-420c0c3f2de4/thumbnail/1200x630/8c205500ccd17b4c647765da7716a376/image-2.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:56:11'}

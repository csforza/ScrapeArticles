        "text": "NEW YORK, April 26, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- In 2021, the U.A.E. property management software market was worth $53.9 million, which is projected to grow at a sufficient CAGR in the coming years, according to the report published by P&S Intelligence.\n\nDue to the rise in the investment in the construction industry, the market is touching new peaks. For example, the U.A.E. government has authorized a $15.5-billion budget to promote health, social, infrastructure, and cultural initiatives, as well as educational development in the country. Moreover, in 2020, for adding 8 million square meters of parks and green spaces to commercial and residential areas, funding of $544.5 million was approved in Dubai for 29 projects.\n\nGet the sample pages of this report at: https://www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/uae-saudi-arabia-property-management-software-market/report-sample\n\nWhereas, in 2021, the Saudi Arabia property management software market size stood at $37.0 million. There are several factors for the market growth, including the advancing construction activities, need for property management to be handled remotely, and rising demand for the SaaS model of property management. Above all, the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs of Saudi Arabia has started smart city initiatives under the Saudi Vision 2030 and the National Transformation Program 2020.\n\nIn the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia property management software market, the solutions category was predicted to have a revenue share of more than 70% in 2021. This was mostly due to the increasing demand for digital property management operations, the desire to limit the number of meetings as much as feasible, and the need to improve virtual colleague and manager cooperation. Furthermore, solutions assist businesses in methodically managing their clientele and providing simple payment and digital financing.\n\nOne of the main innovations in the software business is the cloud technology, which has drastically changed the way software programs are distributed to clients. As a result of this shift, software engineers may now concentrate on the technological aspects of their work, while outsourcing the administration to cloud service providers. There are many advantages of the SaaS model that will advance the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia property management software market growth in the future, such as reduced infra expenses and remote access.\n\nREACH by RentCafe, a comprehensive digital marketing company for multifamily property management, was established by Yardi in August 2021. REACH provides website creation services for businesses and properties, as well as bespoke design materials, such as logos and email templates.

        "text": "Growing GCC ownership of electric vehicles bodes well for a zero-emissions future\n\nDUBAI: Among the many industries facing pressure to make fundamental changes to their production processes is the automobile sector, a major emitter of greenhouse gases blamed for global warming.\n\nOnce in use, a typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThis assumes the average gasoline-driven vehicle on the road today has a fuel economy of about 22 miles (35.5 kilometers) per gallon (4.5 liters) and drives 11,500 miles (18,507 kilometers) per year. Every gallon (4.5 liters) of gasoline burned adds some 8,887 grams of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.\n\nSuch numbers raise the question of whether it is even possible for the titans of the automobile industry to significantly reduce their carbon footprints so that they can meet their environmental, social and governance criteria.\n\nFortunately, a surge in the popularity of EVs in the relatively affluent GCC countries is bringing the region closer to trends that characterize Western markets.\n\nGrowing by leaps and bounds over the past decade, the global EV market was valued at $370.86 billion in 2021, and it is expected to reach over $1.2 trillion by 2027.\n\nAdditionally, global sales of EVs have more than doubled to $6.6 million in 2021, according to the International Energy Agency, with green mobility making up 9 percent market share of the global car industry. This is more than double the share it commanded in 2020 and triple of what it had in 2019.\n\nIn the Middle East, interest in eco-friendly alternatives to the internal combustion engine vehicle is slowly growing as automobile manufacturers race to bring more EV models to the market every year.\n\nSaudi Arabia aims for at least 30 percent of its cars to be electric powered by 2030, following its pledge to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2060. Last year, EV manufacturer Lucid announced a long-term plan to build the first international manufacturing plant in Saudi Arabia, targeting 150,000 vehicles per year at the King Abdullah Economic City.\n\nSaudi Arabia is planning new electric vehicles production plants capable of building 150,000 models per year and an EV infrastructure to support them. (Madinah Municipality)\n\nMeanwhile, the UAE is pushing for 42,000 EVs to be on its streets within the next decade. To meet the rise in demand for green mobility, the UAE opened its first electric vehicle manufacturing facility in Dubai Industrial City last month, built at a total cost of $408 million. The facility is expected to produce 55,000 cars per year.\n\nThere is strong competition for a share of the GCC region\u2019s EV market, with brands such as Tesla leading the charge and others including BMW, Audi and Mercedes-Benz in close pursuit.\n\nNoor Hajir, head of transport planning and mobility at WSP Middle East, says there are positive signals in the Gulf marketplace, with many developers, particularly those in Saudi Arabia, embracing greener alternatives and future mobility solutions such as EVs to help them achieve their future net-zero targets.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a trend of private developers leveraging EV charging stations as a branding and customer incentivization tool within assets such as major malls and business districts,\u201d she said.\n\nStill, Hajir believes the region has a long way to go before the infrastructure required to make widespread private and public EV adoption a reality is in place.\n\n\u201cThe Middle East may be behind the curve compared with more developed economies in providing roadside infrastructure to facilitate and incentivize widespread private EV ownership, which relies heavily on public sector endorsement,\u201d she told Arab News.\n\nBeyond the challenge of having enough charging stations, EVs must also tackle the region's host and arid climate. (AFP)\n\nDr. Hamid Haqparwar, managing director of BMW Group Middle East, said infrastructure development for EVs in the region varies from country to country, resulting in different rates of adoption across markets.\n\nBut like many other experts in the field, he believes the region\u2019s overall direction is clear. Greener modes of transport are a key part of the sustainability visions set by governments, and mass adoption of electrified vehicles per market is \u201ca matter of when, not if.\u201d\n\nHaqparwar says during the current \u201ctransition\u201d phase the region is witnessing a wider range of EVs enter its markets, confirming that manufacturers will continue to expand their EV portfolio.\n\n\u201cThis growth of supply, along with expansion of the required infrastructure, will gradually increase the demand in the Middle East,\u201d he told Arab News. \u201cI would expect EV sales to see more growth in the next five years.\u201d\n\nAs desirable as the viability of EVs in the Middle East market may be, it is not without its challenges.\n\nIN NUMBERS * 33% Environmental damage caused by an automobile before it is sold and driven. * 3% Hybrid and EVs\u2019 share of total new vehicle sales in KSA. * 8% Saudis who think EVs will be increasingly common in the future.\n\nOne of the main gaps exists in the regulatory framework, both at the base economy and local authority levels, according to Hajir of WSP Middle East.\n\nFor example, in Saudi Arabia, where EV rollout is still in its initial stages, updates to these regulatory frameworks are required to streamline certification processes and encourage uptake, she told Arab News.\n\nAdditionally, she cited global-supply chain issues and the consequent lag time in manufacturing as a major challenge currently facing vehicle manufacturers.\n\nThe delays are likely to have a knock-on effect on some of the immediate EV projects being implemented in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cAverage procurement and delivery of EVs can take anywhere between six and 18 months,\u201d said Hajir, pointing out that adequate implementation planning and early engagement of both operators and manufacturers need to be considered by mobility service providers.\n\nThen there is the Middle East\u2019s hot, arid climate, which might adversely affect the longevity of battery life in EVs. Hajir says more Middle East-centric data concerning the full impact of heat on EV batteries is urgently needed.\n\nFor this as well as many other reasons, internal combustion engines are certainly still going to be on our roads, says Haqparwar of BMW Group Middle East. In his opinion, driving will continue to be a huge part of people\u2019s lives in the GCC.\n\nGlobal sales of EVs have more than doubled to $6.6 million in 2021, according to the International Energy Agency. (AFP)\n\n\u201cWhere other parts of the globe will see less cars on the road, this region is more likely to see new environmentally friendly models on our roads as individual mobility steps into a new era,\u201d he said.\n\nHaqparwar pointed out that while industry wide growth in EV sales is in line with evolving sustainability driven values of the region\u2019s young demographic, emotional sentiments still play a major role in their purchasing decisions.\n\nAt the same time, the region\u2019s younger generation\u2019s growing environmental consciousness is reflected in online conversations surrounding EVs in the GCC.\n\nRami Deeb, marketing manager CEEMEA at Talkwalker, the industry leading consumer intelligence platform, believes that real-time data will play a critical role in the development of the regional EV industry.\n\nThe company, which tracks conversations on blogs, social media, videos, audio, forums, and reviews sites in six countries \u2014 KSA, UAE, Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait and Oman \u2014 reports a positive trend around EVs in the GCC region over the last 13 months.\n\nNoor Hajir (L), head of transport planning and mobility at WSP Middle East and Dr. Hamid Haqparwar (R), managing director of BMW Group Middle East. (Supplied)\n\nDuring this time, there were more than 133,000 online conversations around EVs in the GCC region, 21 percent of which have positive sentiment and revolve around government pledges to become net-zero in the near future.\n\nThose who fall within the 25-34 age group discussed the latest technological innovations and mainly engaged with video customer reviews of EVs.\n\nThe 18-24 age group mostly shared their enthusiasm about the future and how technology companies like Apple and Sony are exploring the EV space with concept cars and 3D renders, said Deeb.\n\nThe same age group also discussed the harmful environmental impact of battery manufacturing and lithium mining.\n\nIn a study conducted in the Kingdom by the consulting firm Kearney late last year, 15 percent of the Saudi nationals polled said they intended to own an EV in the next three years, while 33 percent said the availability of more charging stations would increase their interest in buying one.\n\nAnother 23 percent said that the provision of more information and government fee exemptions could make ownership of an EV more appealing.\n\n\u201cGCC consumers are reacting positively to the potential of EVs in reducing carbon emissions, as well as the level of innovation they bring to the table,\u201d said Deeb.\n\nSimultaneously, \u201cmajor car manufacturers around the world are developing a clear road map to fit their factories into an EV future and announcing their plans to only build EV cars,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a handful of countries, several incentives are being implemented to increase consumer demand and interest, like dedicated free EV parking spaces, free toll tags, and free charging through the public EV charging network.\n\nGiven the abundance of market signals, Deeb believes the real \u201cthreat\u201d to the industry would be any resistance to change or disregard for consumer preferences.",

(Supplied)\n\nDuring this time, there were more than 133,000 online conversations around EVs in the GCC region, 21 percent of which have positive sentiment and revolve around government pledges to become net-zero in the near future.\n\nThose who fall within the 25-34 age group discussed the latest technological innovations and mainly engaged with video customer reviews of EVs.\n\nThe 18-24 age group mostly shared their enthusiasm about the future and how technology companies like Apple and Sony are exploring the EV space with concept cars and 3D renders, said Deeb.\n\nThe same age group also discussed the harmful environmental impact of battery manufacturing and lithium mining.\n\nIn a study conducted in the Kingdom by the consulting firm Kearney late last year, 15 percent of the Saudi nationals polled said they intended to own an EV in the next three years, while 33 percent said the availability of more charging stations would increase their interest in buying one.\n\nAnother 23 percent said that the provision of more information and government fee exemptions could make ownership of an EV more appealing.\n\n\u201cGCC consumers are reacting positively to the potential of EVs in reducing carbon emissions, as well as the level of innovation they bring to the table,\u201d said Deeb.\n\nSimultaneously, \u201cmajor car manufacturers around the world are developing a clear road map to fit their factories into an EV future and announcing their plans to only build EV cars,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a handful of countries, several incentives are being implemented to increase consumer demand and interest, like dedicated free EV parking spaces, free toll tags, and free charging through the public EV charging network.\n\nGiven the abundance of market signals, Deeb believes the real \u201cthreat\u201d to the industry would be any resistance to change or disregard for consumer preferences.",

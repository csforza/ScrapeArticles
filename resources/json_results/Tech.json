        "text": "The vulnerability that existed for the last 8 months allowed attackers to weaponize the VirusTotal platform to achieve remote code execution on an unpatched 3rd party sandboxing machine employing anti-virus engines.\n\nIn January 2022, a report dubbed \u201cVirusTotal Hacking\u201d revealed how the platform can be used to access stolen login credentials and other sensitive files. Now, the IT security researchers at CySource have reported a method to abuse the VirusTotal malware scanning service to execute arbitrary commands and access multiple internal hosts remotely by using a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability (CVE-2021-22204).\n\nAccording to researchers, the vulnerability could allow attackers to weaponize the VirusTotal platform and achieve remote code execution on an unpatched 3rd party sandboxing machine employing anti-virus engines.\n\nHow Could the Vulnerability be Exploited?\n\nIsraeli security services provider CySource\u2019s researchers Shai Alfasi and Marlon Fabiano da Silva embedded a payload in the DjVu file\u2019s metadata for exploiting the vulnerability, identified in ExifTool open-source utility. This utility extracts Exchangeable Image File annotations, metadata, and tags.\n\nMoreover, it can trigger another vulnerability to obtain remote code execution. This vulnerability is triggered by DjVu files and was identified by researcher William Bowling in 2021 in ExifTool 12.23. It was surprising that none of the VirusTotal anti-virus scanners could detect the CySource researchers\u2019 Base64 encoded payload they included in the malicious DjVu file\u2019s metadata.\n\n\u201cInstead of ExifTool detecting the metadata of the file, it executes our payload.\u201d CySource\n\nThe researchers also got a reverse shell that allowed them to access over 50 internal network hosts with high privileges at Google and its other VirusTotal security vendor partners. Every time they uploaded a file with a new hash and a new payload, VirusTotal forwarded it to bots.\n\nThis indicates that apart from an RCE, the payload was forwarded by Google servers to the company\u2019s internal network, partners, and customers as well. When researchers were able to invade the networks, they mapped out various services, including MySQL, Kubernetes container orchestration, Oracle databases, web applications, and Secure Shell (SSH).\n\nMore Vulnerability News on Hackread.com\n\nGoogle Released Patch after Eight Months\n\nThe vulnerability was disclosed to Google\u2019s vulnerability reward program in April 2021, and the report was accepted in May 2021. However, the fix was dispatched in January 2022, after which CySource received the green signal to share details of the bug.\n\nIt is still unclear why Google took so long to fix this vulnerability. VirusTotal is a trusted service from Google\u2019s subsidiary Chronicle, offering access to more than 70 different anti-virus scanning solutions from mainstream security vendors, including ESET, Kaspersky, and 360 Total Security. It is, therefore, quite shocking that a dangerous remote code execution vulnerability plagued this service for over eight months.",

        "text": "This morning's situation report from the British Ministry of Defence (MoD) sees only \"minor advances\" in the Donbas as Russia's renewed offensive suffers from the same logistical and combat support shortfalls that earlier frustrated its attempt to take Kyiv. \"Russia has yet to achieve a significant breakthrough.\" The decision to surround and contain continuing Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol has, the MoD thinks, both prevented redeployment of combat units from the south and reduced the effectiveness of those units.\n\nSaturday's situation report from the UK's MoD sees a protracted reset of Russian preparation to complete operations in Ukraine: \"Defence Secretary Shoygu\u2019s stated intent to introduce 'new methods of warfare' is a tacit admission that Russian progress is not going as intended. While it may indicate an understanding that the war is not progressing as planned it will take some time to translate this into adapted tactics, techniques and procedures, and then implement for improved operational effect particularly in regards to land-based manoeuvre warfare.\" In the meantime the Russian army will rely on heavy and indiscriminate artillery fire. \"Therefore, in the interim there is likely to be a continued reliance on bombardment as a means of trying to suppress Ukrainian opposition to Russian forces,\" the situation report concludes.\n\nReduction of cities by artillery is the one tactic the Russian army has shown itself able to execute; the Telegraph reports on the effects of fatigue and failure on the morale and efficiency of Russian maneuver units. Yesterday's MoD situation report drew attention to the friction low morale is imposing on Russian operations. \"Ukraine has repelled numerous Russian assaults along the line of contact in the Donbas this week. Despite Russia making some territorial gains, Ukrainian resistance has been strong across all axes and inflicted significant cost on Russian forces. Poor Russian morale and limited time to reconstitute, re-equip and reorganise forces from prior offensives are likely hindering Russian combat effectiveness.\"\n\nConcealing the scale of losses.\n\nThe British MoD also sees signs that the Russian government is working to minimize public awareness of the size of losses it's sustaining in the invasion of Ukraine. \"Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defence has proposed compensation payments for the families of deceased service personnel be overseen by military rather than civilian officials. This likely reflects a desire to hide the true scale of Russia\u2019s losses from the domestic population.\"\n\nRussian conscription of Ukrainians?\n\nUkraine has expressed concern that occupying Russian forces will seek to redress personnel shortfalls by conscripting Ukrainians and forcing them to fight on behalf of Russia. The British MoD explained yesterday that Moscow has done this before: \"The Ukrainian Main Intelligence Directorate and General Staff have accused Russia of planning to conscript Ukrainian civilians from the Russian occupied Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. This would follow similar prior conscription practices in the Russian-occupied Donbas and Crimea.\" Such conscription violates the Geneva Convention, and would amount to another systematic Russian war crime: \"Article 51 of the Fourth Geneva Convention states 'the Occupying Power may not compel protected persons to serve in its armed or auxiliary forces', and 'no pressure or propaganda which aims at securing voluntary enlistment is permitted'. 'Protected persons' in this context includes civilians within occupied territories. Any enlistment of Ukrainian civilians into the Russian armed forces, even if presented by Russia as being voluntary or military service in accordance with Russian law, would constitute a violation of Article 51 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.\"\n\nIt would be a violation of other laws of war as well. The International Committee of the Red Cross has a searchable guide to International Humanitarian Law where summaries of applicable law may be found:\n\n\"Article 44 of the 1899 Hague Regulations provides: 'Any compulsion of the population of occupied territory to take part in military operations against its own country is prohibited.'\u201d\n\n\"Article 23(h) of the 1907 Hague Regulations provides: 'A belligerent is likewise forbidden to compel the nationals of the hostile party to take part in the operations of war directed against their own country, even if they were in the belligerent\u2019s service before the commencement of the war.'\u201d\n\n\"Article 51, first paragraph, of the 1949 Geneva Convention IV provides: 'The Occupying Power may not compel protected persons to serve in its armed or auxiliary forces. No pressure or propaganda which aims at securing voluntary enlistment is permitted.'\u201d\n\n\"Article 130 of the 1949 Geneva Convention III and Article 147 of the 1949 Geneva Convention IV provide that compelling a prisoner of war or a protected person to serve in the forces of a hostile power is a grave breach of these instruments.\"\n\nThe protections have also been recognized in Russian domestic military regulations: \"Under the Russian Federation\u2019s Military Manual (1990), it is prohibited as a method of warfare 'to compel persons belonging to the enemy party to participate in hostilities against their country'.\" The Russian Federation\u2019s Regulations on the Application of IHL (2001) also state: \u201cIt is prohibited to compel the population in the occupied territory to serve in the armed or auxiliary forces of the occupying power.\u201d\n\nStamp collecting.\n\nThe Snake Island garrison's defiant \"Russian warship, go f**k yourself\" became a rallying call in Ukraine, especially after the Moskva, the Russian warship to whom the message was directed, sank after being hit by two Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship missiles. Ukrposhta, Ukraine's national postal service, issued stamps commemorating the incident, showing a Ukrainian soldier (presumably Roman Hrybov, who radioed the defiant reply to Moskva's demand that the garrison surrender) flipping the bird in the direction of a large but ineffectual looking Moskva. Within a few days of the stamp's issue, Ukrposhta said it had come under a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack apparently intended to disrupt domestic and international sales of the commemorative stamp. Ukrposhta offered no attribution, but in this case the circumstantial evidence pointing to Moscow is, as Gizmodo points out, too obvious to ignore. The postal service is working through the effects of the DDoS attack, and says that a lot of people are still getting through to buy the stamp. (Supplies are limited, collectors; act now.)\n\n#OpRussia: Anonymous counts coup.\n\nThe hacktivist collective has tweeted Its tally of recent successes claimed against Russian organizations: \"#OpRussia: Since declaring 'cyber war' on Kremlin's criminal regime, the #Anonymous collective has now published approximately 5.8 TB of Russian data via #DDoSecrets. #Anonymous vows to release more data belonging to Russian entities and government, including a commercial bank.\"\n\nOn Sunday Security Affairs published the results of its sifting through the documents Anonymous had leaked \"over the last three days\" and found that files were taken from four commercial businesses:\n\n\"Enerpred is the largest producer of hydraulic tools in Russia and the CIS, specializing in the energy, petrochemical, coal, gas and construction industries. The collective has leaked a 432GB archive containing 645,000 emails.\"\n\n\"Accent Capital is a commercial real-estate investment firm that owns or is directly involved with the management of many of the properties its clients invest in. The collective has leaked a 211GB archive containing 365,000 emails.\"\n\n\"Sawatzky is a property management company. Sawatzky\u2019s clients include Du Pont, Lenovo, Whirlpool, Aveva, Wella, Johnson + Johnson, Cisco, Google, Swatch, Avito, Samsung, Microsoft, Western Union, Saint-gobain, Turkish Airlines, and British American Tobacco. The collective has leaked a 432GB archive containing 575,000 emails.\"\n\n\"Worldwide Invest is an investment firm with ties to Estonia and Russian railways. The collective has leaked a 130GB archive containing 250,000 emails.\"\n\nThat #OpRussia represents a successful hacktivist action seems beyond dispute, but its achievements also seem to confirm that hacktivism in this ongoing hybrid war has yet to rise above nuisance levels. The nuisance is real, but it remains exactly that: a nuisance.\n\n\"Lacryphages,\" privateers, and state actors.\n\nAnonymous has been operating in the Ukrainian interest. There has been evidence of hacktivism in the Russian interest as well, although in that case it's difficult to distinguish from opportunistic cybercrime that exploits sympathy for Ukrainian suffering (\"lachryphagy,\" \"drinking of tears,\" in the colorful term used by an op-ed in TheHill), gangland privateering, and direct state action. CNN reports that humanitarian organizations working on Ukrainian relief have been the targets of phishing, or, as CNN puts it \"malicious links and pornographic material on their cell phones.\" Most aid organizations are relatively poorly protected non-governmental organizations, and in many cases have difficulty even recognizing that they're under attack, still less able to respond to an attack quickly and effectively. CNN quotes Amazon Web Services as explaining that the attacks seem intended to \u201cto spread confusion and cause disruption,\u201d which seems particularly odious when the activities being disrupted are the distribution of food, clothing, and medical supplies.\n\nSpeculation about reasons for restraint in cyberspace.\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald offers seven possible explanations for Russian offensive cyber operations to have remained at a nuisance level in Russia's hybrid war against Ukraine:\n\n\"Ukrainians are ready for it.\" The Ukrainians have had help.\" \"Russia may not want to destroy services it plans to exploit.\" \"Russia may be holding back.\" \"In a brutal war, cyber may not be needed.\" \"Russian cyber troops may be overrated.\" \"The ransomware epidemic alerted the world.\"\n\nSome, all, or none of these may be true, but the summary provides a useful compendium of speculation about the failure of large-scale, devastating cyberattacks to materialize.\n\nAlternative energy suppliers in Europe sustain cyberattacks.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that three alternative energy companies in Europe have sustained cyberattacks since Russia's invasion of Ukraine began. WindEurope, a wind-power industry group based in Brussels, says it believes the attacks originate with Russia. Presumably the goal is to make a shift from Russian oil and natural gas more difficult for European, especially German, markets. Two German turbine manufacturers (Enercon GmbH and Nordex SE) and one turbine maintenance firm (Windtechnik AG) have been affected.\n\nDisinformation: forged document claims Ukraine is reselling military aid to African countries.\n\nThe Atlantic Council offers a debunking of claims in the Kremlin-aligned Telegram channel Rezident that Ukraine planned to sell surplus \"armored cars, tanks, submachine guns, rifles, grenades, and bulletproof vests to African countries.\" All of that materiel, Rezident says, represents equipment Ukrainian forces need at the front, and the story has been amplified in other Telegram accounts as well as various Vkontakte pages. The document being circulated, and which is being represented as an official report from the Ministry of Defense to Ukraine's parliament, is clearly a forgery. It uses Russian orthography, for example, and it refers to organizations that no longer exist. The goal of the disinformation is to insinuate that Ukraine is beset by corruption. Rexident says \u201cWhile Ukrainian soldiers are dying due to the absence of weaponry, clerks from the Ministry of Defense are selling it under the premise of redundancy,\u201d and adds that the whole (fictitious) scheme amounts to a \u201ccunning scheme of enrichment.\u201d\n\nRosaviatsiya recommends that Russian airlines prepare for operations without GPS.\n\nIsvestia reports that the Russian federal air transport authority, Rosaviatsiya, has counseled airlines to be prepared to operate without GPS. \"This is due to its possible shutdown, as well as \"jamming\" of GPS signals and spoofing attacks when flying in the Kaliningrad region, over the Black Sea, east of Finland and the Mediterranean.\" GPS spoofing and jamming have been reported in those regions by Western sources, and that activity has generally been chalked up to Russian operators, but Isvestia offers no such attribution. RIA Novosti cites Roskosmos to the effect that it would be difficult to selectively turn GPS off in Russia, and that in any case GLONASS offers a viable alternative to GPS.",

        "text": "On Monday afternoon, a Crew Dragon spacecraft named Endeavour splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Florida. Now, less than two days later, SpaceX and NASA are preparing another Crew Dragon for launch.\n\nMonday's landing returned a crew of four private astronauts, whose 17-day spaceflight was sponsored by the private company Axiom Space. Since that vehicle's return, the manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, Steve Stich, said space agency and SpaceX engineers have been \"poring over the data\" on Dragon's performance during its return through the atmosphere.\n\n\"It was a very clean flight overall, with really no major issues,\" Stich said Tuesday morning during a press call with reporters. \"The team has looked through a lot of the data, and they've had a chance to review everything. They've looked at the thermal protection system. They have looked at a lot of the GNC (guidance, navigation, and control) data from the flight. Obviously, the parachutes were very clean this flight. The mains all deployed and went to full open, almost in unison, with no indication of any laggard this time, which was great.\"\n\nNASA officials were confident enough in Dragon's performance to clear a new Crew Dragon crew capsule, Freedom, for launch at 3:52 am ET (07:52 UTC) on Wednesday morning from Kennedy Space Center. This Crew-4 flight will carry Commander Kjell Lindgren, Pilot Bob Hines, and Mission Specialist Jessica Watkins, all NASA astronauts, as well as European Space Agency Mission Specialist Samantha Cristoforetti to the station. Weather at both the launch site and for the downrange abort zones looks fine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFive days after Freedom docks with the space station, the four members of the Crew-3 mission that launched in November will begin their journey back to Earth. This five-day handover will ensure a continued presence of NASA astronauts on the space station.\n\nThe return of Crew-3 will mark the completion of SpaceX's sixth human spaceflight in less than two years. \"That's truly remarkable, because all of this has been done through the pandemic,\" said Jessica Jensen, vice president of customer operations and integration at SpaceX, on Tuesday morning.\n\nSpaceX now has a fleet of four Crew Dragon vehicles: Endeavour, Resilience, Endurance, and Freedom. Company officials have said that, for now, SpaceX does not intend to build any more Crew Dragons. On Monday, the company's director of human spaceflight programs, Benji Reed, said he thinks SpaceX can presently support as many as six human spaceflights a year. This is a likely breakdown of those missions:\n\nTwo NASA flights to the International Space Station (until Boeing's Starliner vehicle becomes operational, and then this number would be one)\n\nTwo private astronaut missions to the International Space Station, backed by Axiom Space or other private companies\n\nTwo free-flying missions, such as the Inspiration4 and Polaris flights\n\nJensen said SpaceX is determined to continue flying humans into space safely despite the rapid turnaround. \"As exciting as this is, and as busy as everyone has been talking about, I just want to reiterate that safety is still and always the top priority,\" she said.\n\nThe webcast below should begin at midnight ET, or 04:00 UTC on Wednesday.",

Soon after the breach, Trezor customers started getting an email that stated that the company had suffered a data breach, and invited users to download a program to help them reset the PINs on their endpoints.\n\nThe program disguised a malware strain that allowed attackers to steal the contents of the wallet.\n\nThe lawsuit claims the poor standards of security at Intuit and Rocket Science Group (a subsidiary that manages Mailchimp) made such an attack possible.\n\n\"The hackers were able to access the Trezor email list (and likely other insensitive information) through MailChimp and/or Intuit employee accounts,\" the lawsuit states.\n\n\"Indeed, defendants confirmed that hackers used an internal employee tool to steal data from more than 100 of their clients \u2014 with the data being used to mount phishing attacks on the users of cryptocurrency services.\"\n\nThe lawsuit alleges Intuit \"willfully, recklessly, or negligently\" failed to protect its customer data, and was too slow to notify its customers of the breach.\n\nLevinson now asks for actual and punitive damages to be compensated, as well as legal fees. He also wants three years of credit monitoring paid for him, as well.\n\nVia The Register",

        "text": "(CNN) \u2014 The parent company of Facebook and Instagram is taking on a new role as a brick-and-mortar retailer.\n\nOn Monday, Meta announced the Meta Store, which will be the company\u2019s first attempt at selling its physical products \u2014 including the Quest 2 virtual reality headset and Portal video calling device \u2014 directly to consumers in person. The store will also offer demos of the Ray-Ban Stories smart glasses that were developed with Ray-Ban, but customers who want to buy them will be directed to a Ray-Ban website to do so, Meta said.\n\nUnlike, say, the Apple Store, there will only be one Meta Store for now, and it will be based at the company\u2019s campus in Burlingame, California (specifically, at 322 Airport Boulevard).\n\nMeta is the latest big tech company to open a retail store to showcase its hardware. Google opened one such store in New York last year. Microsoft shuttered its 83 stores in 2020, but reconfigured a few as \u201cexperience centers\u201d and started selling products at them in 2021. And Apple has made its hundreds of stores a core part of its business for years.\n\nThe store will open May 9, Meta said. It is, in part, an effort to get consumers more familiar with Meta\u2019s plans for a so-called \u201cmetaverse\u201d \u2014- a sci-fi concept that envisions, essentially, an immersive version of the internet, which the company spent billions of dollars on last year via Facebook Reality Labs.\n\nIn a blog post on Monday, Meta said the store will let people demo various products and will include a VR space that lets customers try apps such as Beat Saber and Real VR Fishing. These VR demos will be projected on an enormous, curved LED screen in the store for others to see.\n\n\u201cThe Meta Store is going to help people make that connection to how our products can be the gateway to the metaverse in the future,\u201d Meta Store head Martin Gilliard said in the blog post.\n\nBecause the store will be based on Meta\u2019s corporate grounds, it will also give Meta employees \u201cmore opportunity to experiment and keep the customer experience core to our development,\u201d Gilliard said.\n\nMeta is the leader in the small but rapidly growing market for VR headsets. Tech market researcher IDC estimates nearly 11 million VR headsets were shipped in 2021, which is a 96% jump over the 5.6 million shipped a year before, research manager Jitesh Ubrani said. Ubrani believes Meta\u2019s Quest 2 headset made up 80% of those shipments last year.\n\nIt\u2019s not yet clear if Meta plans to eventually take the Meta Store beyond Burlingame, similar to what Apple began in 2001 with the rapid rollout of its Apple Stores around the world. A Meta spokesperson said the company had no details to share about whether it might open any stores beyond the first one.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

The EU commissioner, who was key in negotiating the new Digital Services Act, warned that a lack of compliance from Twitter risked a ban for the platform in Europe.\n\nHe said: \u201cAnyone who wants to benefit from this market will have to fulfill our rules.

        "text": "Twitter\u2019s acceptance of Elon Musk\u2019s roughly $44 billion takeover bid brings the billionaire Tesla CEO one step closer to owning the social media platform.\n\nOFFER ACCEPTED, NOW WHAT?\n\nThe process is off to a good start for Musk, given that Twitter\u2019s board has unanimously approved his offer and is recommending shareholders do the same.\n\nUpon announcing the deal Monday, Twitter noted that the bid, which represents a 38% premium to the company\u2019s closing stock price on April 1, is a \u201csubstantial cash premium\u201d and would be \u201cthe best path forward for Twitter\u2019s stockholders.\u201d\n\nWhen Twitter\u2019s board adopted an anti-takeover provision known as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d just 10 days ago, the move was widely seen as a telltale sign that the directors were gearing up to rebuff Musk\u2019s opening offer or perhaps seek another suitor willing to pay more.\n\nBut the battleground shifted dramatically late last week when Musk disclosed he had lined up $46.5 billion \u2014 including $21 billion of his personal fortune \u2014 to pay for the purchase. Musk said other investors could contribute to the financing.\n\nThe locked-in financing not only underscored the seriousness of Musk's pursuit, but also appeared to open the door to other large Twitter shareholders interested in hearing more about his plans for the San Francisco company.\n\nThe details of those conversations aren\u2019t known, but Musk could point to a more than 20-year history building and running several businesses \u2014 most notably as the longtime CEO of Tesla. The electric car maker is currently valued at $1 trillion -- roughly 25 times more than Twitter.\n\n\u201cI think there is nothing better for Twitter than Elon Musk buying it and ideally replacing the board, and also doubling down on investments into products and new revenue-generating sources,\" said John Meyer, a technology entrepreneur and investor. \u201cMusk has the track record that he can do the impossible.\"\n\nIt would be easy to see why other Twitter shareholders might welcome a shake-up, as well as an opportunity to cash out of their investment. Before Musk disclosed his 9% stake in Twitter earlier this month, the shares were trading below $40 \u2014 not that much more it its $26 price when Twitter went public in November 2013. Since then, the tech-driven Nasdaq has more than tripled, even after a recent downturn. Twitter has been a laggard because the company has struggled to consistently post profits while generating lackluster revenue growth compared to the two dominant forces in digital advertising, Google and Facebook.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla\u2019s stock is now worth nearly 300 times more than when it went public in 2010. And after struggling to make money for more than a decade, the automaker is now extremely profitable with net income of $3.3 billion during the first three months of this year alone.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT?\n\nAs is customary once a company agrees to be acquired, the buyer gets to take a closer look at its books to make sure there aren\u2019t any red flags that haven\u2019t come up via the company\u2019s public filings.\n\nThis step in the process isn\u2019t likely to cause any obstacles for the deal, said Angelo Zino, tech analyst at CFRA.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s acquiring this company, not from a financial perspective,\u201d Zino said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to do what he wants with it and he\u2019s probably going to look to make significant changes to the business model of the company.\u201d\n\nWHAT SAY COULD REGULATORS HAVE?\n\nLast year, Twitter generated $5 billion in revenue, with $2.8 billion from the U.S. and the rest earned overseas, Zino said. The Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., or the European Commission in the EU, are among regulatory agencies that may review the proposed Twitter buyout.\n\nThe main issues the agencies generally focus on are how the sale of a company could affect competition in an industry, or whether it violates antitrust laws.\n\nThese reviews can take months, or longer, but generally represent more of a potential hurdle when two companies in the same industry are combining, or in the case of a single buyer, whether ownership already has a large stake in companies within the same industry.\n\nNeither Tesla, nor Musk\u2019s other company, Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, are social media platforms, so antitrust concerns are not expected to arise when regulators review the deal, analysts said.\n\n\u201cWe do not expect any major regulatory hurdles to the deal getting done as this soap opera now ends with Musk owning Twitter,\u201d Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a research note Monday.\n\nWHEN DO SHAREHOLDERS GET TO VOTE?\n\nThe deal is expected to close in 2022, subject to the approval of Twitter shareholders. Twitter hasn\u2019t announced the timing of a shareholder vote, though the company\u2019s annual meeting is set for May 25, which could offer a convenient time to poll shareholders.\n\nA company can elect to hold a shareholder vote at any time, even before regulators have finished reviewing a proposed takeover.\n\nWHAT ABOUT TWITTER LEADERSHIP?\n\nAt this early stage, it\u2019s unclear what will happen to Twitter's current board or management team if the deal is completed, but Musk has made it abundantly clear that he believes the company has been poorly run. That assessment is a strong indication that Musk\u2019s makeover will also include a purge of Twitter\u2019s top ranks.",

        "text": "One crypto bro steps down; another comes to take his place. Just a few weeks after announcing his bid for Twitter, Elon Musk has entered a \u201cdefinitive agreement\u201d to purchase full ownership of the company. The deal is valued at around $44 billion, and upon its completion, Twitter will exit the stock market and become a private company.\n\nTesla CEO and meme enthusiast Elon Musk recently purchased a large share of Twitter, enough to join the board of directors. He quickly decided to take the whole company, citing his disappointment in how Twitter handles \u201cfree speech\u201d and spam. He\u2019s also expressed interest in making Twitter open-source, which would spawn clones of the website and make third-party extensions easier to develop.\n\nDespite some clapback on social media and a poison pill anti-buyout strategy from Twitter\u2019s leadership, Elon Musk\u2019s plan worked. This deal is simply too lucrative for shareholders to ignore\u2014at a price of $54.20 per share, Musk is purchasing the stock at a nearly 40% premium.\n\nAny changes that Musk will make to Twitter are unknown. But the new CEO will likely focus on spam (his threads are full of replies from bot accounts) and whatever he perceives as free speech. We may also see a restructuring within the company; Musk is pretty hands-on with his businesses, and of course, he\u2019s constantly using Twitter while constantly criticizing the platform.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has a lot in common with Elon Musk. They\u2019re both flush with cash, they\u2019re both complete weirdos, and they both love cryptocurrency. Dorsey actually stepped down from Twitter last year to focus on cryptocurrency at Square (now called Block), his banking and sales company.\n\nI guess we\u2019ll have to wait and see what the epic memelord does with his new toy. Personally, I hope he just shuts Twitter down for laughs. It would improve my mental health, and it would probably make the world a better place.",

His on-again, off-again stance begun in 2018 with a tweet Musk issued that claimed that he was securing financing to buy Twitter and take it private, a tweet he later said was a joke after an SEC investigation. Of course, those are the very actions Musk took today.\n\nMusk later posted a December tweet that Bloomberg described as \u201cdepict[ing] [Twitter CEO Parag] Agrawal as Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin and Dorsey as Soviet secret police head Nikolai Yezhov being shoved into water.\u201d Musk also asked, via tweet, whether his followers believed that Twitter preserved free speech.\n\n\u201cFree speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,\u201d Musk said in a statement. \u201cI also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.

Send tips to The Hill\u2019s Rebecca Klar, Chris Mills Rodrigo and Ines Kagubare. Someone forward you this newsletter? Subscribe here.\n\nWhat to watch as Musk acquires Twitter\n\nElon Musk and Twitter\u2019s board on Monday agreed on a deal for the eccentric Tesla CEO to acquire the company at $54.20 per share in cash.\n\nThe marriage of the world\u2019s richest man and one of the most influential social media platforms \u2014 of which he is an active user -\u2014 has left questions about how the company will be run, what it means for American politics and the dissemination of information in general.\n\nHere are five things we\u2019ll be watching as details of the company\u2019s new makeup become public:\n\n1. Will banned users return?\n\nMusk has laid out a more relaxed vision for content moderation that would lean toward temporary \u201ctimeouts\u201d over permanent bans.\n\nAdvocacy groups are concerned that this switch could reverse Twitter\u2019s permanent bans on public figures and politicians \u2014 including former President Trump.\n\n2. Leadership changes: While Musk and Twitter did agree on a deal for taking the company private on Monday, the purchase itself may take until the end of 2022 to wrap up while shareholders vote on the agreement and regulatory hurdles are cleared.\n\nDuring that time, CEO Parag Agrawal and the independent board that approved the offer will remain in charge of Twitter.\n\n3. How could the product change?: Major changes are likely to wait until the deal is completed.\n\nMusk has given some hints to what those could look like beyond his commitment to \u201cfree speech.\u201d\n\n4. Washington\u2019s ire: Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are using Musk\u2019s takeover to fuel their respective battles against powerful tech companies.\n\nRepublicans are embracing Musk as an ally in their fight against \u201cBig Tech.\u201d\n\n5. How will Twitter\u2019s workers respond?: Twitter has long been known as one of the most open places to work in Silicon Valley.\n\nWorkers have been encouraged to share their thoughts and feelings on the platform for years. Many of them did just that Monday as news of the deal broke, expressing confusion and dismay.\n\nRead more here.\n\nCOVID ABSENCES FURTHER DELAY FTC VOTE\n\nThe vote on Alvaro Bedoya\u2019s nomination to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is expected to be further delayed due to COVID-19 linked absences in the Senate, according to a senior Senate Democratic aide.\n\nSens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Vice President Harris all tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday.\n\nRepublicans have broadly pushed back on Bedoya\u2019s nomination to the FTC, leaving Democrats in need of all senators and Harris present to secure his confirmation.\n\nThe Senate aide said absent to an objection by Republicans, the Senate is expected to delay the consideration of Bedoya to a later date.\n\nThe Senate Commerce Committee advanced Bedoya in a vote along party lines in March, after delays based on Sen. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n\u2019s (D-N.M.) absence while he recovered from a stroke.\n\nAs he awaits confirmation, the FTC remains split along party lines, thwarting Democrats from pushing forward with their full agenda.\n\nEU WARNS MUSK\n\nThierry Breton, the European Union\u2019s commissioner for the internal market, tweeted Tuesday that Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who just secured a deal to buy Twitter, will have to comply with the commission\u2019s rules on moderation.\n\n\u201cBe it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules \u2014 regardless of their shareholding,\u201d Breton tweeted. \u201cMr Musk knows this well.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is familiar with European rules on automotive, and will quickly adapt to the Digital Services Act.\u201d\n\nRead more here.\n\nBITS AND PIECES\n\nAn op-ed to chew on: Elon Musk\u2019s Twitter purchase brings free speech into sharp focus\n\nLighter click: happy carrot time\n\nNotable links from around the web:\n\nWhat Elon Musk\u2019s battles with Washington might mean for Twitter (Politico / Emily Birnbaum)\n\nHow to Become a MAGA Rap Kingpin (Without Believing What You\u2019re Saying) (Rolling Stone / Alice Hines)\n\nFacebook Doesn\u2019t Know What It Does With Your Data, Or Where It Goes: Leaked Document (Motherboard / Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai)\n\nOne last thing: Truth Social struggles\n\nShares that are tied with the company funding former President Trump\u2019s latest social media venture, Truth Social, took a dive on Monday after social media platform Twitter announced its deal with Tesla CEO Elon Musk.\n\nCNBC reported that Digital World Acquisition Corp.\u2019s shares fell to nearly 13 percent on Monday, bringing the company\u2019s year-to-date losses to more than 30 percent.\n\nTruth Social, which officially launched in February, was created by Trump after he was permanently banned from multiple social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram for actions involving the Jan.6 insurrection at the Capitol, CNBC noted.\n\nRead more here.\n\nThat\u2019s it for today, thanks for reading.

        "text": "MONTREAL -- While remaining unvaccinated against COVID-19 is often framed as a personal choice, those who spurn the vaccines raise the risk of infection for those around them, a new study suggests.\n\nThe research published Monday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal found that vaccinated people who mix with those who are not vaccinated have a significantly greater chance of being infected than those who stick with people who have received the shot.\n\nIn contrast, unvaccinated people's risk of contracting COVID-19 drops when they spend time with people who are vaccinated, because they serve as a buffer to transmission, according to the mathematical model used in the study.\n\nCo-author David Fisman, of the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana school of public health, said the message of the study is that the choice to get vaccinated can't be thought of as merely personal.\n\n\"You may like to drive your car 200 kilometres an hour and think that's fun, but we don\u2019t allow you to do that on a highway partly because you can kill and injure yourself, but also because you're creating risk for those around you,\" he said in a recent interview.\n\nFisman said the idea for study came a few months ago amid the debate around vaccine passports and vaccine mandates.\n\n\"We thought what was missing from that conversation was, what are the rights of vaccinated people to be protected from unvaccinated people?\" he said.\n\nThe conclusion, he said, is that \"public health is something you actually have to do collectively.\"\n\n\"What we kind of concluded is that the decision to not be vaccinated \u2014 you can't really regard it as a self-regarding risk (because) you're creating risk for other people around you by interacting with them,\" he said.\n\nThe researchers used a mathematical model to estimate how many infections would occur in a population, depending on how much mixing occurred between vaccinated and unvaccinated people. It found that when people mixed with people of a similar vaccination status, infection rates among vaccinated people decreased from 15 per cent to 10 per cent, and they increased from 62 per cent to 79 per cent among those who were not vaccinated.\n\nFisman said that in real life, people tend to spend the most time with people who are similar to them. So, he said, even if vaccinated people are most likely to spend time with others who have received shots, they're disproportionately impacted when they spend time with those who haven't.\n\nHe said the arrival of more contagious COVID-19 variants, such as Omicron, have impacted both vaccine effectiveness and public faith in vaccination. But he said that even when vaccine efficacy was lowered to 40 per cent in the model and the reproductive rate was increased to account for a more contagious variant the overall conclusions were the same.\n\nHe said the study actually underplays the importance of vaccines in one way because it doesn't take into account how they vastly cut the chances of death and hospitalization.\n\nFisman said the results, from a purely \"utilitarian\" perspective, provide justification for the implementation of public health measures such as vaccine passports and vaccine mandates.\n\nHowever, he acknowledges that a simple mathematical model doesn't fully reflect the real world or the diverse factors that must be taken into account when setting public health policy, including political considerations and public anger.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published April 25, 2022.\n\n___\n\nWhat questions do you have about Omicron?\n\nWith the emergence of a new COVID-19 variant of concern, labelled Omicron, CTVNews.ca wants to hear from Canadians with any questions.\n\nTell us what you\u2019d like to know when it comes to the Omicron COVID-19 variant.\n\nTo submit your question, email us at dotcom@bellmedia.ca with your name, location and question.

Take five, Dave, take five.\n\nI have tons of emails and stories to look over every morning. I have the time to do this because I\u2019m semi-retired.\n\nIt\u2019s part of my job now, as a columnist with several websites, including the Western Standard.\n\nIt\u2019s a great privilege and I enjoy it.\n\nBut this one really took the cake.\n\nIt was a story that ran in The Defense Post, as follows:\n\nThe Canadian military is acquiring three spy planes under a US foreign military sales agreement to boost its aerial surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities.\n\nWith a combined price tag of $247 million, Canada\u2019s new 350ER King Air spy planes will be fitted with cutting-edge surveillance gear such as MX-15D targeting equipment.\n\nThe gear features a powerful camera similar to those used in Ukraine to follow Russian troop movements and target airstrikes.\n\nOnce in service, the 350ER King Air aircraft will be used by the Canadian Special Operations Forces Command for missions \u201cat home and abroad.\u201d\n\nOK, that was the news, but check out this follow-up statement \u2026\n\nFor retired Canadian lieutenant-colonel Steve Day, the spy plane can not only be used in international military missions but also to address domestic terrorist threats.\n\nHe described the 350ER King Air aircraft as a \u201cvery sophisticated platform\u201d due to its state-of-the-art sensors and warning systems.\n\n350ER King Air aircraft\n\nFolks \u2026 let\u2019s have a closer look at this.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze it and see what this really means for you and me. These are your tax dollars and you deserve to know what is going on here.\n\nIt\u2019s clear these aircraft are state of the art. No question about that.\n\nAccording to The Defense Post, developed by Textron Aviation\u2019s Beechcraft, the 350ER King Air has reportedly become a \u201cpopular basis\u201d for intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance.\n\nIt can fly up to 2,311 nautical miles (4,279 kilometers/2,659 miles) and carry up to 10 personnel, including two crew, the report said. Its maximum speed is 303 knots (561 km/h-348 mph).\n\nOfficially, the sale will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the US by helping to improve the military capability of Canada.\n\nThat is a cool toy, right? A very cool toy.\n\nWill it be used by CSIS, Counter Narcotics (RCMP) or the military? They say Canadian Special Operations Forces Command, but what the hell does that mean?\n\nFurther, who in God\u2019s name will it be used against?\n\nIf it was to be used internationally \u2014 against the Islamic State in northern Iraq or in Syria \u2014 the aircraft would have to be ferried to its location. Does that sound practical to you?\n\nInstead, why wouldn\u2019t we buy ARTEMIS (the Airborne Reconnaissance and Target Exploitation Multi-Mission System) in the Bombardier Challenger 650, currently being used by the US Army over Eastern Europe?\n\nNo, these King Airs aren\u2019t going anywhere, so to speak. They will be used in Canada. And it doesn\u2019t take a college grad to figure that out.\n\nWe know they won\u2019t be used in the Arctic against the Russians.\n\nCanada is looking at buying P-8A Poseidon long-range maritime aircraft from Boeing to replace its aging fleet of CP-140 Auroras, as part of the never-ending Canadian Multi-Mission Aircraft (CMMA) project.\n\nA replacement program that should have happened years ago.\n\nNo \u2026 my fear, my great fear, is they will be used against us. That\u2019s right, us.\n\nThose evil \u201cNazi\u201d truckers and Bouncy Castle revolutionaries \u2014 people who have different ideas that they don\u2019t like, people they fear.\n\nThe Fred and Marthas who donated to the Freedom Convoy, who were vilified by a cowardly prime minister who ran and hid.\n\nPeople like me, who write the truth. People who don\u2019t shovel their driveways or people who like Sean Penn. Take your pick.\n\nGod forbid they use it against eco-terrorists in northern BC. No, that would make sense.\n\nAccording to my intel sources, because we have so very few internal threats (other than Iraqi and Russian embassy staff under 24/7 surveillance), they will have to pull old security files.\n\nKeep in mind that one in four Canadians has an RCMP file.\n\nYou thought you had freedom? Say goodnight, Virginia. The new era has arrived, and \u201cwe\u201d are the enemy.\n\nClearly, they will have to dig deep, very deep to find new threats \u2014 even if they have to invent them to keep those shiny twin-engine beauties flying.\n\nYour basic, \u201cRound up the usual suspects,\u201d so they can justify this expense.\n\nJust imagine, folks, everything you ever texted on your cellphone or said on social media, every inch of metadata, is being tracked and monitored by the Communications Security Establishment (CSE), Canada\u2019s other spy agency.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, but this spy plane deal is a joke. This is a waste of money.\n\nWhy?\n\nSimple. Ask any eight-year old, who asks his mom and dad to buy them a Chinese-made DJI drone at Amazon.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that drones are far cheaper, more effective and easier to deploy anywhere in the world.\n\nInterestingly, they could be fully operated and controlled from Spec Ops Command in Petawawa, Ont.\n\nAs we speak, drones are re-writing the rules of war over Ukraine and kicking Russian ass. They are a proven commodity.\n\nThe other thing the RCMP Air Service has employed is spy planes over Canadian cities for decades, one of which was LCT (Lima Charlie Tango).\n\nFor entertainment, I used to tune in on my Sony air radio to hear them talk with Air Traffic Control \u2014 it was laughable. Literally anyone, any bad guy in southern Alberta, could hear everything they said.\n\nCities like Calgary also have the HAWCS helicopter for surveillance and watch-list harassment.\n\nSo why in God\u2019s name are we buying these things? Why are we buying a howitzer to kill a mosquito?\n\nIs it because allies like Australia, New Zealand, the UK, and the US have them and we have to keep up with the neighbourhood?\n\nThat\u2019s probably a big part of it, I would think \u2014 the potential for near-real-time data transfer and interoperability with allies. \u202a\n\nBe there or be square, as they say.\n\nThe other part: I think it\u2019s clear there\u2019s a big new intelligence push happening in Canada. It\u2019s a scary world out there and it\u2019s getting scarier.\n\nCall it the Putin factor, the ISIS factor, the Trucker factor \u2026 whatever.\n\nBut it\u2019s happening and you, my friends, are going to pay for it with your tax dollars whether you like it or not.\n\nThe cost in freedom is yet to be determined.\n\nDave Makichuk is a Western Standard contributor.\n\nPTacitus27@gmail.com",

In Canada, vaccine-free Canadians still cannot board a train or a plane and travel from one region of the country to another.\n\nIn Canada, air and train travel are regulated by the federal government, even when you travel within the same province. The feds have made it so only a vaccine passport, or very limited jab exemptions, will afford you the opportunity to visit family, friends, or travel for work.\n\nThis means that if you lived in, let\u2019s say, Kitchener, Ontario, you could not get on a VIA Rail train and travel to Toronto\u2026 even though you could travel from Kitchener to Toronto on a commuter train that is not under federal jurisdiction.\n\nIsn\u2019t \u201cscience\u201d wonderful!\n\nOh, and vaccine-free Canadians also can\u2019t LEAVE the country. Unjabbed Canadians are told they can\u2019t \u201cput others at risk\u201d by boarding a plane with vaccinated people (because vaccines suddenly\u2026work?). Apparently, it is good for the unvaccinated to stay in Canada, even though \u2026 they are risk to everyone else who is protected by a vaccine?\n\nTrudeau\u2019s insecurity on display\n\nNow, on the one hand it is quite easy to understand why Trudeau is acting like an evil dictator: he has proven himself to be an immoral tyrant on many occasions. However, given the fact that other leftist tyrants have eased up, it is clearly not just leftism or progressivism that causing him to trap Canadians indefinitely in their home like real-life versions of The Truman Show. (How fitting that it was Canadian Jim Carrey who starred in that film.)\n\nThere is something unique about Trudeau that is causing him to become \u201cregressive\u201d as the rest of the leftist dominated West is affording vaccine-free citizens their civil rights.\n\nTo the outside world, Trudeau may look like a confident \u2013 if not cringeworthy \u2013 tin-pot dictator, but in reality, he is a 50-year-old boy with little to no virtue. He is essentially a spoiled teenager who can remember lines and present himself well in a tailored suit and has a family name that tricked people into thinking he was competent.\n\nHis (Canadian) father Pierre Trudeau, for all his faults, was shrewd and intelligent \u2013 even if evil. Justin Trudeau is evil and unintelligent and quite obtuse.\n\nI can\u2019t help but think he believes he must prove himself as being his own verified dictator in order to fill his daddy\u2019s shoes.

Sign this Petition Please SIGN and SHARE this petition to the new owner of Twitter, Elon Musk, asking him to reinstate LifeSiteNews' truth-telling Twitter accounts which have been suspended since early 2021. After contentious negotiations, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has purchased Twitter, thereby transforming the tech giant into a private company. A self-styled \"free speech absolutist,\" Mr. Musk's entrepreneurial spirit may define his approach to governing Twitter, where, in the marketplace of ideas, the best ideas - not those aided by censorship - will naturally prevail among the competition. Of course, there are limits to free speech. But, for too long, Big Tech giants (including, Twitter, Google, YouTube and Facebook) have subjected their conservative and Christian users to all forms of censorship, desperately trying to silence our voices. So if, as it seems, Mr. Musk will level the playing field for conservatives and Christians and allow a true exchange of ideas to occur on his platform, then we look forward to our chance to re-engage on Twitter. Please SIGN and SHARE this petition to the new owner of Twitter, Elon Musk, asking him to reactivate LifeSiteNews' truth-telling Twitter accounts which have been suspended since early 2021. They are: https://twitter.com/LifeSite\n\nhttps://twitter.com/LSNCatholic\n\nhttps://twitter.com/WCDM_LSN\n\nhttps://twitter.com/WCEA_LSN These accounts have been blocked by the outgoing Twitter regime for more than a year for calling a \u2018transgender woman\u2019 (Assistant Secretary of Health, 'Rachel' Levine), a man, and for tweeting an article about the same person. The article we tweeted makes mention of the troubling paradox of having a person who denies the basic science of the human anatomy be in an authoritative position in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), but does not cast aspersions or any other such \u201chate speech\u201d against Levine, according to Twitter\u2019s \"rules.\" It is our fervant hope that Mr. Musk intends to allow - rather than censor - our descriptions of reality as we know them to be true in regards to human sexuality, as well as in other areas of life. Mr. Musk evidently understands how significant freedom of speech is to the functioning of a free society as he was quoted as saying that this deal is important for \"the future of civlization.\" LifeSiteNews believes that being able to spread the truth in charity is absolutely vital for the future of society, as the \"truth shall make you free.\" (Jn 8:32) And so, in order for us to charitably spread the truth far and wide, we now seek to re-engage on Twitter's public square. Thank you for SIGNING and SHARING this petition to Elon Musk, urging him to now reinstate LifeSiteNews' suspended Twitter accounts.

The New Democrats have cozied up to Trudeau in order to pretend they are a sane and legitimate party and have promised to prop up his regime. Promises don\u2019t really mean anything when politicians make them, so we shouldn\u2019t assume that the communists will be loyal to each other.\n\nHowever, it is obvious that public opinion is against Trudeau to a degree that he will not be able to withstand.\n\nThere is a reason why Trudeau had to resort to the Emergencies Act to squash the Freedom Convoy; no one wanted to stop it until they were forced to by law.\n\nThe various levels of provincial and municipal governance could have stopped the movement the way they stop any non-violent protest \u2013 but they didn\u2019t want to.\n\nDoes this mean that the cops and all the citizens supported the convoy? Of course not, but I think that enough of them saw how absurd things have become and just wanted something to make the whole charade of 2020-2021-2022 go away.\n\nThe application of the Emergencies Act was wildly unpopular amongst Canadians, both on the Left and the Right. Leftists were happy to see the movement end, but were unimpressed that Trudeau ended it in such an absurd way. Conservatives generally supported the movement, and therefore saw Trudeau as a complete lunatic for doing what he did.\n\nAll of this means that in the long run Trudeau is hurting his reputation, even amongst his base. This is not news for him as the Conservative leadership race heats up.\n\nFreedom is on the move\n\nWithout giving the impression that I think Canada is on the brink of some massive societal restoration, I would be remiss if I did not speak to the positives.\n\nPresently we are witnessing the first real Conservative leadership race in a long time. Pierre Pollievre is filling arenas and convention centres with freedom loving crowds, and Leslyn Lewis is making leftist journalists look silly on national TV. It is worth remember that we are talking about a leadership race, not an election, but the swell of right-wing uprising is palpable.\n\nIn fact, the last time something like this happened was after a groundswell of Christian/right-wing sentiment after years of leftist oppression under the former Trudeau and his successors.\n\nAs a result of that, we had Stephen Harper for a decade who, although not perfect, was a saint compared to Trudeau.\n\nThe economy is tanking in Canada, and goods and services are becoming prohibitively expensive for average people. Trudeau and his cronies can appeal to idealism and progressivism all they want, but even left-wingers get ticked off and want change when they are struggling to fill the tank.\n\nUltimately, Trudeau is continuing to trap vaccine-free Canadians from participating fully in society because he knows that if he pulls the plug on his last failing restriction, that his regime will go down the drain.\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "channel": "lexology.com",
        "text": "All questions\n\nYear in review\n\ni The insurance sector\n\nIn 2021 the Mexican insurance market began to recover from the contraction of 2.9 per cent caused by the pandemic in 2020. By September 2021 the insurance market grew around 5.3 per cent, according to the figures of the CNSF, with a raising of direct premium to 494 billion Mexican pesos, a figure that exceeds the one for 2019.\n\nHowever, the loss ratio increased by 11.9 per cent by the end of September 2021, with an increase of 14.2 per cent in life insurance and of 20.4 per cent in health insurance; the highest increase since the implementation of Solvency II.\n\nThe life and health insurance markets have grown as a result of the pandemic, despite an increase in the cost of premiums partly because of the inflation in private healthcare services. Despite the growth of life and health insurance, the proportion of the Mexican population insured is still very small; according to AMIS' figures, only around 15 per cent of Mexicans in a formal job have a life insurance.\n\nOn the other hand, the drop in travel insurance and coverage for tourist destinations such as Quintana Roo was noticeable early in the year as a result of the pandemic. Automobile insurance was one of the lines of business most affected by the pandemic with a decrease in premium of 2.4 per cent by the end of September 2021 mainly because of the substantial contraction in car sales.\n\nAccording to the CNSF, as of February 2021, the Mexican insurance sector comprises 101 insurance companies licensed to operate in Mexico (of which 56 are subsidiaries of foreign insurance companies) and 241 foreign reinsurance companies registered with the Reinsurance Registry, including Lloyd's of London. Nine atomic pools (nuclear insurance pools) were also registered with the Reinsurance Registry to take reinsurance in Mexico. Direct premiums in the insurance and surety sectors decreased had by 4.6 per cent by the end of September 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Of the total amount of premiums by the end of September 2020, 97.7 per cent came from direct insurance and only 2.3 per cent came from reinsurance.\n\nThe penetration of insurance with respect to Mexico's gross domestic product is 2.3 per cent. In 2020, AMIS and the CNSF announced that they will work together on a strategy to increase penetration to 2.8 per cent by 2022, but no further information has been released on the progress of this strategy.\n\nIn the context of the 30th annual convention of AMIS, the CNSF, the SHCP and AMIS entered into a memorandum of understanding with the purpose of promoting gender equality, diversity and inclusion in the insurance sector.\n\nFor the fourth consecutive time, Mapfre won the public tender to placement of the two-year property and casualty (P&C) policy for Pemex, which represents a total premium of US$563 million.\n\nii Lloyd's\n\nProbitas 1492 (syndicate 1492), Newline Group (syndicate 1218) and Liberty Mutual Re (syndicate 4472) Specialty Services are the only three Lloyd's syndicates with physical presence in Mexico. The lack of appetite of Lloyd's for Latin-American risk continues shifting to other regions and products and in its strategy. It is still unclear how this will affect the business flow and capacity that was traditionally provided to the Mexican market by Lloyd's.\n\nTwo Mexican groups, Grupo Nacional Provincial and Reaseguradora Patria currently have investments in Lloyd's.\n\niii Regulators\n\nThe CNSF has made progress adjusting to the administration of President L\u00f3pez Obrador and, albeit during a pandemic, it is now operating more efficiently. Moreover, the technological tools and procedures that were implemented as a result of the pandemic are now fully in place and the market has become accustomed to them.\n\nRicardo Ernesto Ochoa Rodr\u00edguez continues to serve as president of the CNSF.\n\nThe temporary scheme established on 3 August 2020 by the CNSF regarding the procedure for the calculation of terms based on the level of contingency of the covid-19 pandemic (determined by the federal government) is still in place.\n\nCarlos Noriega, who served as head of the Insurance, Pensions and Social Security Unit in the Ministry of Finance since March 2020, resigned from the position on 1 January 2021, being replaced by Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Tijerina and subsequently by H\u00e9ctor Santana Su\u00e1rez, who currently holds the position.\n\nOutlook and conclusions\n\ni Regulatory\n\nThe CNSF and the SHCP have been clear on their concern about the low penetration of insurance and their commitment to take action for a more inclusive market; however, no relevant actions have been implemented to this end.\n\nWith regard to catastrophic risk, the General Law for Comprehensive Disaster Risk Management and Civil Protection, expected to be approved in 2021, has not yet been approved by the Senate. Currently, the federal government has a catastrophic insurance for up to 5 billion Mexican pesos with a franchise of 275 million Mexican pesos. It also has a CAT-Bond for US$485 million for earthquakes and hurricanes valid until March 2024. However, these instruments are not sufficient to cover the funds of the natural disaster fund FONDEN. After the cancellation of the natural disaster fund FONDEN back in September 2020, the lack of sufficient resources and a reliable mechanism to cover catastrophic risks should be a matter of concern.\n\nThere has been an increase in demand for political risk coverage, given the growing perception of the potential for damage to investors and companies as a result of political decisions by the current government, mainly in the infrastructure and the energy sectors.\n\nWhile the regulators are aware of insurtech's potential to provide access to the benefits of insurance products for vulnerable groups, the present regulatory regime has unfortunately become a hurdle rather than an incentive for the development of products and projects in this area. Coping with compliance and regulatory challenges, including a strict anti-money laundering (AML) regime, data protection and privacy regulations, makes it difficult for start-ups to flourish in this highly regulated industry. Notwithstanding this, new risks continue to require innovative products, presenting new challenges to the regulators. Although the country's industry is solid and well-capitalised, it nonetheless continues to disappoint in terms of penetration, inclusion and innovation.\n\nWe have seen a growth in funds' appetite for working with insurance companies and benefiting from them as institutional investors. The insurance industry has not fully embraced its potential as a key institutional investor, with the exception of a few insurance companies actively investing in private equity, venture capital and other securities, such as development trusts and real estate trusts. There is interest in seeing regulators enhance and provide incentives to insurance companies and we still expect to see changes in insurance companies' investment programmes, in line with the current government's interest in financing long-term infrastructure projects.\n\nii Case law\n\nWe continue to see a growth in insurance and reinsurance-related disputes and related litigation, resulting in the development of court precedents on insurance and reinsurance related matters. The courts are very active in developing the concept of moral damages (similar to that of punitive damages); the concept now forms part of most claims, with important consequences for the insurance industry.\n\nThe contra proferentem principle in insurance continues to be applied, affecting insurance claims that are being argued before the courts.\n\nThe Mexican Supreme Court (SCJN) ruled in favour of the possibility to claim on constitutional grounds through an amparo lawsuit if an insurance company refuses to give coverage on medical expenses to people with Down's syndrome or other disabilities based on that disability. This was a relevant precedent to protect human rights.\n\nOn 17 February 2021, the First Chamber of the SCJN issued a judicial precedent pursuant to which it determined that if a premium is not paid within the grace period of 30 days from the perfection of the contract or as agreed by the parties, the insurance contract terminates automatically, even if the insurer received the premium.\n\nThe rationale of SCJN is based on the assumption that the insurance contract is bilateral, onerous and aleatory, and is perfected at the moment in which the contracting party becomes aware of the acceptance of the offer made by the insurer. Additionally, according to the LCS, from the due date for payment of the premium, the contracting party has a grace period of 30 calendar days to pay the premium. If the contracting party pays the premium after said term and the insurer accepts the late payment, the effects of the insurance contract may not be rehabilitated. According to the criteria of the SCJN, once the insurance contract is terminated, there must be a new offer from the insured and the same shall be agreed with the insurer to formalise a new insurance contract.\n\nMoreover, the SCJN issued a second precedent stating that pursuant to Article 41 of the Law the insurance contract is invalidated when payment of the insurance premium is made outside the grace period of 30 calendar days, even when the insurer does not immediately refuse such payment. In this case, the rationale of the First Chamber of the SCJN, consistent with the judicial precedent described above, is based on the premise that the first paragraph of Article 40 of the Law establishes that if the contracting party does not pay the premium or the corresponding instalment (in the case where it is paid in instalments) within the grace period of 30 calendar days, the effects of the insurance contract will cease automatically at 12 o\u00b4clock on the last day of such term.\n\niii Reinsurance claims\n\nAs previously identified, one of the main sources of disputes in reinsurance stems from fronting arrangements widely used in Mexico in the context of a legal framework where the insurance company maintains its liability to the insured despite the fact that, technically, it is simply fronting the risk. This particular state of affairs \u2013 where reinsurers' lack of understanding of Mexican law and the lack of diligence in policy underwriting to ensure wording considers the effects of Mexican law with regard to English wording of reinsurance placements used in fronting arrangements \u2013 has consistently raised discrepancies between insurance and reinsurance policies and Mexican law, and is the origin of a number of disputes between the London and Mexican markets.\n\nThese inconsistencies are further exacerbated by abusive practices in the handling of claims by the reinsurance market, prejudicing the insurance companies that placed the business through fronting arrangements.\n\nWe have seen some interesting developments in the Mexican AML regime aligned with international standards and these may contribute to harmonising local placements with limitations of liability under international reinsurance programmes.\n\nThere is opportunity in Mexico to use effectively and promote alternative dispute resolution mechanisms specialised in insurance and reinsurance claims, including mediation and arbitration and the use of ARIAS Mexico. The inclusion of arbitration clauses in insurance and reinsurance agreements provides for the resolution of conflicts arising in reinsurance contracts through arbitration and also serves to prevent certain situations arising in global insurance programmes. However, the reinsurance market is still generally reluctant to include mediation and arbitration clauses in reinsurance policies.\n\nIn November 2019, the Principles of Reinsurance Contract Law (PRICL) were published by the Project Group (a joint venture set up by several universities and professors, primary insurance company representatives, reinsurance companies and reinsurance brokers and special advisers) in cooperation with the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (known as UNIDROIT). The PRICL set specific reinsurance rules applicable to contract law, with a view to providing help in areas where reinsurance practitioners felt the need to improve legal certainty. The PRICL have been drafted as soft law, which means they will work as optional guidelines on reinsurance contract law when chosen by the parties, and for these principles to have binding effect, the contracting parties should choose to adopt them voluntarily. However, there is also the possibility that the PRICL may be applied by courts or arbitral tribunals, as the case may be, even in cases where the parties have not chosen to apply them.\n\nThe covid-19 pandemic has also raised conflicting views regarding life reinsurance coverage, with arbitration proceedings under way to resolve disputes between Mexican cedents and foreign reinsurers in relation to coverage during the pandemic.\n\nDisputes between cedents and reinsurers regarding reinsurance coverage of losses caused by the pandemic are still continuing, mainly concerning life insurance. Most of such cases are subject to arbitration, therefore the awards will be confidential.\n\niv Distribution\n\nThere have been no changes and the distribution channels in Mexico continue to be strictly regulated and extremely limited, resulting in a lack of penetration of insurance within small and medium-sized companies, which contributed around 52 per cent of the national gross domestic product during 2019.\n\nBancassurance is one of the most important areas of growth within the industry. With very few exceptions, most banking groups operating in Mexico have transferred their insurance business and operations to insurance groups and entered into exclusive distribution arrangements.\n\nAlthough there has been an increase in distribution through online platforms, the traditional distribution through brokers covers 59 per cent of the premiums.\n\nv Consolidation\n\nWe have seen an active insurance market with various M&A transactions and joint ventures. We expect to see further consolidation or growth, or a combination of these, among the current market participants in Mexico in both insurance companies and intermediaries. In particular, we expect health insurance to be a key driver of growth in the insurance industry in the years to come.\n\nWe have also seen a number of joint ventures between the main insurers and insurtech start-ups and technology companies for boosting their capability to provide new digital client-focused products.\n\nvi Product development\n\nThe interest in parametric insurance products for catastrophic risks keeps growing, and there is extensive activity regarding developing and placing parametric insurance products in the insurance and reinsurance market in Mexico. We also expect to see an increase in the distribution of parametric insurance products for individuals.\n\nThe healthcare insurance business has been one of the main areas to see a growth trend in the past year, with new participants entering the market and the introduction of innovative products. The fact that Mexico has a vast population without medical insurance and which is unable or unwilling to purchase traditional healthcare insurance means the country is an attractive prospect for investors and for launching new products. New products in the area of telemedicine and those with a preventive approach have been successfully placed in the market, and we see continuing interest from various participants in growing their stake in the healthcare insurance business.\n\nCyber insurance continues growing as the risk of hacking and the concern of companies for data protection increases.\n\nSince January 2019 all vehicles circulating in federal roads and motorways must have a liability insurance; however, the federal government has not been able to enforce compulsory motor insurance. According to the financial products ombudsman CONDUSEF, seven out of 10 drivers are not insured.\n\nThere has been an increase in the premiums for providing professional liability coverage that does not reflect conditions in the Mexican market. This adjustment is, in fact, a result of international market conditions and it is evident from this that there is a lack of good underwriting practices for products of this kind being placed in Mexico.\n\nIn 2021, Mexico was the second largest target for fintech investments in Latin America as insurtech start-ups keep penetrating the market. According to Asociaci\u00f3n Insurtech M\u00e9xico (AIM), in 2021 there were 43 insurtech companies already operating in Mexico. Most of the insurtech business is in life and health, and auto and mobility lines, and around half of them are focused on marketing and distribution according to the Radar InsurTech Report 2021.",

Several Democratic senators have signed onto a bill to keep the measure in place.\n\nIn this critical moment, the administration should clearly refine and defend its plans to restore access to asylum and vigorously oppose any legislative efforts to maintain the expulsions.\n\nExpulsions make the border less safe, particularly for those who make repeated dangerous attempts to cross. Each time, migrants and asylum seekers are often increasingly exhausted, dehydrated, and sick. Once expelled, they have been met with cruelty and targeted violence in northern Mexico, remote areas of the jungle in Central America, or their countries of origin. This includes Haiti, where the government has lost control over strategic areas to the hands of dangerous armed gangs, leaving expelled people unprotected.\n\nEach day that the Biden administration continues unlawful expulsions is another day it is enforcing racist immigration policies. In recent weeks, Black, brown and Indigenous asylum seekers have watched white Ukrainians exempted from expulsion, a policy that should apply to all fleeing violence, conflict or persecution.\n\nIn northern Mexico, I recently spoke with a young asylum seeker who pulled down her mask to show a long scar on her face from being slashed in a knife attack in her home country of Honduras. She said she was targeted for being a lesbian and, while traveling to the United States, kidnapped for ransom near the border, beaten, and forced to take off all her clothes as her captors photographed her.\n\nWhen the woman pleaded with U.S. border officials not to send her to either Honduras or Mexico, she said agents laughed at her, and one said, \u201cI don\u2019t care what\u2019s happening to you.\u201d Then, without screening to see if she faced persecution or torture, as is required by law, they expelled her to Honduras, where she faced death threats from gangs. She has since fled again and is hiding out near the border in hopes that the Biden administration will stay true to its word and restore asylum.\n\nThe U.S. government faces an operational challenge to ensure fair, safe and dignified treatment of border crossers. But the administration has already identified and developed some of the tools needed for orderly and humane reception of asylum seekers.\n\nThe border response plans released so far include heavy involvement of the Department of Health and Human Services and Federal Emergency Management Agency and will allow asylum officers to directly adjudicate protection claims.\n\nThe U.S. public supports a well-managed border in which there is an orderly and safe process for those seeking asylum. The Biden administration should be saying more about how it will move toward a more fair and dignified system that protects families, children, adults and vulnerable groups including LGBTQ+ people from harm.\n\nConversely, backtracking on its commitment would align the administration with politicians and groups playing politics with migrants\u2019 lives, entrenching racial discrimination and amplifying the xenophobic fearmongering.\n\nThis column was produced for Progressive Perspectives, which is run by The Progressive magazine and distributed by Tribune News Service.",

        "text": "The Climate Finance Accelerator (CFA) Peru has announced six innovative low-carbon projects that will support access to finance from investors following a call for proposals that attracted 40 applications. The CFA is part of the UK Government\u2019s efforts to support Peru tackle climate change through the UK International Climate Finance.\n\nProjects come from the energy, forest, ecotourism, and waste management sectors and include activities to increase reforested areas in Peru, develop innovative ecotourism experiences and improve production systems using solar energy.\n\nTo ensure the selected projects are in the best position to attract investment from Peruvian and international financiers, the projects will receive capacity building support in areas such as blending finance from public and private sources, developing financial models and preparing pitch material, as well as advice on enhancing gender, equality and social inclusion. If they secure funding in the future, in addition to their climate change mitigation outcomes, the projects will benefit communities across Peru through pollution abatement, employment opportunities, increased energy efficiency, improved public transportation, and by supporting gender equality and social inclusion.\n\nBy bringing together stakeholders who can develop and finance climate projects at scale, the CFA will support Peru\u2019s efforts to meet its commitment under the Glasgow Pact, agreed at COP26 in November 2021, to help keep global warming to within 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nThe British Charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires to Peru, Peter Clements said:\n\n\u201cThe UK is proud to support Peru\u2019s efforts to address climate change and the Climate Finance Accelerator is a great opportunity to do so. At COP26, we could see Peru\u2019s appetite for tackling climate change through increased NDC targets and by joining alliances to protect forests. This cohort of projects will drive innovation in key sectors such as energy, ecotourism and waste management. We cannot wait to see the outcomes.\u201d\n\nLibelula CFA Project Lead Peru, Katherine Bocanegra, said:\n\n\u201cWe are excited to be working alongside these six projects to strengthen their capacity and help increase their chances of finding investment. CFA support will bring projects and financiers together, generating benefits not only for the individual projects, but in the longer term also for Peru\u2019s economy as it builds a climate compatible future.\u201d\n\nTechnical Director CFA Programme Peru, Florian Eickhold of SouthSouthNorth said:\n\n\u201cTime matters! The CFA programme aims to accelerate the final phase of financial closure for already advanced low-carbon projects from a wide range of sectors. This \u201clast mile facilitation\u201d speeds up the implementation of NDCs and helps build the ground for more ambition. I hope financial institutions and project developers are inspired by the CFA process to replicate viable solutions at scale. Every effort is needed to rapidly close the emission gap towards the global goal of 1.5 degrees.\u201d\n\nThe projects have started receiving tailored support ahead of a multi-day event that will be held in May 2022. Support that the projects have received so far has included individual needs assessment discussions as well as financial and technical analysis. The event will allow project proponents to further refine their financial structuring through discussions with interested financial institutions. The event will also provide an opportunity for all participants to network and for policymakers and other initiatives in the climate finance space to learn from the landscape mapping findings and recommendations. The CFA projects include:\n\nCarbon Turnaround: An innovative project for the treatment of organic waste using the Black Soldier Fly technology. Organic waste will be recovered and transformed into insect protein and an organic fertilizer with high nutritional value. Based in Lima, it is managed in partnership with Christof Industries and Grupo GEA.\n\nGrupo Alimenta: Lifesoil\u2122 is our regenerative fertilizer, developed to nourish the soil and crops in a balanced way. Replacing mineral fertilizers with Lifesoil\u2122 does not require additional costs and allows the soil to capture 30 tons of CO2/Ha. We aim to build a network of plants and capture three million tons of CO2.\n\nMarinasol: Installation of floating solar panels within the sedimentation ponds of a shrimp farm, generating renewable energy and contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gases.\n\nNovum Solar: The project aims to develop, build and operate several hybrid energy generation systems (solar, battery and backup diesel) to supply electricity for isolated communities in the Peruvian Amazon. Currently powered by diesel, the communities will have a reliable supply of energy 24/7 and there will be a reduction of 530,000 tons of CO2.\n\nRainforest Expeditions and ACCA: This ecotourism project will protect primary forest and reduce CO2 emissions. It will raise awareness among the local population and 35,000-40,000 visitors a year of the need for conservation and the realities of climate change by providing employment and education.\n\nViridis Terra Per\u00fa SA: This project will create a demonstration and training centre where up to 1,300 people a year will be taught how to restore degraded land, a biotechnology laboratory with the capacity to produce 1.5 million seedlings a year, a solid forest plantation of 1500 hectares, and a natural conservation area of approximately 300 hectares.\n\nFor media enquiries, please contact:\n\nCarmen Noriega Head of Communications at the British Embassy in Lima Carmen.noriega@fcdo.gov.uk\n\nNotes to editors:",

The directors of the Company have determined that his participation in the private placement is exempt from the formal valuation and minority shareholder approval requirements under MI 61-101 in reliance on the exemptions set forth in sections 5.5(c) and 5.7 (1)(a) of MI 61-101 and, in connection therewith, have determined that neither the fair market value of the securities to be distributed in the private placement nor the consideration to be received, insofar as it relates to him, exceeds 25% of the Company's market capitalization. The Company did not file a material change report related to this financing more than 21 days before the expected closing of the private placement as required by MI 61-101 since the details of the participation by the related party of the Company was not settled until shortly prior to the closing of the Private Placement and the Company wished to close on an expedited basis for sound business reasons.\n\nAbout Fjordland Exploration Inc.\n\nFjordland Exploration Inc. is a mineral exploration company that is focused on the discovery of large-scale economic metal deposits in Canada.\n\nIn collaboration with Ivanhoe Electric Inc. and Commander Resources Ltd., Fjordland is exploring the SVB \"Pants Lake Intrusive\" target which is in a geologic setting analogous to the nearby nickel-cobalt-copper Voisey's Bay deposit. Fjordland has earned a 75% interest in the project.\n\nFjordland, as operator, has an agreement to acquire 100% of the Renzy nickel-project located near Maniwaki, Quebec. The project encompasses the former Renzy Mine where, during the period from 1969 to 1972, 716,000 short tons were mined with average grades of 0.70% nickel and 0.72% copper. Fjordland has staked additional claims to increase the size of the project to 530 sq. km.\n\nAs well, Fjordland has 2 copper-gold properties in the Quesnel Trough of central British Columbia, The West Milligan copper-gold project is a joint venture with Northwest Copper Corp. located within 4 km of Centerra's Mount Milligan copper-gold mine.

        "text": "VANCOUVER \u2014 A Federal Court judge has set aside a Department of Fisheries order that would have phased out fish farming in British Columbia's Discovery Islands. Federal Court Judge Elizabeth Heneghan says in a decision issued April 22 that the order made in late 2020 by then-fisheries minister Bernadette Jordan breached the right to procedural fairness owed to the 19 fish farms that were expected to shut down by the end of June. Fish farm operators Mowi Canada West, Cermaq Canada and Grieg Seafood applied for a judicial review of the order that prevented them from restocking their farms, arguing it lacked reasons and didn't \"show an appreciation of the facts.\" Get top stories in your inbox. Our award-winning journalists bring you the news that impacts you, Canada, and the world. Don't miss out. Heneghan agreed with the applicants that when a decision maker departs from a recommended course of action, reasons are required. \"The decision, in the absence of reasons, cannot be justified. In the absence of reasons, it is not transparent. In the absence of reasons, it is not intelligible.\"\n\nHeneghan's ruling supports the fish farm operators' request for judicial review, upholds the injunction that permits restocking of Discovery Island fish farms and sets aside the decision of the minister while a ruling on costs will follow. The BC Salmon Farmers Association said it was encouraged by the decision, however it declined an interview request while it is reviewed the ruling more closely. Trans Mountain pipeline insurers dropping like flies \"This is a positive development for the coastal Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities in which we operate, and the thousands of family-supporting jobs our sector sustains,\" the association says in a statement.\n\nThe Fisheries Department and Minister Joyce Murray did not respond to a request for comment. Heneghan's decision also says submissions of interveners, including the David Suzuki Foundation and Georgia Strait Alliance, focused on issues including constitutional protection of First Nations\u2019 rights and respect for the precautionary principle but didn't address questions such as the lack of procedural fairness. Federal Court tosses B.C. fish farm phaseout for 'procedural unfairness.' #salmon #bcpoli #cdnpoli Mowi argued last year that it would suffer losses of about $26 million, would have to lay off at least 78 people and cancel local contracts if it was forced to cull 1.18 million salmon smolts instead of transferring them to the Discovery Island farms. Fish farming has been a contentious practice on the B.C. coast, where some have raised concern about potential impacts on wild stocks. The Cohen commission on the decline of Fraser River sockeye in 2012 described the Discovery Islands as a bottleneck along wild salmon migration routes.\n\nHowever, one of the commission's key recommendations to eliminate fish farms along that route was contingent on Fisheries and Oceans finding more than a minimal risk to migrating stocks by September 2020. That condition was not met. Instead, by September 2020, nine reports by the Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat concluded that fish farming in the Discovery Islands posed no more than a minimal risk to wild stocks, the Federal Court decision says. Bob Chamberlin, who chairs the First Nations Wild Salmon Alliance, said the industry's participation in the preparation of those reports, which is also noted in the court decision, raises questions for him about their independence.",

        "text": "In December 2021, President Biden signed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (\"UFLPA\") into law. The UFLPA creates a rebuttable presumption that goods \"mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part\" in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (\"XUAR\") of China, or by certain other entities in China, are made with forced labor and that such goods, wares, articles, and merchandise are not entitled to entry to the United States.1 The presumption applies unless the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (\"CBP\") determines that the importer of record has complied with certain due diligence and evidentiary standards. The UFLPA requires CBP to publish guidance on the due diligence and evidentiary standard needed to rebut the presumption after a formal rulemaking process. The UFLPA also requires the Forced Labor Enforcement Task Force (\"FLETF\"), an interagency group dedicated to preventing the import of goods made with forced labor into the US, to \"develop a strategy for supporting enforcement of Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1307) to prevent the importation into the United States of goods mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part with forced labor in the People's Republic of China.\"2 For more information on the contents of the UFLPA, please refer to our previous Legal Alert on the subject.\n\nThe rebuttable presumption will enter into force on June 21, 2022, the same day that the FLETF must submit its initial strategy to Congress for review. The FLETF has already solicited written comments and hosted a public hearing to inform its strategy.\n\nOn April 12, 2022, CBP announced on its website that, in advance of June 21, 2022, the date of enter into force of the rebuttable presumption, CBP will be issuing letters to importers that it has identified as having previously imported merchandise that may be subject to the UFLPA to encourage them to address any forced labor issues in their supply chains in a timely manner. CBP noted that not receiving a letter is not an indication that a company's supply chain is free of forced labor. CBP urged all importers to thoroughly review their supply chains, regardless of whether they received a letter, to ensure that their supply chains do not use any convict labor, forced labor or indentured labor, including any forced or indentured child labor.\n\nFootnotes\n\n1.

        "text": "FIRST ON FOX: Hunter Biden's longtime business partner Eric Schwerin visited the White House at least eight times in 2016, meeting with then-Vice President Biden's chief of staff Steve Ricchetti, who currently serves as Biden's White House counselor, and an assistant in Biden's office who used to work at the investment firm Schwerin and Hunter managed.\n\nThose eight additional visits, in addition to 19 previously known Schwerin visits, bring his total number of White House visits during the Obama-Biden administration to 27.\n\nSchwerin, the president of since-dissolved investment fund Rosemont Seneca Partners, visited Ricchetti at least twice in 2016. The two visits occurred in room 272 on Feb. 29 and room 276 on Aug. 17 at the Old Executive Office Building (OEOB), according to the 2016 White House visitor logs.\n\nRicchetti has been a longtime adviser to President Biden and served as his chief of staff from 2013 to 2017. He now serves as Biden's White House counselor.\n\nSchwerin also met with Anne Marie Person, who served as a general assistant at Rosemont until 2014 before joining Biden's office, at least three times between February and June 2016, a Fox News Digital review found. According to White House visitor logs, Schwerin met her in Biden's \"West Wi[ng]\" office on Feb. 24, April 8, and June 9. It is unclear if Biden was present for the meetings.\n\nPerson is not only a former assistant at Rosemont Seneca Partners, but she is also the sister of Francis \"Fran\" Person, a longtime Biden aide who left the White House a few months after she joined Biden's office in May 2014. He served as an advisor to Biden between 2009 and 2014, where he traveled to 49 of the 50 countries Biden visited, including China. FOX Business previously reported on Fran's ties to Hunter Biden and Schwerin and how their private equity firm had a financial stake in a company run by Fran and a Chinese executive with ties to officials at some of the highest levels of the Communist Party of China.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoth Person siblings kept in frequent contact with Hunter and Schwerin during their Obama-Biden administration roles using their government emails, according to emails reviewed by Fox News Digital.\n\nIn addition to Person and Ricchetti, Schwerin made three other visits with staffers from Vice President Biden's office in 2016. Schwerin met with John McGrail, who was a counselor to Biden, on July 15 and Sept. 9 at the White House. He also met with Kaitlyn Demers, who was serving as an associate counsel in Biden's office in 2016, on June 28. She is currently a special assistant to President Biden and Chief of Staff Ron Klain.\n\nThe new revelations follow a New York Post report exposing Schwerin visited the White House and other official locations at least 19 times between 2009 and 2015.\n\nOne of Schwerin's visits - in November 2010 - was a sit-down with Biden in the West Wing as he was still president of the now-defunct Rosemont Seneca Partners.\n\nEight of Schwerin's other visits between 2009 and 2013 were with Joe and Jill Biden aides, the Post reported.\n\nBiden met with Hunter Biden business partner at White House in 2010: Report\n\nA White House official deflected on a media inquiry from Fox News Digital about Schwerin's visits to the White House during the Obama administration by criticizing \"transparency\" issues in the Trump administration.\n\n\"These are all meetings that have been public for years because both the Obama-Biden Administration and this administration released visitor records for the sake of transparency - a practice discontinued during the Trump years,\" the official said.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki was asked about the visits on Monday but sidestepped the question.\n\n\"On Hunter Biden, the New York Post is reporting, looking at White House visitor logs, that there were 19 visits to the White House while the president was vice president by Hunter Biden's business partner, including one with the vice president,\" said a PBS reporter in the briefing.\n\n\"Can you help us understand why that business partner had access and what those meetings were about?\"\n\nPsaki responded by saying she didn't have any knowledge of the meetings.\n\n\"I don't have any information on that,\" she said. \"I'm happy to check and see if we have any more comment.\"\n\nSchwerin did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.",

But the company banned him from the platform in the wake of the January 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol. Twitter said that after reviewing Trump's tweets and the context surrounding them, it decided to permanently suspend his account \"due to the risk of further incitement of violence.\"\n\nThe former president used his Twitter account in the weeks between the 2020 presidential election and the January 6 insurrection to encourage his supporters to gather in Washington in protest of the election, which he falsely claimed was rigged against him.\n\nTrump does not yet use Truth Social, though Devin Nunes, a former congressman from California who serves as the CEO of the Trump Media and Technology Group, said that's \"coming soon.\"\n\n\"President Trump has no reason to go back to Twitter, and why would we want to go and be reliant on anyone?\" Nunes told Fox News' \"Fox & Friends\" in an interview Tuesday.\n\nHe and other Republicans have accused sites like Twitter and Facebook of censoring conservative voices and have called for the repeal of a 1996 law that shields social media companies from being held liable for content posted by their users.\n\nTwitter announced Monday that it reached an agreement with Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, to buy the company. The deal values the company at roughly $44 billion.

        "channel": "thehill.com",
        "text": "House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) warned that impeachment could be on the table for Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas during a trip to the southern border with other GOP lawmakers.\n\nThe border trip is meant to kick off a week where Republicans plan to seize on the issue to bolster their midterm election chances \u2014 and to put the pressure on Mayorkas, who is set to testify to the House three times on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nMcCarthy has been in the headlines for days over audio recordings of him telling other GOP lawmakers that he thought an impeachment resolution against former President Trump over the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol would pass and that Trump should resign. McCarthy denied making the remarks, before audio was released in which he could be heard making the comments.\n\nOn Monday, McCarthy suggested that he was not being untruthful because he was answering questions about whether he told Trump, which he said he \u201cnever did,\u201d redirecting attention to the border.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s more important than something that happened 15 months ago on a private conversation with about four other people is what\u2019s happening here right now,\u201d McCarthy said, later adding that it is Biden\u2019s Homeland Security official who should worry about impeachment if the GOP takes the House.\n\n\u201cThis is his moment in time to do his job. But at any time if someone is derelict in their job, there is always the option of impeaching somebody,\u201d McCarthy said of Mayorkas in a press conference from Eagle Pass, Texas.\n\n\u201cBut right now, he\u2019s got 30 days. His first response to us should be, \u2018We should not lift Title 42,\u2019 \u201d McCarthy said. \u201cThey\u2019re not prepared to protect, and we cannot sustain what will happen to this nation.\u201d\n\nTitle 42 was first implemented by the Trump administration and later the Biden administration during the coronavirus pandemic to turn away migrants at the border. It allowed both administrations to deny asylum-seekers a hearing before a judge. The Biden administration has been sued over the issue and has said it will lift Title 42 on May 23. Later on Monday, a federal judge temporarily blocked the Biden administration from lifting the policy.\n\nThe issue has been a political gift to Republicans, who have hammered the administration over border security as vulnerable Democrats in the House and Senate have criticized Biden over the decision.\n\nA GOP-controlled House impeaching Mayorkas is far from unlikely. Republicans need to pick up just a handful of seats to take the majority, and 30 House Republicans have signed on to an impeachment resolution, led by Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), against Mayorkas.\n\nMembers of House GOP leadership have not gone quite as far, but on the border trip and through other measures, they are steadily escalating their criticisms.\n\nHouse Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik (N.Y.) said in a tweet that after hearing from local officials and community members on the trip, she sees the border situation as \u201cabsolutely heartbreaking and a dereliction of duty from Joe Biden and House Democrats.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy, Stefanik, and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) also joined a Monday letter to Mayorkas led by Reps. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) and Brian Babin (R-Texas) that cast doubt on his ability to carry out his job duties.\n\n\u201cYour failure to secure the border and enforce the laws passed by Congress raises grave questions about your suitability for office,\u201d said the letter, signed by 133 Republican House members in total.\n\nMigrant encounters at the southern border have hit a 22-year high, according to the Department of Homeland Security, though that is partly attributable to migrants making more than one trip to the border under Title 42.\n\nThe Biden administration says Title 42 is a public health policy and that it should not be continued because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it is no longer necessary. It argues it does not have the authority to put it in place as an immigration policy.\n\nIt has also said a return to regular processing under immigration law will make it harder for would-be migrants to surreptitiously cross the border, since the criminally prosecuted would risk being put in jail instead of being sent back across the border.\n\nMayorkas will address the Biden administration\u2019s budget request for his department before the House Appropriations and House Homeland Security committees on Wednesday and will appear in an oversight hearing with the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday.\n\nMonday\u2019s congressional delegation was meant to showcase GOP unity on border and migration issues ahead of the midterm elections. Both bomb-throwers like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who accused Biden of being a \u201cgreat business partner to the cartels,\u201d and more moderate members such as Rep. Blake Moore (R-Utah) offered criticism of the administration.\n\nMoore, who co-chairs the bipartisan Congressional Future Caucus that aims to solve problems with civility rather than hyper-partisanship, said that he does not speak much to the national media but that he is focusing on border issues because his constituents have brought it up in \u201ccountless\u201d town halls.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let politics guide you. Address the policy. Enforce the \u2018Remain in Mexico\u2019 policy. It is a compassionate program, it will keep border activity to a minimum,\u201d Moore said, referring to a separate Trump administration policy under legal challenge that the Supreme Court will consider on Tuesday. The policy requires asylum-seekers at the southern border to stay in Mexico while their applications are processed.\n\nAlso on the border trip were Rep. Tony Gonzales (Texas), whose district includes Eagle Pass; House Republican Policy Committee Chairman Gary Palmer (Ala.); Texas Reps. Chip Roy and Randy Weber; Rep. Diana Harshbarger (Tenn.); and Rep. Michael Guest (Miss.).\n\n\u201cBiden bears responsibility for this. I don\u2019t see how he sleeps well at night,\u201d Weber said.\n\nDays earlier in Eagle Pass, a 22-year-old Texas Army National Guard specialist, Bishop Evans, died after he tried to save two migrants crossing into the U.S. through the Rio Grande. He went missing on Friday, and the Texas Military Department of Affairs said Monday that his body was recovered.\n\nThe tragedy fueled Republican arguments that there is a humanitarian crisis at the border.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019d just secure our border and do our job, we wouldn\u2019t have that loss of life,\u201d Roy said in a video taken at Eagle Pass Monday morning.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) has deployed thousands of National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border over the last year.\n\nMcCarthy pledged to fix border issues if Republicans win back the House.\n\n\u201cIn 30 days from now, President Biden could lift Title 42. It will be unsustainable beyond means of what will happen to this nation. We got to be able to first to stop that,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cAnd then, in 197 days from now, we can secure this border once and for all.\u201d",

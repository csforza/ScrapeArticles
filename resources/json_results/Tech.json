        "text": "Cyber security issues are one of the biggest concerns for organizations today and have become front-page news as we are firmly in an era of digital expansion.\n\nDigital transformation, combined with external factors like the Covid-19 pandemic and geopolitical issues, has seen the network boundaries of organizations expand exponentially and the attack surface is greater than it has ever been. Coupled with the fact that threat actors continue to improve and evolve their tactics, CISOs and security owners are under pressure to ensure that their organization is protected.\n\nJoin CS Hub\u2019s flagship event Cyber Security Digital Summit: Global 2022 to learn more about ransomware today, building a modern threat detection and response program, how to mitigate supply chain attacks and incident response planning.\n\nAt the 2022 iteration of CS Hub\u2019s flagship event you will hear from the likes of James Johnson, CISO at John Deere, Muhittin Hasancioglu, cyber security advisor and former CISO at Petronas, Lynn Dohm, executive director at Women in Cybersecurity, and many more.\n\nRegister here for the Cyber Security Digital Summit: Global 2022, taking place on 3 \u2013 5 May\n\nIn this article discover three key takeaways to expect from attending the event.\n\nProtecting against today\u2019s ransomware threats\n\nRansomware is not a new phenomenon but we continue to see organizations fall victim to such attacks. Ransomware gangs have stepped up their tactics and organizations must keep pace to mitigate such attacks.\n\nDuring the Global Summit industry-leading experts will discuss how to detect even the stealthiest ransomware programs as well as preventing them from hitting your network.\n\nYou can also join day one\u2019s discussion where AttackIQ\u2019s Andrew Costis ask the question: \u201dIs it ever OK to pay a ransom after an attack?\u201d. The answer is not as simple as yes or no and you will hear the pros and cons of paying as well as other factors to consider on the topic of ransomware.\n\nFind the full Cyber Security Digital Summit: Global 2022 agenda here\n\nBuilding a threat detection and response program\n\nThreat detection and response provides the backbone of any security program but there is a clear need to ensure you have the latest tools available to guarantee your efforts stand up to today\u2019s threats.\n\nWith traditional approaches often proving to be inefficient, slow and resulting in blind spots, it is time to reevaluate and ensure your program is up to scratch.\n\nOne option is to consider a cloud-native SIEM and SOAR which leverages automation and enables scalability. This will be explained by Arnaud Loos and Greg Kushmerek from Chronicle.\n\nMeanwhile, presenters from Open Systems will also discuss how to successfully evaluate a managed detection and response (MDR) service provider to successfully bolster your existing program.\n\nFind the full Cyber Security Digital Summit: Global 2022 agenda here\n\nPreventing supply chain attacks\n\nAn organization\u2019s third-party supplier has now become a weak link in the security chain as threat actors are now leveraging the digital supply chain to infiltrate a target\u2019s network.\n\nThe recent Okta incident provides a good example of such an incident. During the leaders\u2019 panel at Cyber Security Digital Summit: Global 2022 security practitioners from Petronas, Northrop Grumman and John Deere will discuss lessons that have been learned from such incidents.\n\nBy attending this year\u2019s event, uncover how a risk-based approach can help you mitigate these third-party risks and learns ways to evolve your security requirements for partners you select.",

        "text": "(Kitco News) The International Monetary Fund said that Russia could use the crypto universe to get around the Western sanctions that have been imposed on the country since it invaded Ukraine in February.\n\n\"The war in Ukraine has brought to the forefront some of the challenges that regulators face in terms of applying sanctions and capital flow management measures,\" the IMF said. \"The crypto ecosystem, however, could allow users to circumvent such requirements through several means.\"\n\nRussia has been cut off financially from the rest of the world, with Western sanctions trying to pressure Russia to force it to retreat or give up the war altogether.\n\nHowever, according to the IMF's financial stability report, Russia could use its embargoed energy sector to mine Bitcoin and raise revenue that way.\n\n\"Mining for energy-intensive blockchains like Bitcoin can allow countries to monetize energy resources, some of which cannot be exported due to sanctions. The monetization happens directly on blockchains and outside the financial system where the sanctions are implemented,\" the report described. \"Miners can also generate revenues directly from users that pay transaction fees to miners (which in this case might be sanctioned governments).\"\n\nThe IMF added that the monthly average of all Bitcoin mining revenue last year was around $1.4 billion. Out of this total, Russian miners accounted for about 11%.\n\nRussia could also potentially circumvent sanctions by using exchanges that are \"noncompliant with sanctions,\" by using poor implementation of due diligence procedures by crypto asset providers, and via crypto's anonymous transactions, the IMF noted.\n\nThe report also pointed out that crypto asset trading volumes against some emerging market currencies have soared after sanctions were introduced against Russia.\n\nThe IMF's advice is for countries to create or amend regulations around crypto to make sure such possibilities are accounted for.\n\n\"Laws and regulations for foreign exchange and capital flow management measures should be reviewed and amended if necessary to cover crypto assets, even if they are not classified as financial assets or foreign currency,\" the report said. \"Regulators in the United States and United Kingdom, among others, have urged firms in their jurisdictions, including the crypto asset sector, to increase vigilance with regard to potential Russian sanction evasion attempts.\"\n\nThe report added that one way to solve this would be to bring crypto under the same capital control requirements as traditional assets.\n\nThe idea of how Russia could be avoiding Westen sanctions has been under increasing scrutiny lately, with many pointing to Russia's gold reserves, which were left largely untouched by sanctions.\n\nThe Global Initiative against Organized Crime (GI-TOC) warned last week that Russia could use the \"well oiled\" wheels of the illicit gold market to get around the sanctions.",

Its \"DDoS Testing suite\" consists of a planning session with Red Button experts for scoping out attacks. In addition, Red Button also will execute DDoS test attacks on Azure services used by organizations. Lastly, the suite offers a report summarizing the vulnerabilities detected and areas of improvement.\n\nThe actual DDoS test attacks get carried out by Red Button or partner BreakingPoint Cloud.\n\nIn addition to its DDoS Testing suite, Red Button offers two other options for Microsoft's Azure DDoS Protection customers. Its \"DDoS 360\" service is an annual service that offers testing, hardening, incident response and skills development. A second offering its \"DDoS Incident Response\" service, is a \"30-day incident response service\" that helps with DDoS attacks and the aftermath, plus training.\n\nThe three offerings -- the DDoS Testing suite, DDoS 360 and DDoS Incident Response -- aren't free for Microsoft's Azure DDoS Protection customers. They represent three separates costs, according to a Microsoft spokesperson.\n\nOf course, organizations that subscribe to the Azure DDoS Protection service are already paying for DDoS detection and attack mitigation services from Microsoft to safeguard their apps and services. Back in January, Microsoft touted Azure DDoS Protection as being resistant to disruption by DDoS attacks because the cloud service can rapidly scale up operations when resources get sapped by DDoS attacks.\n\nThe Red Button collaboration can help organizations needing to meet certain compliance criteria, the Microsoft spokesperson clarified, when asked why Red Button would be needed on top of Azure DDoS Protection.\n\nAzure services offer comprehensive DDoS defenses. However, our customers sometimes require independent testing and validation services to document security compliance.\n\nRed Button is also a DDoS test partner for Amazon Web Services and \"authorized to conduct DDoS simulation tests on behalf of AWS customers without prior approval from AWS,\" per Red Button's description.\n\nThe top DDoS organizational targets are gaming services providers, followed by financial services companies and media organizations, according to Microsoft. It tallied 359,713 unique DDoS attacks against its own services in the second half of 2021. These denial-of-service attacks involve the sending of massive requests using the User Datagram Protocol, which is typically used by streaming and gaming services.",

        "channel": "securities.io",
        "text": "Utrust (UTK) operates as a decentralized cryptocurrency payment processor. The network focuses on e-commerce businesses via a suite of proprietary features and products. The goal of the project is to make it easy for businesses to seamlessly accept cryptocurrency payments. To this extent, Utrust continues to deliver with more businesses joining the protocol weekly.\n\nWhat Problems Does Utrust (UTK) Solve?\n\nOne of the primary issues that Utrust seeks to solve is slow business adoption. Cryptocurrencies are faster, more efficient, and secure than fiat currency, yet many businesses don\u2019t accept these digital assets due to volatility concerns. There are businesses that want to accept cryptocurrencies, but don\u2019t know where to begin to make the process a reality. Utrust was built to provide these users with full support.\n\nThe protocol helps to alleviate merchant concerns through its easy-to-navigate dashboard. New users can find all the features they need to start accepting crypto payments today. The system was built from the ground up to mitigate volatility and improve returns for merchants.\n\nConversion delays\n\nPart of this strategy includes reducing conversion delays. The crypto market is volatile with price changes happening every minute. As such, it\u2019s vital for a merchant processor to complete transactions in near real-time to ensure no loss in value from the point of sale to the finalization of the transactions. Utrust provides immediate conversion from crypto to fiat currency to ensure there is no loss in value incurred by merchants.\n\nLack of Consumer Protection\n\nAnother major problem in the crypto merchant sector is a lack of consumer protections. Cryptocurrencies bring some advantages, but there are some caveats, such as the inability to refund on public blockchains. Utrust introduces a variety of buyer protections to improve the scenario.\n\nUtrust focuses on securing transactions between buyers and sellers. Specifically, buyers and sellers enjoy more flexibility such as the ability to communicate prior to the transaction to improve verification. This approach streamlines the exchange between both parties and improves the overall user experience.\n\nInflation\n\nInflation is another concern that has made headlines recently. Inflation occurs when a currency losses buying power. It\u2019s one of the worst things that can happen to savers because it steals their wealth. Utrust integrates deflationary protocols to prevent inflation from causing issues to users.\n\nSpecifically, a small percentage of the fees are converted into UTK and burned. Burning tokens refer to removing them from circulation forever. To accomplish this task, the developers will send the tokens to an address that has no withdrawal option. The goal of this process is to reduce the overall supply. In turn, this drives up the demand which results in higher token values.\n\nBenefits of Utrust (UTK)\n\nThere are a lot of benefits that Utrust users gain. For one, the payment processing services were designed to provide seamless integration into current PoS systems. This easy onboarding benefits consumers and merchants as the protocol requires no previous experience to manage. Best of all, merchants receive their payments in fiat currency.\n\nDashboard\n\nThe Utrust interface is where users access all of the features of the network. The developer went to great lengths to ensure the dashboard was efficient and easy to navigate.\n\nLow Fees\n\nThose seeking an affordable alternative to PayPal and other centralized online payment processors should consider Utrust. The network has low conversion fees and there is no exchange rate fee when conducting transactions in the network\u2019s native utility token, UTK. The network charges a small 1% commission and conversion fee for normal transactions.\n\nFlexibility\n\nAnother reason why Utrust has become so popular is its flexibility. The network supports different digital currencies and fiat currencies. As such, it operates as a low-cost solution for any business seeking a flexible international online payments processor.\n\nHow Does Utrust (UTK) Work\n\nUtrust works through a combination of systems. The network makes it easy to accept digital currencies. It combines the most popular features found on traditional payment gateways with the security of blockchain technology. This structure enables the protocol to conduct real-time business-to-consumer transactions.\n\nWhen a transaction is sent, the network automatically converts the cryptocurrency into fiat currencies in real-time. This process is completely autonomous and the network seeks out the lowest conversion rate as part of the process. Notably, there is a holding period in place for new merchants to prevent fraud. As your reputation builds and you conduct more transactions, the holding period gets waived.\n\nUtrust wallet\n\nThe Utrust wallet makes it simple to conduct crypto transactions. This versatile digital wallet can store a variety of popular ERC-20 tokens and popular cryptocurrencies. The protocol was built to operate on your favorite mobile device. Anyone can store their UTK tokens and buy products using this wallet.\n\nToken\n\nThe UTK token is an essential component of the Utrust network. It\u2019s the main utility token for the Utrust system. Users save when they conduct transactions using this token. They can also send UTK across the globe in seconds using the peer-to-peer network. Notably, UTK is an ERC-20 standard token that lives on the Ethereum blockchain. As such, it enjoys a high level of interoperability in the market.\n\nHistory\n\nUtrust entered the market in October 2017 during the crypto breakout. The network was founded by Artur Goulao, Filipe Castro, Nuno Correia, and Roberto Machado. It currently lists Sanja Kon as CEO. Kon has an expansive history of working as the Head of Marketplaces and Large Enterprises at PayPal. Today, Utrust is a top-performing crypto payment processor in the market.\n\nHow to Buy UTRUST (UTK)\n\nCurrently, UTRUST (UTK) is available for purchase on the following exchanges.\n\nBinance \u2013 Best for Australia, Canada, Singapore, UK and most of the world. USA residents are prohibited from buying UTRUST (UTK). Use Discount Code: EE59L0QP for 10% cashback off all trading fees.\n\nKuCoin \u2013 This exchange currently offers cryptocurrency trading of over 300 other popular tokens. It is often the first to offer buying opportunities for new tokens. This exchange currently accepts International & United States residents.\n\nGate.io \u2013 This exchange was established in 2013, and is one of the more popular & reputable exchanges. Gate.io currently accepts most international jurisdictions including Australia & the UK. USA & Canada residents are prohibited.\n\nHuobi Global \u2013 Established in 2013, Huobi Global has since become one of the world\u2019s largest digital asset exchanges, with an accumulated trading volume of US $1 trillion. It should be noted that Huobi Global currently does not accept USA or Canadian residents.\n\nUtrust \u2013 Bridging the Gap\n\nThe Utrust strategy is to help bring more businesses into the crypto sphere. This makes sense as they have the most to gain from such a venture. Additionally, this step is essential to drive large-scale crypto adoption in the future. For these reasons, you can expect to see Utrust continue to expand its network of merchants and users over the coming months.",

Here's how the cloud-based disaster recovery services work and how the best providers stack up.\n\nWe may be compensated by vendors who appear on this page through methods such as affiliate links or sponsored partnerships. This may influence how and where their products appear on our site, but vendors cannot pay to influence the content of our reviews. For more info, visit our Terms of Use page\n\nFacing a multitude of threats to systems and data, everyone from small and medium businesses to large enterprises and nonprofits are turning to cloud backup and recovery services. Combining both data backup protections and recovery capabilities, disaster recovery as a service solutions help ensure continued operations should a catastrophe, failure, accident or other adverse event occur.\n\nJump to:\n\nSEE: Hiring Kit: Database engineer (TechRepublic Premium)\n\nWhat is disaster recovery as a service?\n\nDRaaS is a cloud computing strategy in which an organization pays a provider to protect the organization\u2019s data and information from disruption \u23e4 due either to natural disasters, human error or cyberattacks \u23e4 by enabling full operational recovery using a cloud-based solution.\n\nHow does DRaaS work?\n\nDRaaS works in various ways. In some cases, a disaster recovery services vendor will leverage a small appliance installed on-premises at a client\u2019s site. These appliances collect backup images and send backup information offsite where it can later be used to recover operations at a new location. In other cases, DRaaS solutions target continuous data replication to permit spinning up disaster recovery services in the cloud or at another location.\n\nRegardless of the data backup and synchronization strategy, most DRaaS solutions offer many common capabilities, including encrypted data transfer, offsite replication, emergency recovery and maintenance.\n\nWhat are the benefits of using DRaaS?\n\nThe benefits of using DRaaS are that organizations can integrate these cloud-based services within their larger business continuity and disaster recovery plans to properly protect systems, applications and data in a way that also fulfills their specific disaster recovery requirements.\n\nProper and effective disaster planning requires addressing numerous elements, such as system, application and data backups, safe storage of those backups, and quick recovery. DRaaS providers offer a complete smorgasbord of options to organizations of all sizes operating across all industries. These providers tailor their DRaaS solutions to an organization\u2019s specific needs.\n\nA small advertising firm may survive if recovery operations take several days. However, a large accounting firm might need to return to regular operation in just an hour were a disaster to occur during the height of tax season.\n\nTop DRaaS providers and solutions\n\nAcronis Cyber Disaster Recovery for Acronis Cyber Protect\n\nAcronis offers a variety of cloud-based data protection and recovery solutions. While some Acronis products, such as Acronis Cyber Protect Cloud, are designed for managed services providers to wield assisting customers, still others are built specifically for businesses and organizations.\n\nPaired together, two Acronis products provide organizations with a powerful one-two punch. Known as Acronis Cyber Disaster Recovery for Acronis Cyber Protect, this DRaaS solution creates a powerful combination to both protect data and applications and enable disaster recovery.\n\nThe primary product, Acronis Cyber Protect, gives businesses potent backup and recovery software that also includes integrated cybersecurity features. Its single console simplifies managing data and endpoint protection, reducing administration overhead while identifying and resolving issues. Starting at $79 for small- and medium-size environments, the software permits making image, file and local backups. The platform permits bare metal recovery and the recovery of production systems to dissimilar hardware. It is compatible within Windows, Linux, VMware ESXi and Microsoft Hyper-V environments.\n\nAdding another Acronis solution, Acronis Cyber Disaster Recovery, boosts effectiveness. The service adds a streamlined disaster recovery process in which testing failover and failback of protected data, applications and systems is both enabled and simplified.\n\nThe Acronis Cyber Disaster Recovery add-on also enables other critical capabilities. Using the add-on, administrators can customize recovery point objectives that help ensure the most current data is recovered. In the event of a disaster, the add-on also permits recovering and running an organization\u2019s operations directly from Acronis\u2019 cloud server environment. Such potentialities prove critical in the event of floods, fires, tornados and other disasters.\n\nPricing depends upon a number of variables, including the number of protected machines and the amount of data being stored. Firms can test the solution for free for 30 days.\n\nContact Acronis directly at 1-781-782-9000 for more information or with questions.\n\nCarbonite Recover\n\nBoasting push-button failover, Carbonite Recover is a DRaaS offering that reduces the risks of unplanned downtime and operations interruption by securely replicating critical applications and data to the Carbonite cloud. Subsequently, an up-to-date production environment becomes available for immediate failover.\n\nUsing Carbonite\u2019s solution, primary servers can replicate in real-time, at the individual byte level, to the DRaaS cloud (Figure A). Organizations can perform their own non-disruptive, self-service tests, and access and view failover reporting. In the event organizations need more assistance, Carbonite\u2019s technical services team can also provide support, including for deployment, testing and recovery.\n\nFigure A\n\nThe solution works by installing a Carbonite Recovery agent on each system to be protected. Following service configuration, those systems then begin sending encrypted data continuously, and with little adverse performance impact according to the vendor, to the Carbonite cloud.\n\nWhen an outage occurs, organizations can spin up the cloud-based replicas to recover operations. Then, once an organization is ready to return to using its primary production systems, the process is essentially reversed.\n\nSupported across a variety of environments, including Windows, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, VMware and Hyper-V, pricing is based on the number of endpoints, the amount of data and the types of assistive services the organization selects.\n\nContact Carbonite directly at 1-877-542-8637 for more information or with questions.\n\nDatto ALTO & SIRIS\n\nDatto, whose acquisition by Kaseya was announced in April 2022, provides a range of DRaaS and BCDR offerings for MSPs (Figure B). The company\u2019s ALTO and SIRIS solutions provide data protection solutions that also include full BCDR capabilities.\n\nFigure B\n\nDatto ALTO is a cost-effective and reliable hardware device that replicates an on-premises server and supports up to four Datto agents. The device serves as an onsite backup, but the solution also includes cloud-backup capabilities. Holding up to 2TB of data, customers can run operations from the device itself or from Datto\u2019s cloud.\n\nDatto SIRIS is similar to ALTO except SIRIS permits managing an unlimited number of agents for accommodating more servers and virtual machines, including VMware ESXi and Microsoft Hyper-V VMs. SIRIS is scalable, as up to 120TB can also be backed up using the solution. With SIRIS, backups can be performed as frequently as every five minutes, including on Windows, Linux and Mac machines.\n\nDesigned for larger environments, Datto SIRIS supports physical, virtual and cloud infrastructure, permits restoring data from any point in time and enables replicating server images directly to the cloud. Ransomware protection, flexible restoration and indefinite cloud retention are other features.\n\nCost varies by the product and amount of data stored. Although Datto takes pains to simplify pricing, the firm works directly with MSPs, who are permitted to customize their own pricing plans. Because pricing can be included within MSP\u2019s regular recurring monthly service agreements, organizations working with an MSP can wrap the DRaaS pricing directly within a monthly service contract, should an organization choose to do so.\n\nContact Datto for more information or to find a reseller at 1-888-294-6312.\n\nDRaaS Tierpoint\n\nTierPoint Disaster Recovery as a Service sells its DRaaS services directly to businesses. With customizable disaster recovery services, the firm aims to assist a variety of organizations, whether those firms require cloud-to-cloud recovery, on-premises or data center server-to-cloud recovery.\n\nDepending upon the service chosen, TierPoint leverages Dell Technologies\u2019 Recover Point for VMs, Nutanix\u2019s native DR platform, VMware\u2019s vCloud Availability or Zerto\u2019s IT Resiliency Platform. Permitting replicating from any cloud to a TierPoint cloud within an organization\u2019s region, this DRaaS platform permits backing up and exchanging data from anywhere while also meeting VM-level near-synchronous replication to minimize any chance for data loss.\n\nTierPoint\u2019s DRaaS offering also offers automatic failover, permitting recovery in just minutes at a secondary site.

Kyndryl\u2019s Hybrid Platform Recovery with DRaaS service assists such firms in addressing business continuity risks even when using a variety of disparate solutions and multiple cloud systems. Designed for rapid response and recovery, with results guaranteed by SLAs specifying RPO and RTO requirements, the service strives to minimize any operations disruptions resulting from outages.\n\nThe hybrid platform works by creating and capturing server image and production information to replicate that data to the cloud. The service also supports automated failover and failback between on-premises, public cloud and hybrid environments.\n\nKyndryl\u2019s Recovery Retainer Service, meanwhile, provides organizations seeking such assistance with access to Kyndryl\u2019s team of technical specialists and recovery experts, as well as tools and technologies for recovering operations when an event occurs. The Recovery Retainer Service also assists assessing, strengthening and maintaining an organization\u2019s BCDR planning. Among the services included with the solution are 24/7 support and up to 150 annual retainer hours of labor.\n\nPricing is dependent upon multiple factors, including SLA terms and the tier level of support an organization requires. For more information, contact Kyndryl at 1-855-596-3795.\n\nInterVision DRaaS\n\nFormerly known as Bluelock, InterVision acquired this DRaaS firm in 2018. InterVision Disaster Recovery as a Service provides customers using on-premises Windows and Linux systems, virtual machines and even those working within hybrid environments with advanced failover and failback capabilities, including to Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure platforms.\n\nWith four Service Level Agreement options, InterVision can match a DRaaS solution to an organization\u2019s custom needs. Customers can choose from the following four SLA types:\n\nInfrastructure availability: Infrastructure necessary for recovery is guaranteed to be ready when a customer declares a disaster.\n\nInfrastructure necessary for recovery is guaranteed to be ready when a customer declares a disaster. Replication service: Because replication traffic will already be working, client RPOs aren\u2019t jeopardized.\n\nBecause replication traffic will already be working, client RPOs aren\u2019t jeopardized. Recovery team response: Regardless of day or time, InterVision\u2019s Solutions team is guaranteed to be ready to assist recovery within minutes of a disaster being declared.\n\nRegardless of day or time, InterVision\u2019s Solutions team is guaranteed to be ready to assist recovery within minutes of a disaster being declared. Recovery time objective: InterVision commits to meeting specific, predetermined recovery time objectives, including for application recovery.\n\nAs is common with DRaaS offerings, pricing is dependent upon a variety of factors.

From powering identity management services and virtual desktops to provisioning innovative software development environments, Azure solutions cover an almost bewildering array of functions.\n\nAzure Backup and Azure Site Recovery are but two of a multitude of Azure-powered solutions (Figure C). Teamed together, the two Azure offerings provide a complete DRaaS solution.\n\nFigure C\n\nCapable of securely backing up on-premises and cloud-based servers, virtual machines and Windows and Linux systems, Azure Backup provides everyone from SMBs to enterprise environments a centralized backup center that assists monitoring, administering and scaling backup operations. Whether working with file servers, databases, VMs or other technologies, the offering also supports using APIs, PowerShell and the Azure command-line interface to manage and automate backup and security parameters.\n\nAzure Site Recovery fulfills the second half of the DRaaS function after backing up or replicating data: Recovery. Organizations begin by replicating Azure VMs to a different Azure region, thereby providing geographic protection from common failures and disasters. Azure Site Recovery also permits administrators to retain application availability during primary system outages thanks to automatic recovery, including from an on-premises platform to Azure or from one Azure region to another.\n\nMicrosoft Azure is available from MSPs and VARs, as well as from the vendor directly. For more information, contact Microsoft at 1-855-270-0615.\n\nNutanix Disaster Recovery\n\nSimilar to other cloud providers, Nutanix offers a variety of cloud services, from data analytics to desktops as a service to BCDR solutions. The firm\u2019s Data Disaster Recovery platform simplifies replicating data across multiple sites to ensure and speed disaster recovery.\n\nWith always-on availability across multiple sites and geographic distancing, the DRaaS solution replicates data synchronously, thereby minimizing data loss and downtime. With the ability to continue powering business operations even when multiple sites fail simultaneously, Nutanix assists in implementing aggressive RPOs and RTOs to permit rapid recovery.\n\nBoasting centralized management and supporting the administration of both on-premises and cloud platforms, the service permits customizing BCDR plans as an organization requires. Nutanix\u2019 DRaaS service also integrates with third-party data protection solutions to better enable granular data recovery.\n\nThe firm\u2019s services can be purchased from resellers as well as directly from Nutanix, For more information on the company, contact Nutanix at 1-855-NUTANIX.\n\nQuorum DRaaS\n\nAvailable from partners or directly from Quorum itself, Quorum onQ claims status as a leader in the single-click instant recovery space. By automatically maintaining current critical system and application data on ready-to-run VM clones of an organization\u2019s physical and virtual servers stored on a dedicated appliance, recovery can be simplified to a single click.\n\nBuilt on top of high-availability infrastructure, the Quorum solution supports storing backup archives and images for the long term. The solution also offers isolated sandbox environments for testing patches and upgrades, deduplication to reduce storage and bandwidth requirements and a host of migration tools.\n\nCompatible with both on-premises and cloud servers, standalone or VMs, Quorum\u2019s service actually tests server snapshots each time a snapshot is made. Such automated DR testing helps ensure operations can be properly recovered, including full bare metal restores to dissimilar hardware and from physical to virtual or virtual to physical servers.\n\nFor more information, contact Quorum at 1-877-997-8678.\n\nServiceNow Business Continuity Management\n\nSold via partner programs and directly to businesses, ServiceNow\u2019s Business Continuity Management solution includes the traditional array of DRaaS features, including setting RTO and RPO targets. The service also supports practicing recovery operations, activating continuity plans and monitoring backup and recovery tasks.\n\nThe solution includes yet other capabilities, too. Using the service, organizations can help eliminate surprises by using data stored within the ServiceNow continuity management platform to monitor for risks and identify possible gaps in recovery capabilities.\n\nOne of the persistent challenges with BCDR plans is the rate at which production environment components change. ServiceNow\u2019s BCDR\u2019s services assist organizations in managing such issues by permitting automation of plan maintenance with larger BCDR workflows powered by the ServiceNow platform.\n\nServiceNow\u2019s business continuity management initiative also encourages prioritizing critical applications, services, processes and sites. Subsequently, ServiceNow\u2019s DRaaS solutions offer compelling benefits, especially for firms that depend on ServiceNow for CRM, DevOps and other operations assistance.\n\nFor more information, contact ServiceNow using its Contact Us page.\n\nShadowProtect\n\nPlagued by a data loss event that primarily impacted MSP clients beginning in March 2022, Arcserve\u2019s StorageCraft backup service proved prone to human error. An extended period of degraded operation, in which business\u2019 data backups reportedly proved inaccessible, looks to have been due to mistakes made when preparing backend upgrades, according to Arcserve\u2019s CEO.\n\nWith Arcserve working diligently to solve the problem and communicating proactively with customers and partners, the firm remains a player within the DRaaS space. The ShadowProtect brand was long previously trusted to enable both data backups and recovery.\n\nSold by partners as well as directly to businesses, StorageCraft\u2019s ShadowProtect DRaaS boasts cross-platform coverage, including for Windows and Linux systems, physical servers and VMs. The storage-agnostic solution supports most disk-based storage technologies, including the OneXafe NAS storage format. With broad hypervisor support, including for Microsoft, Red Hat Enterprise and VMware technologies, the service offers the typical DRaaS scheduling, replication, testing and migration features SMBs and enterprises require.\n\nFor more information, contact StorageCraft at 1-801-545-4711.\n\nVMware Site Recovery\n\nSold by partners and direct, VMware Site Recovery protects both on-premises and VMware AWS and Dell EMC installations. The solution is an add-on service for organizations using VMware Cloud on AWS and VMware Cloud on Dell EMC.\n\nPowered by its own vSphere technologies, including VMware\u2019s native vSphere Replication hypervisor software and the VMware Site Recovery Manager, the DRaaS solution reduces secondary recovery site requirements and expenses by leveraging cloud replication advantages, which permit accelerating recovery efforts.\n\nBy pairing configurations, such as a client\u2019s physical production site with a recovery target powered by VMware Cloud on AWS, DRaaS can be integrated with other VMware administration and operation components. As is now expected from enterprise solutions, the platform supports non-disruptive recovery testing and verification. Because fast recovery is so important, the solution can assist by automating and managing critical business operations when an unplanned outage occurs.\n\nLicensing and compatibility issues can arise due to the service\u2019s goal supporting a wide range of technologies. Fortunately, VMware maintains online tools, including the VMware Product Interoperability Matrices and the VMware Compatibility Guide, organizations can use to plan and research potential issues.\n\nAvailable on-demand or via one- and three-year commitments, subscription fees are paid upfront, whereas on-demand usage is billed hourly and invoiced monthly. VMware Site Recovery is priced as a separate add-on from VMware Cloud on AWS but includes the VMware Site Recovery Manager and vSphere Replication elements needed for recovering either to a VMware Cloud on AWS instance or an on-premises box.\n\nContact VMware with questions or for more information at 1-877-486-9273.\n\nZerto Disaster Recovery as a Service\n\nZerto, now an HP enterprise, provides a range of DRaaS services via an expansive partner network. The company\u2019s offerings include both continuous data protection (CDP) as well as DRaaS options.\n\nThe Zerto technologies eliminate snapshots in favor of a CDP strategy that the vendor states results in \u201cindustry-lowest\u201d RPOs and RTOs. The platform, software and hardware are agnostic, thereby encouraging compatibility with a wide range of production systems. Zerto DRaaS services permit storing data on premises and in the cloud or any combination therein, and, because hundreds of MSPs serve as partners, design, implementation and support services are widespread.\n\nOther features include non-disruptive testing, spatial geographic protection and an option to fully automate recovery and mitigation efforts. The solution also benefits from its approachability, in that its software-only administrative interface smooths adoption and management.\n\nOrganizations can choose from multiple billing models. Pay-as-you-go plans are available, as are a variety of data protection and support options. For more information, contact Zerto on its Contact Us page.",

If you want to read about some more crypto firms, go directly to 5 Biggest Crypto Companies in the World.\n\nCryptocurrencies have witnessed increased institutional investor interest in recent months as inflation climbs and the appeal of popular coins as a safe haven and wealth storage device soars in a volatile marketplace. Chainalysis, a crypto information firm, revealed in a report on April 20 that crypto investors around the globe had realized total gains of $162.7 billion in 2021, up from just $35.5 billion in the previous year. The United States led other countries in these gains with over $47 billion, followed by the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan.\n\nOne of the interesting things highlighted in the report, and perhaps a stark reminder of the capabilities of the revolutionary blockchain technology, was that countries that do not rank high on traditional measures of economic prosperity, like the gross domestic product (GDP), usually outperform in the crypto space. For example, Turkey, which ranks 11th in the world in terms of GDP, is sixth in realized cryptocurrency gains at $4.6 billion. Ukraine, a symbol against Russian aggression, is 40th in GDP but 13th in realized cryptocurrency gains at $2.8 billion.\n\nThe report also discussed in detail the cryptocurrency developments in China, one of the largest crypto markets in the world. In 2021, the total estimated realized cryptocurrency gains for China were $5.1 billion, up from $1.7 billion in 2020. Although this represented an annual growth rate of an impressive 194%, despite a regulatory crackdown against blockchain tech in China, it was far lower than growth rates of other crypto countries like the US, at 476%, and the UK, at 431%, and Germany, at 423%.\n\nEmerging Trends: Ethereum Edges Bitcoin, NFTs Explode\n\nAnother emerging theme within the crypto industry, which is gaining mainstream recognition through efforts of firms like Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), is the performance of Ethereum, the second most-popular coin, against Bitcoin. Per Chainalysis, the total realized gains globally for Ethereum were $76.3 billion, compared to $74.7 billion for Bitcoin. Several experts had previously forecast that Ethereum was a better long-term investment than Bitcoin.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor example, Tally Greenberg, the head of business development at crypto firm Allnodes, is of the opinion that \u201cthe technological advantage and utility of Ethereum blockchain is far greater than that of Bitcoin\u201d. Megan Kaspar, the managing director of asset management firm Magnetic, has forecast that there will be an institutional investor shift towards Ethereum as the importance of new updates to the Ethereum network, which include a shift towards a more environmentally-friendly mining option, become more apparent.\n\nWithin the crypto sector, the non-fungible tokens marketplace is also exploding. NFTs are just one way in which blockchain technology can reshape the world around us. An NFT is a non-interchangeable unit of data stored on a blockchain, a form of digital ledger, that can be sold and traded. Some examples include digital forms of photos, videos, and audio. A report by Nonfungible recently outlined that trading in NFTs climbed close to $18 billion last year, an increase of 21,000% from 2020.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThe companies that operate in the crypto sector were selected for the list through a careful assessment of business fundamentals to provide readers with some context for their investment choices. The growth catalysts for these firms are also discussed to paint a more holistic picture.\n\nBiggest Crypto Companies in the World\n\n10. Chainalysis\n\nChainalysis is a software firm that provides blockchain data and analysis to governments, banks, and businesses across the globe. One of the premier products of the company is compliance, regulatory, and investigative software related to blockchain technology. This software can detect and prevent various illegal activities like money laundering. This is a key competitive edge for the firm as hacks and related privacy concerns around blockchain tech are clouding the future development for the sector.\n\nOne statistics that highlights this competitive edge is the number of customers that Chainalysis serves. Nearly 650 organizations that include crypto exchanges, leading banks, payment processors, hedge funds and venture capital firms, use Chainalysis software. The firm recently launched Cross-Chain Investigations to Reactor, a tool that helps customers trace cryptocurrencies and related digital assets across blockchains. In June last year, the company had raised over $100 million at a Series C funding round at a valuation of over $4 billion.\n\nJust like Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), Chainalysis is one of the crypto firms that elite investors are flocking to as the risk/reward profile of the growth sector improves.\n\n9. Uniswap\n\nUniswap is a cryptocurrency exchange that embraces the transparency at the center of the blockchain revolution. The exchange is used on blockchain networks that run open-source software. This is in contrast to other crypto exchanges that are run on centralized servers. A growing number of developers, traders, and liquidity providers are using the functionalities of the platform. Per the company, it has so far generated over $935 billion in trading volume and more than 95 million trades. The platform had more than three million users at the end of 2021.\n\nUniswap has the highest market shares among decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges at close to a quarter of all trades. It also has the highest daily trading volume in this group. On Uniswap, transactions are executed on-chain but there is no central authority that is facilitating these trades. Rather, users are free to interact with other users through a secure system and trade directly through their crypto wallets. These transactions are transparent and also open-source, decreasing the likelihood of money laundering.\n\n8. Kraken\n\nKraken is a cryptocurrency exchange and bank. It is based in California and was founded in 2011. The exchange already operates in more than 60 countries across the world. It was recently granted a license to start operations in the UAE as well. The Middle East is one of the fastest-growing crypto markets. Chainalysis estimates that nearly 7% of the global crypto trades originate from the region. Kraken is the first firm to offer direct trades of UAE dirhams against Bitcoin. The UAE trades about $25 billion worth of cryptocurrency each year.\n\nKraken is the fourth largest exchange in the world in terms of trading volume. More than six million users are on the platform for crypto trading. These users are spread across 190 countries. Jesse Powell, the CEO of the firm, has previously said that the exchange could go public in late 2022. The company is valued at close to $20 billion. The exchange has a daily trading volume in the hundreds of millions. In January last year, at the height of the crypto craze, the exchange did $56 billion worth of trading, more than the trading for the entire year in 2019.\n\n7. Sandbox\n\nSandbox is a metaverse platform. The platform, which initially started out as a game available for playing on computers and mobiles, operates on a play-to-earn model. The blockchain-based version of Sandbox allows users to create their own avatars, which can also be traded, to access different kinds of environments and games within the metaverse. The platform is the biggest of its kind in the crypto space and has more than 2 million users. These users can also trade in virtual real estate within the metaverse.\n\nIn 2021, the total land sales volume on Sandbox stood at over $350 million. Nearly 80% of this volume occurred in the last quarter of 2021. Secondary sales during the period were up more than 1.600% quarter-over-quarter. The number of active buyers on the platform grew in all four quarters of 2021 and increased by 37% between October and December. The median price for Sandbox land was $1,308 at the end of the third quarter but jumped to a median price of $11,364 by the end of the year.\n\n6. OpenSea\n\nOpenSea is a marketplace for non-fungible tokens. As of early 2022, the platform has more than 600,000 users. This represents a huge increase over March 2020, when the users on the platform numbered just 4,000. The monthly viewing numbers for the OpenSea website are more impressive. The site attracts over 120 million visits per month, per conservative estimates. This puts it far ahead of the competition in the NFT market sector. In 2021, the company made more than $365 million in revenue from NFT sales on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIn 2020, the revenue of OpenSea was just $525,000. The difference highlights the incredible growth that NFTs have made in the crypto space. The marketplace charges 2.5% for every transaction on the platform. This is similar to what competitors like Rarible charge. The company is estimated to be worth more than $13 billion. So far, the firm has raised more than $427 million in financing over nine funding rounds. $300 million of this came at a Series C funding round in early 2022.\n\nIn addition to Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), OpenSea is one of the companies that institutional investors are monitoring.\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Biggest Crypto Companies in the World.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nDisclosure.

        "text": "Westford, USA, April 25, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IoT devices are proliferating on a large scale, and various enterprises are developing newer technology use cases that make use of IoT devices. Several pioneers are implementing blockchain solutions to build a decentralized network of IoT devices, eliminating the need for a central location to handle device communication. Blockchain technology is expected to allow devices to communicate directly with one another, eliminating the need for any other monitoring system. During the forecast period, the retail and e-commerce segment is expected to grow at the fastest rate. The retail and eCommerce application area is a global network of suppliers, retailers, eCommerce portals, and customers interacting in physical stores and digital online channels. Today, all retail and eCommerce organizations are making significant investments to provide clients with a better customer experience.\n\nRead market research report, \"Global Blockchain Market Segmented By Component (Platforms and Services),By Provider (Application, Middleware, and Infrastructure),By Type (Private, Public, and Hybrid),By Organization Size(Large Enterprises, SMEs), By Application Area(Transportation and Logistics, Agriculture and Food, Manufacturing, Energy and Utilities, Healthcare and Life Science, Media, Advertising and Entertainment, Banking and Financial Services, Insurance, IT and Telecom, Retail and Ecommerce, Government, Other application area), and Region - Forecast And Analysis 2021-2027\u201d by SkyQuest\n\nGet sample copy of this report:\n\nhttps://skyquestt.com/sample-request/blockchain-market\n\nRetail and eCommerce businesses can expect to gain customer loyalty if they provide a positive customer experience. Blockchain technology enables retailers to use smart contracts to resolve customer disputes without the intervention of a court. Smart contracts are stored in a digital ledger, allowing customers to securely record all transactions on the blockchain ecosystem, such as receipts, warranty documents, and insurance papers. The transaction is open to the public and cannot be changed or tampered with. All parties involved in the transaction are held accountable for their contractual obligations, and action is taken automatically if conditions are not met. For instance, an Israeli blockchain startup provides a blockchain application for retailers to improve overall efficiency in maintaining customer records such as warranty, insurance papers, and receipts. Customers can easily access information about their purchases and earn loyalty or reward points thanks to the information stored on the blockchain digital ledger.\n\nCustomers receive immediate assistance in the event of a product malfunction, without any service delays. Furthermore, blockchain allows retailers to access and accept cryptocurrencies rather than purchasing items through a payment processing system. It facilitates secure and authenticated online transfers. When compared to credit card payments, the blockchain payment process is less expensive.\n\nNorth America is expected to have the largest market share in the Blockchain market . Early Blockchain adoption, as well as the presence of several companies offering security and Blockchain solutions, are expected to drive market growth in the region. Companies in this region are increasingly implementing security and application security solutions to enable data security, prevent cyber-attacks and commercial espionage, and ensure data security and privacy for business continuity.\n\nAccording to TripleA, a cryptocurrency solution provider, more than 300 million people worldwide will use or own cryptocurrency in 2021. The growing demand for blockchain in the government sector is driving market growth, owing to benefits such as the protection of sensitive data, lower costs, and improved efficiency. Various government agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in the United States, are requesting blockchain-based applications to improve data security.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is funding start-ups to conduct research and development to investigate new approaches to cyber security using blockchain technology. Over the forecast period, the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have a positive impact on market growth. Growing online sales as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic are expected to drive demand for blockchain technology among e-commerce firms. This technology is used by e-commerce companies to manage their supply chains.\n\nThe report published by SkyQuest Technology Consulting provides in-depth qualitative insights, historical data, and verifiable projections about market size.

        "channel": "wired.com",
        "text": "Elon Musk became the new owner of Twitter on Monday, after completing a stunning $44 billion takeover of the social media platform, ending a process that has vacillated between a done deal and dead in the water in the last three weeks.\n\n\u201cFree speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,\u201d Musk said in a press release announcing the news. Twitter independent board chair Bret Taylor described the deal as \u201cthe best path forward\u201d for the company\u2019s shareholders.\n\nThe result ends prolonged speculation over Musk\u2019s financial interest in Twitter. On April 4, the entrepreneur\u2019s 9.2 percent stake in the company\u2014or 73.5 million shares at a cost of around $2.4 billion\u2014was disclosed to the public. At the time, the purchase of stock in Twitter came with an offer to sit on the board\u2014though on April 10 Musk declined to take his seat.\n\nHe soon made it obvious that he wanted the whole thing. On April 14, Musk offered to buy the remaining percentage of the company for $54.20 per share\u2014a 38 percent premium on the price he paid for his initial investment. Musk\u2019s accompanying letter to the chair of Twitter\u2019s board was strident in its criticism of the platform. \u201cI believe in [Twitter\u2019s] potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy,\u201d he wrote. However, he added, \u201cI now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form.\u201d\n\nInstead, he wanted to take the company private, offering $44 billion for it in a \u201cbest and final\u201d offer. At the time, analysts were split about the likelihood of Musk\u2019s bid succeeding, and whether it was good value; while it sat in the middle of the usual 30 to 40 percent premium above the trading price, the stock price had reached well above that just last year. Twitter\u2019s board, for its part, said it would evaluate the offer.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s setting a bit of a precedent for activists that will go after a company,\u201d says Timothy Galpin, senior lecturer in strategy and innovation at the Said Business School at the University of Oxford. \u201cIt\u2019s been done a bit before by Carl Icahn and a few others, but it\u2019s not as prevalent to go after the whole company.\u201d\n\nOn the same day that he lodged his bid to take over the entirety of Twitter and take it private, Musk appeared at a TED talk in Vancouver, where he laid out his vision. \u201cThis is not a way to sort of make money,\u201d he claimed. \u201cMy strong intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important.\u201d That gave some within Twitter, and those who held large shares in the platform, pause.\n\nContemporary reports indicated Twitter would fight to repel Musk, while the Tesla and Space X CEO got into a Twitter spat about press freedom with Saudi Arabia\u2019s Kingdom Holding Company, a major shareholder that said it would reject Musk\u2019s offer. (Saudi Arabia has been accused of the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.)",

        "text": "\u00a9 The Hill illustration, Madeline Monroe/AP photo, Matt Rourke\n\nElon Musk\u2019s acquisition of Twitter is raising questions about how it will impact the company, American politics and online communication.\n\nMeanwhile, positive COVID-19 tests from Democratic senators and Vice President Harris is further delaying a vote on President Biden\u2019s nominee to fill a vacant Federal Trade Commission (FTC) spot.\n\nThis is Hillicon Valley, detailing all you need to know about tech and cyber news from Capitol Hill to Silicon Valley.

Will banned users return?\n\nMusk has laid out a more relaxed vision for content moderation that would lean toward temporary \u201ctimeouts\u201d over permanent bans.\n\nAdvocacy groups are concerned that this switch could reverse Twitter\u2019s permanent bans on public figures and politicians \u2014 including former President Trump.\n\n2. Leadership changes: While Musk and Twitter did agree on a deal for taking the company private on Monday, the purchase itself may take until the end of 2022 to wrap up while shareholders vote on the agreement and regulatory hurdles are cleared.\n\nDuring that time, CEO Parag Agrawal and the independent board that approved the offer will remain in charge of Twitter.\n\n3. How could the product change?: Major changes are likely to wait until the deal is completed.\n\nMusk has given some hints to what those could look like beyond his commitment to \u201cfree speech.\u201d\n\n4. Washington\u2019s ire: Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are using Musk\u2019s takeover to fuel their respective battles against powerful tech companies.\n\nRepublicans are embracing Musk as an ally in their fight against \u201cBig Tech.\u201d\n\n5. How will Twitter\u2019s workers respond?: Twitter has long been known as one of the most open places to work in Silicon Valley.\n\nWorkers have been encouraged to share their thoughts and feelings on the platform for years. Many of them did just that Monday as news of the deal broke, expressing confusion and dismay.\n\nRead more here.\n\nCOVID ABSENCES FURTHER DELAY FTC VOTE\n\nThe vote on Alvaro Bedoya\u2019s nomination to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is expected to be further delayed due to COVID-19 linked absences in the Senate, according to a senior Senate Democratic aide.\n\nSens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Vice President Harris all tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday.\n\nRepublicans have broadly pushed back on Bedoya\u2019s nomination to the FTC, leaving Democrats in need of all senators and Harris present to secure his confirmation.\n\nThe Senate aide said absent to an objection by Republicans, the Senate is expected to delay the consideration of Bedoya to a later date.\n\nThe Senate Commerce Committee advanced Bedoya in a vote along party lines in March, after delays based on Sen. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n\u2019s (D-N.M.) absence while he recovered from a stroke.\n\nAs he awaits confirmation, the FTC remains split along party lines, thwarting Democrats from pushing forward with their full agenda.\n\nEU WARNS MUSK\n\nThierry Breton, the European Union\u2019s commissioner for the internal market, tweeted Tuesday that Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who just secured a deal to buy Twitter, will have to comply with the commission\u2019s rules on moderation.\n\n\u201cBe it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules \u2014 regardless of their shareholding,\u201d Breton tweeted. \u201cMr Musk knows this well.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is familiar with European rules on automotive, and will quickly adapt to the Digital Services Act.\u201d\n\nRead more here.\n\nBITS AND PIECES\n\nAn op-ed to chew on: Elon Musk\u2019s Twitter purchase brings free speech into sharp focus\n\nLighter click: happy carrot time\n\nNotable links from around the web:\n\nWhat Elon Musk\u2019s battles with Washington might mean for Twitter (Politico / Emily Birnbaum)\n\nHow to Become a MAGA Rap Kingpin (Without Believing What You\u2019re Saying) (Rolling Stone / Alice Hines)\n\nFacebook Doesn\u2019t Know What It Does With Your Data, Or Where It Goes: Leaked Document (Motherboard / Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai)\n\nOne last thing: Truth Social struggles\n\nShares that are tied with the company funding former President Trump\u2019s latest social media venture, Truth Social, took a dive on Monday after social media platform Twitter announced its deal with Tesla CEO Elon Musk.\n\nCNBC reported that Digital World Acquisition Corp.\u2019s shares fell to nearly 13 percent on Monday, bringing the company\u2019s year-to-date losses to more than 30 percent.\n\nTruth Social, which officially launched in February, was created by Trump after he was permanently banned from multiple social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram for actions involving the Jan.6 insurrection at the Capitol, CNBC noted.\n\nRead more here.\n\nThat\u2019s it for today, thanks for reading.

        "text": "By Matt Egan | CNN\n\nElon Musk\u2019s quest to become a social media mogul is dealing a blow to Donald Trump\u2019s social venture.\n\nShares of Digital World Acquisition Corporation, the controversial blank-check firm that plans to merge with Trump Media & Technology Group, fell 13% on Monday to close at $35.71.\n\nThat\u2019s the lowest level since the Trump deal was announced last October \u2014 and the selloff comes as Musk reaches a deal to take over Twitter, one of the Big Tech companies Trump had vowed to take on. At one point, the stock was down as much as 19%.\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group recently launched Truth Social, a Twitter clone aimed at conservatives whom Trump claims Twitter has silenced.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to download Truth Social if you can get it on Twitter,\u201d said Matthew Kennedy, senior IPO market strategist at Renaissance Capital, which provides IPO-focused ETFs and pro-IPO research.\n\nSince the final trading day before Musk surprised Wall Street by saying he had amassed a stake in Twitter, Digital World has lost 44% of its value. The special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, closed at $63.25 on April 1 before Musk\u2019s announcement April 4.\n\nMusk, a longtime critic of Twitter\u2019s content moderation policies, has vowed to transform Twitter in part by bolstering free speech on the platform. The Tesla CEO agreed to buy Twitter in a deal that values the company at about $44 billion.\n\nA Musk-run Twitter would undercut the rationale for Truth Social, which Trump had promised would \u201cstand up to the tyranny of Big Tech.\u201d There is even speculation that Twitter, under Musk\u2019s control, could lift the ban on Trump himself.\n\nTrump weighed in on the issue on Monday, telling Fox News he will not return to Twitter despite Musk\u2019s takeover.\n\n\u201cI am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,\u201d Trump told Fox News. \u201cI hope Elon buys Twitter because he\u2019ll make improvements to it and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth.\u201d\n\nBelow $36, the implied valuation of Trump Media & Technology Group has tumbled to roughly $7.7 billion, according to Kennedy of Renaissance Capital. That\u2019s down sharply from around $13 billion before Musk disclosed his Twitter investment.\n\n\u201cWhile the market apparently believes that a Twitter owned by Elon Musk dims the outlook of Truth Social, Trump still has some financial incentives to use Truth,\u201d Kennedy said.\n\nBeyond Musk\u2019s efforts to acquire Twitter, the Trump SPAC has been hurt by the slow start of Truth Social. As CNN reported earlier this month, Truth Social has been plagued by a lengthy waitlist, a lack of content and high-profile contents that appear to be bots.\n\nAt the same time, federal regulators are investigating the Trump SPAC deal and legal experts have told CNN that securities regulators could slow or even derail the merger altogether.\n\nSince hitting a 2022 high of $101.87 on March 2, Digital World is down by about 65%.",

        "text": "Elon Musk\u2019s planned takeover of Twitter, and his desire to return what he describes as \u201cfree speech\u201d to the platform, has buoyed many of those on the right wing in America, who have seen themselves, or their cohorts, banned in recent years.\n\nFor one prominent rightwing Twitter exile, however, the prospect of a return to the powerful social media website causes mixed emotions and a difficult dilemma.\n\nIf Donald Trump, who was permanently suspended from Twitter in January 2020 due to the risk of him inciting violence, rejoins the platform then he will once again have access to a tool he has acknowledged helped him defeat Hillary Clinton in 2016, taking back his ability to dictate the news cycle and communicate with the 88 million followers that were snatched away in an instant.\n\nShould Trump do so, however, it will represent an admission that Truth Social, the former president\u2019s own ailing social media effort, released earlier this year as a supposed alternative to Twitter, has failed \u2013 adding the fledgling platform to a long list of Trump\u2019s business missteps.\n\nBut beyond the embarrassment, a return to Twitter, and to Trump firing out messages attacking Democrats and Republicans alike, could also be a dent to Republican chances in the November midterm elections.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a strong case that having Trump back on Twitter would help Democrats win votes by forcing Republicans off-message, reminding swing voters how much they disliked the former president, and driving up progressive turnout,\u201d said Matt Gertz, a senior fellow at Media Matters for America, a left-leaning media watchdog.\n\nSenior Republicans appear to agree. After news of Musk\u2019s takeover, news website Politico contacted several top Republican members and aides to gauge reaction to a potential Trump Twitter return.\n\n\u201cEvery single one of them told us that they hoped the former president stays the hell away from Twitter,\u201d Politico reported.\n\nTrump himself has said he won\u2019t be back, telling Fox News: \u201dI am going to be staying on Truth.\u201d\n\nThe twice-impeached former commander-in-chief is not known for his consistency, however. He has reportedly expressed discontent with how Truth Social has performed \u2013 \u201cWhat the fuck is going on,\u201d the Daily Beast reported Trump as asking aides in March \u2013 and to return to relevance, and to win back the spotlight he craves, the former president might need Twitter.\n\n\u201cIf he wants to intervene on behalf of a candidate he has now endorsed in the midterm elections, being able to reach that number of people with messages supporting those candidates is a way of essentially getting free advertising time to reach people who are more likely to vote as a result of getting a signal from Donald Trump,\u201d Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, told Time.\n\nTrump may have insisted that he will snub Twitter and stick with Truth Social, but his commitment to his own platform has so far been tepid at best \u2013 Trump has posted on Truth Social just once.\n\nIf that lack of interaction hasn\u2019t helped Truth Social, neither did the botched rollout on 21 February. Tens of thousands of people were unable to access the network \u2013 the Guardian was finally allowed in on 5 March \u2013 and by early April the Truth Social app was the 355th most popular on Apple devices.\n\nIn terms of daily active users, Truth Social had 513,000, the Daily Beast reported. Twitter has about 217 million.\n\nLack of usage \u2013 both by Trump and by the general public \u2013 is not the only problem the new network faces.\n\nShares in Digital World Acquisition Corporation, the firm which plans to merge with Trump Media & Technology Group, dropped 13% on Monday after news of Musk\u2019s deal. Since Musk became the largest shareholder in Twitter TMTG shares have fallen by 44% overall, and two key Truth Social executives quit the platform in April.\n\nSince Trump was removed from Twitter his missives have been limited to email blasts sent from his Save America Pac, the messages frequently bleating about a \u201cstolen election\u201d in 2020. At the moment those emails are received by a mixture of supporters and vaguely interested journalists.\n\nIf Trump resumed tweeting, he\u2019d have a far bigger audience for his misinformation \u2013 which could have serious consequences.\n\n\u201cThe real danger would come after election day,\u201d Gertz said, \u201cwhen he could use that same megaphone to spread lies about voter fraud as a pretext for overturning elections. If that happens, another January 6 \u2013 perhaps a more successful one \u2013 is very much in play.\u201d",
